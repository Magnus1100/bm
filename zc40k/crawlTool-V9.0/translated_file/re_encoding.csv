Alesta,1,9.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alesta/,"You know, they say, ""The continuation of the first game"", that's exactly what.

The game continues with Titus, the hero of Ultramarines.Titus joined Deathwatch to pay some kind of penance after the events he had experienced in the past, and now he is again between Ultramarines.The story begins with the Tyranid invasion, and at this point, you experience the phenomenon of ""a Space Marine who knows nothing but war"".Titus's story is almost a mythological expression of war and heroism, but frankly what we call ""heroism"" works a little different here.Heroism is mostly based on defense and destroying the enemy.

It is incredibly satisfactory to control Titus.Each step is shaking the enemies, every stroke destroys them.The game is forcing you to stay awake against your enemies.Because it's not enough to be strong, it is important that you timing and escape.Especially defense against the moves of the Tyranids keeps you awake in the game.

Warhammer remains loyal to the universe, game graphics and sound design is really impressive.They have implemented the miniatures of Games Workshop.Every enemy, every environment, as if you have jumped out of your desktop game.In the middle of the war, as the gothic structures wandered, the atmosphere really draws you into it.




The three-player Co-op mode is absolutely successful and if you have friends playing the game by entering the mode, the PVP mode is the feeling that the Space marins are well balanced and play Gears.



Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a good experience.It is a perfect refreshing both for new ones in the Warhammer universe and for old fans.The depth of gameplay, the atmosphere of the story and the quality of multiplayer mode, this game is one of the memorable games of 2024.If you like action, strategy and some dark science-fiction, you should definitely try this game.Satisfying, exciting and a beautiful work that will accompany you on your return to the Warhammer universe.

+Saber Interactive, Warhammer unexpectedly committed the universe well

Dootslayer,1,173.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050419580/,"Listen brothers! I have waited more than 10 years for this game.
And by the emperor it delivered...with some minor flaws.

When the first trailer came out it hit most Space Marine fans as a huge surprise since nobody
ever expected a sequel to finally arrive myself included, but oh boy we can be all thankful that it did because it's a blast!

I will create a mini section for the 3 main parts of the game, which are the following: The story mode, the co-op operations and PvP.

Let's start with the campaign:
What is your craft? Death.

It's a little bit on the shorter side but it's quite a ride. I try to remain spoiler free , so you can experience it for yourselves.
The gameplay is a mix of the original space marine paired with the horde system with tyranids and it works wonder for this game.
In the early game, depending on the difficulty you picked might feel slightly weak, but:
1) It's required for a healthy gameplay progression (By the middle, you'll feel a lot more potent with the gear you have, and at the end you'll be straight overpowered with a certain weapon combo), and don't forget that tyranids can rip through Astartes especially Warriors.

There is also a surprise enemy later on, which most of you'll probably expect, but it managed to be something new, a faction we never seen in a 40K game before. A breath of fresh air, a welcome change, you'll see.

I'd recommend taking it slow on the ship and taking in the ambience and mini events that happen between missions, they are 40K perfected. The devs clearly had passion and care about the source material.

And the final level: You are going to love it if you like Warhammer. It starts on a high momentum and keeps going and going until the very end. The boardroom meeting about it must have been like: ""How much hype do you want during the last 2 hours?"" ""Yes.""

So yeah, the story mode is roughly 7-8 hours long depending on the difficulty you pick, but it's a ride you'll remember.



The bread and butter of the game for the devs, the mode they clearly have priority on and want to expand further during the first 4 seasons of the game.
It's a mix of Darktide (With the fixed missions that can randomise) , WWZ with it's progression system and horde mechanics, and Space Marine with it's gameplay loop.

Overally it's really solid and has longevity if you like that kind of stuff, you can upgrade your characters and wargear with branching paths, and it's really really fun especially with friends.

There are only a few downsides as of writing this:

1) Class locks. Understandable but you can matchmake with a certain class selected and get dropped into a match in progress where you are forced to switch or quit.
2) No option to host a public lobby on your own. That's allegedly getting changed ""soon"". We'll see.
3) Balance. The balance is fine for the most part, there is only one black sheep , the assault class. It's rather weak, or simply doesn't have it's proper plance among the 6 mainline classes. It needs some slight love.



Not much to say, it gives you vibes of a game that's from 2012...but that's a good thing. You have 3 modes, the classic domination mode, team deathmatch and king of the hill. The TTK (Time to kill) is fast as it should be, and the matches are really fast and fun.

Balance seems fine for the most part, i'v played a lot of matches, unlocked some relic armors and never felt like anything needs a nerf. Of course it's early to tell, we have to wait until the community unlocks everything and some time passes, but so far it's solid.

There is only one big negativity when it comes to pvp: The maps. Don't get me wrong, they are good but there are only 3 maps currently in the game. They are adding more later on, but you can't help but feel like there should have been at least a few more on release.

A short summary for the end:
🟩 Pros 🟥 Cons

-An amazing campaign mode, which makes 40k come alive -That is slightly on the shorter side
-A really fun, classic vibe PVP mode -That has little map variety
-The graphics are really nice and works well with the art design -Technical issues on some systems, i had no problems
-The coop mode is a blast especially with friends.
-It's a long awaited sequel to Space Marine 1 and it delivers

If you read through all that, i would like to thank you for taking your time to do so and have a nice day dear reader!
Also thank you for Saber interactive for making such a banger of a sequel!",2024/9/10,en

Welcome to Follow the NetEase UU Appreciation Training Plan
Follow the UU accelerator VX public account, reply ""Steam"", and get invitations to exclusive player groups.

In front
柄 This game is very suitable for the handle operation. The vibration adaptation of the handle is very good. Walking, fighting and other feedback are very good. The keys and mouse keys are too strange, and the game experience is much worse than the handle!
P Since the game opening requires EPIC verification, if you encounter a problem, you can try to solve it according to the following methods

1. Card EPIC service update: Close the game and Steam; open the EPIC acceleration of the accelerator; search for the EPIC process in the Windows task manager and turn it off; then open the Steam to check the integrity of the game; click to start the game, re -update the EPIC ONLINE ServiceEnter the game.
2. TheEPIC service update is still unable to play the game: enter the installation directory of the game, and directly start the ""Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2"" to enter the game.

The background of the game is closely linked to the grand background of the 40K of the Hammer. As a very aggressive and large number of alien creatures, Teron Zerg has damaged many planets of the human empire.The player played by the player as the Emperor's His Emperor's interstellar warrior shouldered the heavy responsibility of defending the empire and fighting with him!
The game shows the high industrial strength in the performance of the visual effect. Various science fiction effects in the Warhammer Universe have been performed in the game. As another work developed by the developer of ""Zombie World War""The corpse tide is once again applied to this game. The dense Terren worm tide gives the players who are nervous to oppression. The vast and magnificent battlefield visual interpretation is frequently interpreted, and it is self -integrated into the player's battle, giving the player a sense of coolness!

The game retains a very traditional linear level system in the gameplay. It has no decryption or too much exploration element. The combat and remote weapons can be used in combat.Needless to say, remote shooting, but the game has added a lot of action mechanisms in melee, allowing players to play better. When the enemy emits blue light, it can be blocked.It can be understood as a slow -moving high damage skill. When the enemy's health is low, it can trigger the execution and bring a strong visual effect of killing.
However, execution is not only as simple as ending the enemy, but also a way to encourage players to fight. In the game, players' armor and life are relatively crispy. Execution can quickly reply to the armor and provide a short invincible frame.Triggering a small part of AOE damage, it is difficult to shrink the output under such settings. Going to the face and insect hard steel is the best choice and one of the main sources of refreshing.

However, it does not mean that you can have a brainless face. When facing a lot of bugs, it is the most important thing to use rolling gear and AOE damage.Will disappear quickly!

The content of the battle of this game is not long. You can clear the level in 7-8 hours, and there are no other elements under the traditional level gameplay, so it is easyIt is reflected that the game is divided into PVP and PVE, which increases the fun of the game through slight development and teamwork. Six different occupations are available in PVE mode. Different occupations have different weapons and skills restrictions. For exampleIn the melee weapon, there is only one heavy Gatling with a shield skill, which is very suitable for making strong fire output in the rear.
In addition, the experience obtained in the bureau can improve the corresponding role and weapon level, can enhance weapons and character skills, and make the battle more refreshing. In the case of not much game content, such a slight development mechanism has become a good driving force for the game!
However, there are some problems in the current online, and often there will be matching the game. However, according to the known announcement, it has been fixed. The patch should be updated in the future. At present, you can collect the task and bring AI teammates to play!

Generally speaking, this is a good action shot. Even if you are not familiar with the war hammer universe, you can still play very well. In the mode of multiplayer, it will maintain long -term operations in the future, and the potential will be unlimited!",2024/9/5,zh-cn
userpig,1,95.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/userpig/,"Never cared much about Warhammer until this game showed me the error of my ways and made me cast away the heresy and fully embrace the Emperor's glorious light. No longer do I wander in the shadow of ignorance, for Space Marine 2 has torn asunder the veil that clouded my mortal sight.

With each righteous strike of the chainsword, I felt the will of the Emperor coursing through my veins. The xenos or the heretic—none can stand before the might of the Adeptus Astartes, and now I, too, feel the weight of that sacred duty upon my shoulders. Every battle is a prayer to His undying majesty, every victory a testament to the purity of the Emperor's cause.

In this game, I learned what it truly means to be a warrior of the Imperium: to purge the unclean without hesitation, to stand unwavering in the face of annihilation, and to know that failure is not an option, for failure would mean the death of mankind itself. This is no mere entertainment—this is an initiation into the sacred brotherhood of those who fight for the survival of the Imperium.

Space Marine 2 is not just a game—it is a revelation, a holy writ in digital form, and a reminder that we must be ever vigilant, ever faithful, and ever ready to cleanse the galaxy of those who would defy the Emperor's will.

Poss,1,26.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014929285/,"Summary
Campaign: <15 hours of loreful hack n slash fun.
PvE: Fun with friends, but undercooked, linear and clunky
PvP: Fun with friends, but bare bones and unbalanced

I recently replayed Space Marine 1, and the sequel is a much better game. The visuals, sound and feel are all spot on for a Space Marine fantasy. However, it doesn't quite achieve everything it sets out to, and its secondary modes fall short of other similar games.

Campaign
This is very much a 40k story, with writing reminiscent of a black library novel. That is both good and bad, with the over the top sclock, bravado, action and machismo you'd expect. The grim reality of the Imperium is acknowledged, but on the whole it leans closer to glorification than critique.

The gameplay is a continuation of the first game's mechanics and feel, with chainswords and plasma guns feeling suitably impactful. It is highly linear, without meaningful choice and very little exploration. Being combat oriented and straight to the point is very Astartes, but would have grown wearisome if the campaign were any longer. The scripted executions are similarly timed to stay interesting right up to the end of the campaign, but perhaps not much longer.

There are obvious missed opportunities here. Like the vehicle levels which have placeholder cutscenes but don't let you control them, or terrain destruction which happens all around you, but you can't actually change. its also quite short, at under ten hours if you race through, or perhaps 15 if you take your time and play the optional missions as they unlock.

Still, overall it is an enjoyable romp over a couple of days

This is the bulk of the end game replayability, and the customisation will please many tabletop fans. However it has some key limitations. It doesn't have the visual depth or gunplay of Darktide, nor the endless variety and replayability of Vermintide or Left for Dead. This is a much more linear experience where you replay the same maps over and over. You do get variety from the different classes and upgrades, but progression is largely cosmetic or minor stat buffs.

Beyond the limited number of maps, skills and enemies, there are also pretty limited number of weapons, with quite a few slots having only a single option. You're likely to get dozens of hours of fun here, but maybe not hundreds. The repetition of things like execution animations which started to show in the campaign will become very clear over repeated play throughs of these levels. There is a roadmap with more content, lets hope there is enough in the pipeline to keep the juices flowing.

This is a throwback to a different kind of multiplayer, back to the days of unreal tournament or halo at a LAN party. There is a very low time to kill, and strong reliance on team coordination. There are only three maps with three game modes, so the replayability here is again limited by content availability.

PvP will be fun to play at launch, and if you have a crew together, but may struggle to drag people away from the hero shooters and mobas of the world long term.


This is a fun and brutal distraction for a few dozen hours. For some it will be a realisation of their childhood fantasy, for others it will be a gateway into an addiction they didn't know they wanted. It is a great entry into the set of warhammer games, and a worthy sequel to a fun game. It won't revolutionise the industry, but it does show that going back to basics and delivering what the fans want is a sound strategy for a good time.",2024/9/9,en

You say he can't do it. The game of the game is indeed available. It is nothing more than adding the value of the value. The repair and supplementary can be saved. Given that the game is just released, the manufacturer is also a small workshop. I can only say that the future is available.It is not enough, the explosive model must have an explosive operation attitude, and the arrows to learn fat sharks must die.
I personally like this work very much. Small flaws are uncomfortable to stop this game's excellent expressiveness on the 40K background. The pleasure of being a super macho man in a strange pile is believed to be unable to refuse. Although there is only low difficulty now, it can be possibleDo so.
Now SM2 is placed in front of the stage, and the hammer is naturally carnival, such as me.But the most important thing is the game experience.

"Meat-King, The Ultimate",1,118.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968514473/,"""Blessed is the mind too small for doubt.”

Warhammer 40.000: Space Marine 2 (2024) represents a third-person hack-n-slash shooter game, developed by the company Saber Interactive and published by the company Focus Entertainment. The first instalment (2011) was developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ.



++ The campaign features the beginning of a Tyranid invasion, with all its horrors and endless tides of claws and teeth. Perfect setting for the grim dark future in which every melee execution results in a fountain of blood and guts. In the middle is our protagonist Demetrian Titus, who lets us see and experience the new story around him. That, dear reader, I consider the short-term motivation.

++ Now comes the long-term one, for the excellent integration of the cooperative modes allows us to play the campaign and secondary missions, called Operations, with up to two friends. Four difficulty levels in combination with six classes provide a broad spectrum of replayability. And for the brave, there is Eternal War mode, essentially a 6v6 PVP match that culminates in a battle between Space Marines and the Archenemy.

o What happened to the weight of the power armour? Each step of several hundred kilos of high-quality ceramite should leave an impact, yet the game does not convey the sounds or weight of it in a credible way. Just look at WH40K Boltgun for reference. What about the precision of ranged weaponry? Every time I fire several bolter shots the spread leaves me in disbelief. Any guardsman would severely doubt the marksmanship of that drunken angel of death standing next to him. What about crippling a Tyranid warrior? Unfortunately, not possible. A more detailed hit box with additional dismembering options would have been a great addition.

- Upon first launch of the game, an automatic installation of the Epic Online Services started. This constitues heresy of the highest order! The developers stated: „We can assure you that this was only implemented to support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores.“ Whatever the case, I immediately deinstalled it and the game runs just fine. And so should you, brother.

- A couple of bugs corrupted the holy binary code, e.g. floating items, delayed rendering of textures, clipping and collision issues. Saber Interactive’s tech priests have initiated counter protocols. The Omnissiah knows all, comprehends all.

-- I am shocked to witness the atrocities committed in front of my sacred codex. A simple Tyranid hormagaunt survives a bolter shot, and it takes a magazine to fell a warrior type. A fundamental misunderstanding of the technical background of the weapon. And I will not even start complaining about what they did to my dear melta and plasma weapons. Furthermore, there is a crippling imbalance between ranged and melee attacks, with the emphasis clearly on the latter. Just try to execute a warrior from 10 meters away, let me know how it went. The Inquisition has been informed of the devs’ transgressions; their punishment will be servitude in a penal legion against the greenskins on Armageddon.



The game nails the atmosphere of a Tyranid invasion, and the superb co-op gameplay allows for countless hours of playing the campaign with your battle brothers or prove your team’s tactical prowess in PVE and PVP sessions.

On the other hand, it displays some blatant lore inaccuracies and focuses more on close combat than on firearms, which completely undermines my attempts to crowd control the waves of biomass with ranged weapons. The Codex Astartes does not support this action!

Recommended for determined initiates and seasoned veterans, loyal to Roboute Guilliman, standing firm against the xenos filth in the darkest hours of the Imperium of Man.

The player does not care whether the production team has designed a self -moving shotgun (light machine gun) and heavy automatic shotgun (heavy machine gun), but the entire bomb weapon gunThe clan was marked with 'garbage'.

In the face of high difficulty, players will have to be forced to play hot -melt weapons.Who would have thought that the strongest cornerstone on the Empire and the vehicle, there was actually no combos of the combination in the game, and the enemy's defense posture could not be moved.Elite weird chicken ribs?

When the samurai puts a double bone knife and cuts me directly with the dense heavy explosion barrage, I wondered whether I took a heavy burst of the rifle, or the Carterrell laser gun in the Star Army.EssenceYou know, Baoya is a rocket ammunition made by Jingjin. Well gold is not as hard as the bone knife of samurai?Why doesn't it even break the defense posture?

In terms of firearm shooting feel, the 1 -inch heavy bomb design looks like the feel of the .75 burst. The .75 burst feel and the strikes were not even as good as the warhammer 40000: the dark tide thief with the mortal bombs of the army had a sense of strike.All players who come to explode the shotgun will be disappointed, because in this game, the long -range weapons of you and friends when playing, only hot -melt weapons with a very low bullet capacity can help you survive. Choosing explosive guns is choosing to chooseHe died of disappointing the emperor.

Later I would like to talk to the production team to talk about the design of the game mode.

Online PVE, why don't you design an open map, like the Jedi dive 2, smash us with a jumping airdrop compartment to specify the task goal for us, let us complete ourselves?This is not faster than you design linear map updates, more playable?

What classic design of Astart's five -person jumping cockpit, will the production team not allow players to experience track airborne at once?If there is no track airborne.Every time I took the Thunder Eagle Barn, I was an airborne soldier in Astart and even the Star Army.Astart, which has not experienced the crackdown on track airborne, is equipped with Astart?There is no spirit at all!",2024/9/9,zh-cn

TowardEson,0,41,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198364924021/,"First of all, if you are a player who watched to buy, then my suggestion is: Don't buy it, at least this is the case at this stage.
If you are a war hammer fan, I will recommend you to buy as appropriate, but if you are not a fans of war hammers at all, then repeat the first sentence.

In this game, I mainly play Jianwei (completely unlocked). In this version of this version, it is basically one of the clown, and I can only play as auxiliary.My evaluation is only based on the play experience of Jianwei.

So why don't I recommend buying?

In the beginning of the version, Jian Wei was undoubtedly a lot of sky, fighting back on brainless bombs, and it was really cool to provide teammates with blood recovery and resurrection services.
If the production team does not want to balance it, then I will recommend you to buy it.

First, the player's mobility is too bad.
Big Brother, this is Astart, not Ogrin, who is wearing heavy armor, you are running faster than the mortal in the game. Is this appropriate?The dark tide superman next door runs faster than your so -called Old E God.No matter which version, this is a problem that I have been talking about. Many big maps, you are not running fast, the only use is to use it on the way to run.Hongru, the bullet is full.

The second point is also the most important point. The production team is mentally retarded, especially in terms of balance.

Someone may spray, oh, it is obvious that you are too simple at first, and it is difficult to come.
He ordered the church, we want the strong to the strong, that is, three powerful Astarts to play the same strong sea of ​​battles, not you cut everyone into old, weak, sick and disabledCut with bugs.

There are too many places to change the disgusting people in terms of balance, here is one by one.

First, most of the actions of Jianwei can be canceled afterwards. Now it is gone. When you are doing thousands of children, you have to be careful to make a move. He is afraid that people can do not dry you directly for a red circle.

Second, the dodge of invincible frames shorten and the judgment of the attack is shortened. What do you change this B gadget? I ask?Do you think the player is so comfortable, right?Have you ever experienced the current game?Do you use one -third of your Orgarin's IQ to think about it, is this too supermodel?Yes, very supermodel, where is the supermodel?Because except for fighting back, all of them are waste!You can only flash against the unstoppable red circle!You can definitely flash one -on -one, what about the sea?You roll off the invincible frames, as long as you want to eat damage as soon as you roll, then I will also play a cow.

Third, when I talk about this back, I am angry. Do you know why everyone has no brain counterattack?It's because the melee damage you designed is really true!Very tm low!I cut 3 sets that it is better to play a high damage once, isn't it a buddy, are you gangsters who are gangsters to force and fear and abuse?Have you considered why players have formed these play?You can lay down to sleep at this cut. If you accidentally find you to find your teeth.

Fourth, you say a balanced, and the surface is adjusted. In fact, your bright and secret reforms are not known.The first three problems seem to be within your expectations, right?If you want to repeat the super earth, just say.
Take remote, my sword guard is really afraid of remote, especially when fighting, you can't hold the shield all the time?Do you can't stop the gun behind, right?You said that you have reduced the hit rate of bullets during melee, and what is the result?When I approached the enemy to play close -up war, your B monsters are unwilling to melee, just to shoot a gun with a face with a face, your TM orange predecessor is ""as long as this distance, you can’t escape it!"" YesThe hit rate is reduced. The hit rate on TM's face is not low. My TM full blood sword sword guard N5 was evaporated by a bug directly.Dao Lie Fire, what do you let me do?Give you a shield for you?Do you move that pig's mind, is this a balance that people can think of?

In summary, the balance of disgusting people and the almost failed designs caused by balance.

Also, your production capacity is low enough, the original god is 10,000 times higher than your production capacity.

I like this game very much. Astart is really handsome. Titus's story is also worthy of talked about it, but that's it.

Anyway, this game was great. Played the campaign partially solo and partially coop. Melee is very satisfying and fun. The shooting is also nice but usually feels pretty ineffective given the lower ammo capacity of most guns. The first moment of the game where you see a huge swarm running at you is terrifying but also exhilarating.

I will say the first half of the game was my favorite, as the other enemies later on don't seem quite as fun to fight, but it was still enjoyable. I never skipped a cutscene, as they were really drawing me in even with no knowledge of the universe. The world building, overall art direction and scenery is just impeccable, and I probably spent upwards of 30+ minutes just staring at the vistas.

Not without problems, we are waiting for the patch of the first day, but I have no moral right to put a negative review.

Everything is fine in it.To the smallest details.

The space marines are felt by the space marineer.This is not an ordinary blank, but a huge genetically modified man in a heavy MK armor.10, which moves a heavy but confident
The chain sword is felt exactly as you imagine it, reading books.Huge, crumbling everything in its path, spilling rivers of blood
The bolter shoots not with ordinary cartridges, but reactive, it is felt both in the return and in the impact.
The developers were literally able to make all the mechanics as they should be.The landing on the planet of tyranids is felt literally like in the book, only more colorful, lively, and you can wash xenos in the blood with your own hands.This is truly the best that I played this year (and maybe in general)

The photo is also excellent for the word, you can beautifully click the funny cut of tyranids and heretics.I liked it

Of the disadvantages, I would note a very dubious balance in PVP, the lack of photographer in the coop, and the fact that by the fifth hour of the continuous game my 4060 lost half the frames, and the percent decided to arrange heating.But the breasts promised a patch, we wait, I do not see the reason to dial

I still can’t comprehensively express all the emotions from the game, but I can definitely say - passing on the complexity of the Death Angel is not just better than intercourse, these are the most vivid emotions in my life

Mischief,1,145.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Travesura/,"TL;DR? Yes, I recommend this game, it's simple old school fun, some caveats here and there, regarding multiplayer, some epic shenanigans and, maybe replayability.
But if you want to have fun, it delivers.

I played the first Space Marine years ago, not when it was relaced but a few years ago, and I had fun. This game feels like coming back to that Xbox 360 era, of ""simpler"" games, you just want to burn some time, doing some bombastic and silly violence, it's perfect doing that.
You got a decent and fun to play campaign that can be played on coop with friends, (I recommend because the bots kinda suck), operations that complement the campaign, they are coop missions where you unluck experience and cosmetics, and a PVP mode.


The biggest pro's of this game, in my opinion are the gameplay, just raw fun, it can feel repetitive but, it feels so good that honestly I don't care. It can be punishing in harder difficulties but if you master the dodge and parry system you become an unstoppable killing machine.
The visuals and presentation are spectacular, from the first to the last minutes, I stopped several times to admire the work of the devs bringing to life the 40K universe, and Kudos to Saber, they did a great job. Not just representing the dark and grim aesthetic, the technical spectacle of seeing thousand of enemies on screen, the colors, particles, explosions, textures, blood. Delightful, I can say the same about the sound design and music as well.
The story is there, it's not going to blow your mind but hey, it isn't bad at all. It's a good conduct to the slaughter gameplay.

The weak points of the package, imo of course, are... maybe some optimization, lack of graphic options (ahem, FOV slider), Epic anti cheat and online services, these are kinda silly though, you can uninstall the online services if you don't want to use crossplay, and the anti cheat, well... sadly, a lot of games uses that crap, at least we don't have denuvo, thanks devs. I didn't suffer any crashes of super bad drop of performance even if my pc has some weird specs.
The gameplay can feel imprecise at some points, I'm speaking about parrying some attacks, dodging, besides of repetitive, as I said, I don't mind this, because I just enjoy how fun it is anyway.
The length of the whole package, I am happy with it but, maybe some people is expecting more content, if you see the roadmap there will be more content in the future but this isn't a life service game (thanks lord Emperor) so don't expect seasonal huge updates. Let's see how the devs manage the dlc content, I think it will be all just cosmetics but we will see...

Overall, I enjoyed this game, I had my doubts honestly, the first trailers looked too good, and after playing I can say Saber delivered a good game and a great sequel.
Thank you, after so many fiascos lately it's nice and refreshing to play a game that it's just fun, faithful to the source, made with care and dedication.

Godbrithil,1,21.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Godbrithil/,"After over a decade of anticipation, countless prayers and occasional cursing, Titus has finally put on his iconic armor again-ready to make alien hordes out.But the question remains: Is it the long -awaited triumph that we have been waiting for?Or just another digitized bloodbath without brain and heart?We snapped St. Bolter and plunged into the battle.


As soon as you started the game, there is no time for gentle introduction or profound philosophical conversations.Instead, you get a thick bolt in your hand and are thrown into an army of Tyranids.The hero of our history, Captain Titus, is the epitome of the Space Marine cliché: indestructible, cynical and with the moral empathy of a chain sword.Not long is torched here - as if a bulldozer drives against a horde of anger - ruthless, tremendous and 100% satisfactory.The feeling when your chain sword drives into a group of aliens is pure balm for which soul strained by everyday life.Strategic depth?Forget it!You are not a chess master, you are a war instrument, and your only tactic is: destroy everything in sight.The small subtle introduction is by no means too short or later.


The story of Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 is as epic and profound as a motivational poster in an office: it is there, but actually none is interested.Captain Titus returns, and with him the old wisdom that words may be powerful, but cannot do anything against a well-placed Bolter Salve.The tyranids eat whole worlds, the imperator is silent as always, and Titus does what he can best do: smash everything that does not look imperial or Xenos.Deep character development?None.But there is a lot on the twelve - and frankly, that's exactly the kind of storytelling that we deserve.For everything else, there is the books.[/H1]


What could be nicer than shooting a Horde Xenos into pieces?Exactly - to do the whole thing with friends.Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 provides us with a Coop mode that does not swing big speeches, but throws you and your buddies directly into the battle.This is not about sophisticated tactics or clever interaction - it's about who is the first to ""for the imperator!""Shouts while he ballet his bolter.Fun aside: With two wisen friends or randoms, you rush into missions that are designed to promote teamwork - at least in this respect that you will revive each other when one of the comrades in the heat of the moment blesses the time.My personal recommendation: plays the Coop on the level of difficulty ""Angel of Death"" (campaign) or ""merciless"" (PVE), because only there does the real fun and the brutal authenticity of the shared slaughter come into its own.


Not a shameless cash shop that wants to pull your money out of your pocket while you are dismantling aliens.Space Marine 2 dispenses with microtransactions, booster or any payment models that give you the feeling that you only take part in the battlefield if you do not make a lot of coal.There is only one thing to do here: killing and celebrating victories.












Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 is not for delicacies.It is a game that does not indulge in any illusions and instead offers you exactly what it promises: merciless, brutal and, above all, entertaining destruction.It is as if someone had thrown Doom, Gears of War and the dark 40k world into a blender and accidentally pressed the button for ""epic"".So if you are looking for a game that you don't have to think about, but just want to sow death and ruin - welcome.But do not forget to call ""lead the imperator"".

During the first mission Captain Titus is ordered to carry a bomb to be launched into the atmosphere to kill all the Tyranids on the planet, but when he fails and is about to die he is demoted to Lieutenant for alleged corruption.
After being operated on he is reassigned back to the battalion, but as a Lieutenant and during this adventure he will be with his new companions Chairon and Gadriel who will accompany him on all the missions.

Mabi[N]ogi。,1,35.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MABINOGI_Reborn/,"Let's talk about the conclusion first. At present, passers -by are not recommended. The battle experience is qualified, but the current content is not worth buying at full price. The online PVE and PVP experience are not good.

1. level
The battle performance is great, and the big scenes are particularly shocking. Each monster has at least three types of execution actions. Macro mobs, tearing elite's refreshing refreshing is currently the only one, but it is limited to low difficulty. Once the difficulty is increased, the difficulty is increased.In the future, the underlying movement design and the level of monsters with ""bombing against, dodge"" will give you a shit experience. The monster refresh is not logical, the number is large, and it is from all directions. There is no safe area. There is no safe area.There are very few bunkers. You can even go through the wall to shoot you from all directions. You can even wear a wall to shoot you (probably BUG). You are difficult to clean up them with low -performance long -range remote weapons and prone to bottoming ammunition.The toughness is very poor, and the power of the thunder hammer will be punching and flying, not to mention the multiple elite melee monsters mixed in the miscellaneous soldiers make you hardly finish a complete melee companyAlmost endlessly, the task goal of ""saving antenna"" in the tide is endless. If you bring two NPCs that can't do things, you are even more painful.
In addition, the battle will not give any rewards, and only a few cooperation levels will be unlocked, which makes it no heavy value for players.The latter levels of the cooperation level are very disgusting, resulting in almost only the first two levels of the online PVE, the 12 pictures that were originally made, only 2 or even 1 by players chose to play repeatedly. Players can only choose to choose for efficiency to choose for efficiency.I choose one in the boring and eat shit for freshness.

It is not so unbalanced, it is a poor performance of melee and long -range weapons as a whole. It does not match the number and strength of monsters. The positioning of firearms is close to the rifle submachine gun of ordinary shooting games.Canned samurai, chaotic Gatling rockets will also have canned dog tough dogs. In the face of them, you have almost no effective counter -counter on the offensive end.It seems that the multiple elites to death seem to be the hot melting gun, and the shotgun can not even make any hard straight to the elite.In the melee, there are higher technical level requirements, but the upper limit is lower.
The above reasons lead to the difficulty of medium high, that is, in the PVE that starts from difficulty 2, the player's choice is very limited. In addition to the hot melting gun, the high -damage and the grenades are poured to death.It is completely absent from melee.

The current development system is very simple, PVE output:
① Vocational experience → Upgrade, order professional talent
② Weapon experience → Weapon upgrades, upgrade needs → Give the talent of weapon after proficiency
③ Weapon data → Used for weapon upgrades, hard bundling with difficulty, can also be used to directly proficient in the weapon you don’t want to practice
④ Currency → Point professional talent, buy weapons, and buy coat -pairing armor accessories all need
It can be found that in addition to experience and currency, the only special props produced is weapon data, and the weapon data will soon overflow. One type of weapon is needed.bored.The output of all levels is almost the same, which also makes players only choose 1-2 easiest levels to swipe.Of course, I don't think it is a good design to swipe the entry, but it does lack diversity.
The only development of PVP is to get the battle experience to unlock the battle level, so as to unlock the types of weapons that can be configured in each profession.

The design of the PVP battle itself can only be said to be ""general"", which is a very ordinary shooting battle, and the biggest feature system of this game is invisible in PVP.
The most important problem with PVP is:
① No system!
Except for the game, there are no systems, no rankings, no competition systems, and matching all relying on fate. Only the player level and professional level accumulated according to experience will show you.
② Cheating!
The production team is almost lying flat for anti -cheating. Except for a small blue bear that does not have any effect on cheating, there are no measures!Not even the report button!I even doubt that the production team will not be processed. Even if you are infinitely thunderous, you will be disgusting in the PVP of this picture. Especially after the unlocking of No. 10, you will be seen.After the hybrids who came to China to travel across the second, everyone was honest.Who would have thought that ten of the dozen of the cheating beasts are all foreign friends who have taught Chinese.

In addition to the transition kit with a little detail in the middle, there are only 2 sets of appearance in each occupation, which are unlocked according to the field. In addition, there are very few appearances that can be unlocked.Basically reflected in color matching.

In terms of my personal configuration, there is no problem optimizing, and the game of the same level screen is difficult to find better than this game. I need to adjust the settings separately to not card.The number of frames outside the maximum pulk is stable, and the difference between the thirty or forty frames of the leakage engineering version is very obvious.
There are many small problems, including but not limited to:
Select the secondary display by default. After the settings are settled, he will give you the default selection of the secondary display, but the display in the settings 1 and 2 is replaced;
The first day of PVE cannot be loaded into the server, but the next day is repaired;
Sometimes hitting will cause the characters to be stuck in the character. After a few seconds, it must be rolled to be rolled and so on ...

Overall, the quality of this game is qualified and I like it very much, and although there are many problems, most of the problems can greatly optimize the experience. The PVE and PVP systems need to be changed.Don't want to play this PVP.The gap in the production capacity of art is very large. It requires new maps, new levels, new monsters, and a large number of new custom armor, otherwise there will be only grades to brush.Therefore, this game does not recommend the current full price purchase. If you only fight the battle, you can experience the process but only less than ten hours. If you want to play high difficulty, you need to understand and practice.

Warhammer IP is a Warhammer Total War, which has been shown as a fantasy worldview compared to the IP name value and fandom size, and in the 40K worldview, the Dunge of War series was once successful, and it is an IP that is steadily mentioned in the game -related suffering.

As a result, the problem -related issues of the Games Workshop (typically only nuggle from the dark tide)
It was a speculation that is quite often mentioned abroad that it is involved in game development in relation to miniature sales.

Because of that reason, major game companies are reluctant to use the IP
Complex that is overflowing with steam ~ In the midst of a mass production of positive games

It was more concerned than expected when Saber Interactive, who had been evaluated for the development of the game itself with World War Z itself, was considered to be inadequate, and the fact that the post -support and operational ability was good.
The main story of World War Z had a lot of technical issues at the time of launch, and there was no longer than I thought because the content was small before the update was added.

Some of these problems are still in this Space Marine 2, but nevertheless dopamine elements that can overcome this regret are significant in the game.


1. Action production that suits the space marine

The crew has been steadily mentioned since its release that it was inspired by the Gears of War series, and it is actually a cruel and pleasant production and play method that is actually seen in the Gears of War series.This is well matched with Space Marine's character, and it is also suitable for the Warhammer 40K worldview.
In the case of the previous work, the character was so heavy except when using some jump packs, but this time I feel that I have a good feeling that it is a heavy and living weapon.

2. Visual

Unlike the previous one, Space Marine, which was too monotonous, it showed a wider range of backgrounds, providing fun to watch the background all the time, and the design of the Warhammer 40K fans, the design, art style, and the quantity of the world War ZIs excellent overall.
However, the performance is a bit unfortunate.

3. Operation expected in the long run

In the case of the previous World War Z, the main story has been pointed out a lot of problems, but this problem has been improved quite a bit with continuous follow -up, and this Space Marine 2 will be updated for PVE mode, map, and PvP in the long term in the long term.Scheduled.
If they maintain only the post -support they showed in the previous work, they will have a good impact on the long -term life of the game.

4. PVP, which is quite expected

I was able to beta in PvP, so I was smashed even if I was expecting PVP from overseas, but it was surprisingly chosen.It feels a bit different from Arena, Counter Strike, and Valorant, represented by Call of Duty, which is currently occupying the FPS game market.It feels like.The metaro so far is to die if you try to run and gun with ignorance, and it is believed that the team members gather together with 6 vs 6 confrontation depending on the position.However, it is not a feeling that the balance itself is made so much that it is not enough to go in the long run, apart from the nucleus.

5. Lack of current content and mission diversity

However, the disadvantage of the critics' evaluation and the disadvantage of the people who enjoy the absolute content itself is a little less.
The campaign itself has a variation depending on the difficulty level, but you can see the ending for 8 to 12 hours, and only six maps are the main PVE content.And the Horde mode and additional PVE content are scheduled to be updated later, so if the PVE Pai Youth layer, which has been bursting with Helgers 2, is looking for a game that can be replaced, it can be a little disappointed with the lack of content.There are few elements of PVE games and digging, but there are no elements to analyze and challenge except for the difficulty levels.

6. A technical issue that is quietly experienced

The AI ​​is a bit copper, and you can find a bug quite easily when you play, and there are many cases of delay in PvP or PVE if the server is unstable.


Overall, there is still a disadvantage of developers, lack of main contents, and technical issues
If you think about the post -support that the developer showed in the previous World War Z, it appears to be a long game.
IP accurately knows what IP is, and in this part, the overall design and design of the game is well established
Unlike the B ~ C -class Warhammer game, which was mass -produced in various genres in that it offset the shortcomings.
I feel that I was selected well.

Warhammer, a fan of Gears of War Series

If you are out of the Warhammer or Gears of War series,
If you are a user who enjoys the PVE genre lightly, you can buy it as a sale price.",2024/9/10,ko

EPIC online problem

This game also adopts the form of the luxury version of the first experience. First, it means that loyalty also takes the test first, and first experience the BUG, ​​but when the EPIC online service appears at the beginning of the game, it really makes me worry aboutTo stop me, it is more about the launch.But I believe that many good brothers are still troubled by EPIC service updates, and provide two solutions to everyone.
1. Card EPIC service update: Close the game and Steam; open the EPIC acceleration of the accelerator; search for the EPIC process in the Windows task manager and turn it off all: then open Steam to check the integrity of the game; click the game, re -update the EPIC Online ServiceEnter the game.
2. EPIC service update is still unable to play the game: enter the installation directory of the game, directly start the ""Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2"" to enter the game.
The play experience in the game stand -alone is not excellent. AI teammates are miserable, and the enemy will gather fire to you. It is still difficult to be difficult for single people to play.It is best to find a friend to play together. You can try the UU accelerator connection. Not only can you help solve the problem of entering the game, but you can also escort your archive with cloud storage file service.

The main line of the main line plot battle mode is short, and the main line plot can be completed in a dozen hours under normal difficulty.In the main storyline, the player will play the deputy officer of the return to the extreme soldier queue, De Mitrian Tatuz, lead the three teams to charge, complete the unlikely task, express the loyalty to the emperor, wash his suspicion of his suspicionWin glory.The plot of the game is very good. It is very pure linear plot. It is very restored. There are no many riddles. It is very clear. Instantly, pure passers -by can get a good experience. I believe that the series fans can experience it.It is even more orgasm, and there are a large number of eggs in the original book in the game.Not to mention that this game has a Chinese character in the middle, and the effect of the middle match is also very good. With the battle of grand epic, how can it be a cool word?
In addition to the main storyline of the battle mode, this game also has the PVE action mode of six maps, as well as several PVP modes, including classic models such as team death and point.To be honest, the content of the game is not too much.

The weapons that players can use in the game include a main weapon, a pistol and a melee weapon. Of course, with the changes in the changes in the military mode and the PVP, the types of weapons can be different.The main encouragement of the attack is melee. Holding a series of weapons such as a chain sawing sword to tear the enemy to smash the enemy.And this is also the case in the battle. The ammunition of the long -range weapons in the hands of the player has received serious restrictions. For ordinary enemies, the long -range weapons can be slightly responded, but when facing a slightly stronger elite soldier, the melee looks extraordinarily particularly extra combatIt is important that melee attacks can not only cause damage in a large scale, but also cause a blow to larger enemies. It is also convenient for a series of operations such as elite enemies.The melee attack of the enemy is roughly divided into three forms. There is no prompt attack, a faster blue attack, and the non -defensive red attack. The blue attack can cause hard straight and damage by blocking.Executive.The elite monster will lose one -third of the blood volume. The blood volume of the elite monster in the game is usually expressed in three grids. The three grids can be executed, and the execution will restore the three -grid shield.The big head of the player's harm also revolves around the shield. The enemy is executed in the melee to obtain the shield to achieve the cycle in the battle. The limited long -range bullet also causes the player to get greater returns with close combat.
However, it should be said that although the game encourages melee, there will be a lot of long -range enemies if the plot is single.Firepower, the enemy will only gather you fire. If the output space is very small and if you fight positively, you need to pay attention to a large number of other mobs and elite monsters around the surrounding areas., I may have been busy for a long time.In particular, it is difficult to fight high, and it has nothing to do with Shuangyou, and the means that players can choose are more limited.

In the game, the single and multi -person parts in the game are two different development solutions. The main line plot basically does not develop a system, and some only use the plot to promote unlocked weapons and so on.The online part uses a large number of liver experience to further unlock new -level weapons to enhance the character level, so as to obtain some passive skills to form Build.The content of this part seems to be boring. After all, there are not many maps of the game. Repeating liver is indeed annoying.However, less content is more solid in the game content, the game feels solid, the firearms are well -designed, and the production of knife cut meat is bloody, and the basic content is solid at least for a period of time.",2024/9/10,zh-cn

He requested a return to Ultramarine, but was ignored.

・ Codex Astartes
Space Marine's engagement rules that are sometimes translated as ""Scriptures of Battle"".
The content is just a manual that can be referred to during engagement, such as military organization and tactics,
It's been more than 10,000 years since this was made, and it would be like a Bible.
It feels like a rule that you can't go unless you protect the space marine in this world

One of the reasons why Titas was accused of heresy in the game is
It is also a big deal to act flexibly without obeying this Astaltes.
When I suggested to escape from the falling airplane in the main story with a jump pack
There is a scene that protests, ""It's not in Astaltes!""
In other words, if you do something that is not written in Astaltes, this world may be informative hearing.

・ Astartes, Adeptus Astartes
Please note (although it is one of the factors that complicate W40K)
In fact, Astaltes has another meaning.
Sometimes when I say Astaltes, it sometimes means Adeptus Astaltes,
This means Space Marine itself.There is no choice but to interpret it by context.

・ Death watch
An alien specialized unit.Perform the most dangerous mission to fight on the front line.
There are many cases that are sent as punishment.
Anyway, the harsh and famous

・ Black shield
There is a sentence on the shoulder of Space Marine to display your hometown and status,

Coming from someone who has little to no Warhammer 40k knowledge or experience, I had an awesome time playing through the story and operations in Space Marine 2! I just obtained all achievements after finishing the game this weekend in the early access launch period, and I’m glad to finally have this one done after grinding xp and kills for hours on hours. Space Marine 2 has pretty much three different branches of content; the Main Story Campaign, Operations (PvE), and Eternal War Mode (PvP). For me personally, the campaign was good…not bad but not great. Eternal War has potential but there isn’t a whole lot of variety with 3 maps and 3 game modes at launch….I know in the roadmap there is more planned which is great! The Operations were the highlight of my time with the game. Character customization and class progression feels killer, and I really liked the different difficulties. Visually the game looks amazing, performance wise I did have a few crashes/freezes and some connection issues when connecting to others. Crossplay worked decent during the campaign and operations, but I really wish there was a way to turn on/off cross-play in PvP since I’d love to team up with my brother who plays on his PS5. Overall, the hunt for the grindy achievements like maxing out a class or killing 41k enemies was what fueled my desire to complete this game and it feels great to add this one to the list!

The loading time is outrageous, start the game, take a bath, feed a cat, listen to the song, maybe it is still loading game resources.But as long as you do n’t retreat, you can still accept it.
In the plot, you are straightforward and the elder brother is a superman. You cut, you shoot, you presented the throne;

In the task, there is no essential difference between you and the big soldiers in the plot. The logic of the monster refresh is almost terrible. I have encountered sporadic encounter from beginning to end.There are 20 sniper insects, and you can hold you on both ends. You can't take care of yourself when you hit your life.
The difficulty curve is very fascinating, and the basics of most collected versions are stuck in the second -order weapon.The third-level precision worker must be difficult to fight 3, the small caterpillar burst shotgun requires 4-5 guns, and you only have 180 rounds, and you can't find the supply, because this is also part of the difficulty.

In the past three days, many Chinese and foreign hammer powder teams have passed the team. Many of the sacred armor, holding the knife and rotten guns, everyone smiled at each other.
You have no advanced weapons, you can't beat it; you can't fight, so you can't get advanced weapons.closed loop.

Many things are not sincere, and many things beyond the technical level forcibly join.I hope it will be repaired in the future.

g_divergence,1,11.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gdiverge/,"What can I say... (Edit: A lot apparently)

From the campaign alone I think it was a solid buy.

The combat isn't mind-blowing DMC5/MGSR melee combat action awesomeness, and the shooting isn't quite as tight as more focused cover style shooters, but - and this is a big BUT - you feel like a space marine. How is that not cool?! You're a little slow, a little heavy, but you feel like a 10 foot tall dump truck ready to steamroll anything that isn't painted blue. The weapons don't have a massive amount of variety, but on some reflection, I think its acceptable. Would I have liked to see some of the more insane bits of kit for use? Sure, but that isn't really the ""I am a tactical marine that branches out a bit sometimes"" vibe that Titus gives off. (I would still kill for a terminator armor mission, to be clear.)

As far as the breadth of content goes, it took me just over 9 hours to beat the campaign on veteran, and I plan on going for max difficulty here in the near future. Was it a riveting story? No, not really. But it was good. It feels *authentic* in a way that was refreshing, like I could open just about any 40k book and find something like this in its pages. The story I think actually does itself a disservice in some ways where certain elements are underplayed or resolved a bit too quickly, but still, it had all of the beats it needed to, and a more than appropriate amount of justice to the setting to sell me on this being the actual 40k universe.

Some will see the 9 hour campaign and see that as a deal breaker. If you play on game-journalist difficulty and don't do anything but sprint from checkpoint to checkpoint, I wouldn't be surprised if you could get it as low as 7 hours. For some, 10 bucks an hour is a bad ROI, and if you don't have *any* interest in playing the PvE or PvP, then maybe that's all you'll get out of the game. But hear me out. We are often spoiled with sprawling massive games that suck you in for 100+ hours, and this isn't that. Instead, you get a meticulously, fairly challenging, hand crafted experience with what is perhaps one of the greatest fictional universes ever. That has to be worth *something* even if it means ""I'll definitely get it on sale""

To sum up:

If you are a fan of 40k or just like 3rd person action games, its an easy buy.

The only reason I would say to steer clear for now is if you expect nothing less than Elden Ring: Space Marine edition in the content department for your hard earned bucks (which, fair enough if that's you).

I look forward to grinding through the PvE content over the next week or so, and will probably even dabble in the PvP to check it out as the game gets updated over the next year, and perhaps even beyond!

ViMartian,1,12.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086840425/,"At first glance, in Space Marin 2 there is nothing innovative, uncomplicated gameplay, mechanics, as in many games before, a simple plot, corridor of locations, scarcity in the choice of weapons.
However, when I started playing, I experienced indescribable emotions.
The game has gorgeous to goosebumps with Gothic surroundings and gigantism, the elaboration of small details, spectacular battles.
The game managed to convey the amazing atmosphere of the universe, the state of the eternal struggle, a nagging sense of hopelessness, when you see the roller gigantic waves of enemies, but at the same time the stamina of the cosmodesters, the courage of the imperial guard and the overcoming of all difficulties.
It turned out that now it was precisely the following: a short -term plot campaign does not have time to get bored, corridor Loki concentrates on missions, fights the battles, and a simple plot gives rest from the variables of the variable endings of some games.It turned out that a large selection of weapons, in fact, is not needed, a cosmessor with a bolt screw and a chain sword-this is organic and quite enough)
As a result, the Space of Marina2 impressed me with their atmosphere that I became interested in the history of Wahi and began to read books in the universe.
I recommend this game, because, perhaps, someone else it will inspire me for immersion in the ENT of the world Varhammer 40k.

And yes, now I know all the primarchs by heart ...)))",2024/10/8,ru

Well, having completed the story mode, cooperative mode and thrown PVP I can say that the game is cream, it is the top that has to reach a game of Warhammer 40k, without despising others that do very good work worse even is jewelExempt from failures.Let's start:


GRAPHICS AND OPTIMIZATION: 10/10
If I like something of Focus, it is that the studies they have work very well in the games, that is, this game with a 2080 move it in ultra and do not fall at any time of 60 fps, everything they taught is, nothing of nothingDowngrades.

Difficulty: 3/10
I do not know what they have done to the game in this aspect apart from being designed to play with friends, it is that when playing in coop and history mode they have gone a lot with enemies that can make you instant kill, which is worth having to have toBeing challenging but it is a game that you are surrounded by enemies, there is no way to do it tactically, but if you play it in normal mode, they also give you tremendous unde.lower and that is recommended and has nothing to do with the level of your character.

History mode: 7/10
Well, the story without spoilers is a very good successor of the one giving depth to the characters and the world itself but with perhaps lore errors that are very caught with tweezers, but within what fits, very good

COOP mode 8/10
It is the other part of the story mode campaign and like the story mode you can play it alone or with friends, it has nothing beyond

Personalization: 9/10
Here it seems that they have heard the community because the improvement is brutal, being able to independently each part of the Astartes, and with a detail that the colors are the colors of GW, on the other hand, the bad, that everything is blocked everything and thatPart are DLCS, besides that the worst thing is that heretics do not let you just customize it, something that seems amazing, I hope that in the future they change it.

Multi mode: 8/10

This has nothing beyond what was in 1, same ways, in the future there will be survival mode (exterminatus) and there is nothing more remarkable than the levels you raise here and what unlocks is not set with the coop mode, and it is upset because there is much, too much to unlock and does not give so much the game

Final note 8/10
A worthy successor of Space Marine 1 with what one expects from the sequel, improvements, more bleeding and death, and with brutal moments, very well achieved",2024/9/8,es
AnFbiAgent,1,93.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1supersecretagentman1/,"I think the game is great, but has a lot of design flaws that can definitely be fixed in a couple months if the devs are paying attention. I understand they had people to please by releasing it this early, but it could've used more time in the oven, as a bad launch can really sour a game's reputation (looking at you Darktide). I'd like to get my grievances out of the way before I name the positives.

Firstly, requiring internet and server connection for a game like this feels strange, and the enemies are definitely tied to the servers as they lag around if the connection is acting up. And not having some basic matchmaking functionality is very strange on release. You can't choose lobbies, you can't choose to host or join them, and you can't opt for a solo run; even worse, there is ZERO reconnecting to a match if you aren't playing w friends. If you get disconnected due to their server mishaps during a quick match, you lose your potential 30 minutes of progress. And on top of that, there is no kick prevention late into a match, so if you really wanted to kick at the very end, you could.

Second, it has terrible optimization all round; it loads horribly slow without an SSD, I have it on an NVME and it still loads slow sometimes. Performance feels really really low for a lot of systems that should run it at a steady 60 FPS no matter what. I have a 4060 ti and it definitely doesn't keep 60 FPS, it routinely drops to 40, not to mention any mid-range systems that can barely run the game in certain scenarios.

Third, is the combat system. It ALMOST feels good. Small enemies tear you up way more than they should ever, armor sustain feels weird in it's current implementation, and so does HP sustain. The whole bloodborne rally mechanic is fine, but there is almost no way to sustain HP outside of the overheal bug, and Apothecary/Bulwark's ultimate ability, 99% of the lobbies I queue on Ruthless difficulty do exactly that because of the current balance. You should get a 5% heal for majoris executions and 10% for extremis, and like 15-20% for terminus. That and the loadout drop pods should heal you to some degree. Armor should have to chipped away by small enemies, it should not be that tyranid warriors are less scary than a group of hormagaunts or shield tzaangors. And we should be able to animation cancel into a dodge roll from any animation, at reasonable frames, as well as cancel into a parry on certain animations. Parry into dodge roll should feel fluid too. being locked into things feels pretty awful sometimes.

The good stuff here has serious potential. The combat when it DOES work, feels awesome. There is a flow state you can find yourself in if the game is really working with you. The inspiration from other games really works with the way they constructed the game (save the dodge roll. Astartes would not GoW dodge roll, the Bulwark side step looks apt though), Between the Doom executions, the Gears of War combat style, and the spawn waves akin to the Tide games (elites, mini bosses, specials, chaff units. Which itself is inspired by the slightly more basic Left for Dead formula) they have something truly addicting with how it handles skill expression and SOMETIMES, difficulty. I like this game, but I would love it if they made some seemingly easy changes. They have the framework up already, so if they really care about their players, they'd make some number changes. Combat is a super easy fix. Matchmaking too. The optimization might take them longer.

Overall, get this game if you think it looks fun, but only if you have decent internet, and an mid to high end PC.",2024/9/16,en

In general, there are not many good games, but Space Marine 2 is not just an example of a good game in the universe, this is an example of a game where people who standing are real fanatics who rummage for memes, for the ENT.They rummage about how to make sure that you can not tear yourself away from the screen to the titers.They shouted from Epic, imbued with characters, and at the end they simply looked at the titers under a damn steep soundtrack in ecstasy, and let the mean ultramarine tear that the adventure of Titus ended (or not?)).

As a 40K enthusiast, it is not recommended by hammer powder.
=======================================================
1. The biggest advantage: the plot battle experience is quite good.
The details of the fighting and logistics scenes are particularly sufficient, and the sense of presence of the 40K war is very good.
The NPC dialogue is rich and delicate, and the character image is clear, like a TV series with an immersive experience.

2. Main disadvantages: Compared with pricing, the content of content is still less, only 10 hours.
The main line battle content is only 10 hours.After the completion, there are many online PVEs (branch plot, while talking about the main line plot, what other teams are doing). At present, there are only 6 tasks.Then there are PVP, which can be ignored by poor balance.

For more than ten hours of content for this price game, the volume is too small.(As a comparison, the recently priced black myth Goku is enough for 60 hours)


The combat mechanism determines that this game is not a relaxed and happy tour, but that it needs to keep the fast-paced block/dodge-pistol headshot counterattack-execution cycle.

Most of the melee weapons are not fast, and it is not easy to cancel after the movement.Therefore, it is often easy to be beaten by active attacks at high difficulty, and only a small amount of movement is practical.Remote weapons are mediocre other than hot melt (sniper are only suitable for a small number of elite monsters, and ammunition is very limited).The blocking-execution can quickly restore armor and clear the miscellaneous soldiers, and the income is very high.

Welcome to Follow the NetEase UU Appreciation Training Plan
Pay attention to the NetEase UU connoisseur and start a wonderful game journey.

Honor is my life!
The game style of the game is as 40K as ever, and the scenes everywhere are full of dark retro Gothic style. Among them, there are some classical and magical high -tech.To the huge worldview, the collision of realism and futurism is the ultimate harmonious fusion. Maybe this is one of the keys to the war hammer 40K that has been standing and derived!The entire game process can always give us a bunch of new visual shocks. Under the premise of the visual effect setting to the highest premise, it is not an exaggeration to say that step by step is!

The game has Chinese dubbing throughout the game. Even the supporting role and passersby on the roadside, A, Bing Ding, will jump out from time to time to make the game feel immersive!Especially during the fighting process, the soldiers faced the almost unsatisfactory wave tide used in all directions. Everyone still shouted ""For the Emperor!""The fearing atmosphere of the battlefield is absolutely absolutely!

The game started at the planet under the control of the Empire in the alien Alien Toron Zerg, and the Star Fighter killing the team to lead the team.Sri Lanka did not die, so the mission of saving the planet can naturally only be undertaken by us!The only one who can accompany us is the opening of a chain sawing sword and the explosive guns picked up on the road!In this novice tutorial that allows the novice to die N times, after some struggle, in the end, after successfully launching a poisonous gas bomb to the flat flow layer, the unsatisfactory alien and its BOSS were surrounded.At the time of life, the rescue finally arrived!When we woke up again, the protagonist we manipulated had been transformed into a great and powerful original Star Warrior!The more dangerous legendary battle opened the curtain!Everything is ""For the Emperor!""

As the most powerful original Star Warrior of the Empire, the empire equipped us with ten explosive guns with different performance power in the weapon library, three empire -style pistols that can be used with melee weapons, and four powerful power.Melee weapons to ensure that we can win every time we go out!Different styles have their own attack mechanisms and attack effects. We need to choose the equipment for ourselves before the war!

The battle process of the game is simply bloody. In the face of the tide of uncomfortable alien worm, countless groups of turbulent rushing comes, whether it is using the burst of vermiculite guns in the hand for various long -range fire spray covers, andOr hold the chain saw the sword and shout ""For the Emperor!"", And then rush into the wave of insects to harvest a wave of blood!With the teammates fighting around, it feels that it will really make people forget the fear!Maybe this is the power of faith and comrades in the legend?

Of course, excitement and excitement, if you can't keep up with this strength, multiple tasks failure will be frustrated!Although we have become the most elite original Star Warrior of the Empire, and holding the most powerful weapons of the Empire, there are also legends: ""As long as it is carbon -based creatureThe wave tide is really too much too dense!In the process of passion Peng Bai's battle, a grenade will throw in a bunch of scenes in the market, and there will be a set of battle to fly a bunch of battles, but the friends who have a deeper memory is that the little friends are more profound.Come over the scene where the tide of the insects comes out of the body of our body!IntersectionBut this does not affect the set of refreshing and stimulus that we can enjoy a group of refreshing and stimulus in the constant fighting process. Do not feel too cool!

But when there is always a cooling of passion, the single plot mode of ""Warmmer 40,000: Space Marine 2"" is too short. Basically, it can be cleared in ten hours, and the game is a linear plot. There is no setting of the branch lines.Even if there are so many small corners that have not been explored, there are no surprises and treasures in it. A few vocal chips are already the biggest harvest.Therefore, after clearing the plot, there is no need for many weeks.

Fortunately, ""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2"" still supports online multiplayer models. After selecting a profession in this mode, there will be some weapons restrictions.The realization is the greatest fun!The proficiency of the firearm that is improved through combat also gives the game with so some development elements, and the improvement of the corresponding firearm proficiency has become the biggest pursuit of better fighting with friends to fight better!Of course, online online mainly pays attention to the stability of the network, especially the captain. Once a drop is dropped, it will drag all the players to exit the game together!I have to recommend the UU accelerator here!Use the UU accelerator to accelerate the network to make the game, which is enough to make your entire game process steady as an old dog!——The friends no longer have to worry about the Internet drop!

In addition, at the beginning of the game, it seems that EPIC verification is needed (I haven't encountered it, but many friends have encountered it). Here is a solution to the friends who encounter EPIC verification:
1. Card EPIC service update: Close the game and Steam; open the EPIC acceleration of the accelerator; search for the EPIC process in the Windows task manager and turn it off; then open the Steam to check the integrity of the game; click to start the game, re -update the EPIC ONLINE ServiceEnter the game.
2. TheEPIC service update is still unable to play the game: enter the installation directory of the game, and directly start the ""Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2"" to enter the game.

Finally, the designer of the keyboard key position of the game operation must be a ""genius"", and it designs the block to the C key!What the hell is this ghost animal design!IntersectionIntersectionIt is still recommended to use the handle here, which is better adaptable for game operations!It can also make the battle more comfortable!

In the end, we need to praise the emperor!He gave us such a refreshing gaming experience!Let us fight together for the emperor!Fight for loyalty!",2024/9/10,zh-cn

The emperor, the talent, the virtue of the saints, the courage of the warrior, the wisdom of the wise.At the beginning of the Tyra, it was the hometown of human beings. After all the difficulties, it was difficult to flatten the enemy, and finally built the Great Wall of Human beings.His ambition is not only to conquer the territory, but also the place for human beings to survive. Following the fire of civilization, in the endless darkness, the Bright Avenue is opened.

The territory of the empire is vast and vast, spread throughout the galaxy.Wan Xing is like a torch, all of which are under its governance.His soldier, known as Star Warrior, was wearing a heavy armor, holding a sharp blade, without fear of life and death, and vowed to fight for the emperor.Whenever the war, I will go forward bravely, and I am invincible.The spirit of its spirit is just like steel and indestructible.

The virtue of the emperor, widely set the universe, and its grace is like rain to moisturize all things.Under its rule, the people were able to live in peace and work, and soldiers were able to report to the country.The law is strict, and the reward and punishment are clear, so that people's hearts are attached, and they all praise their names.The name of the emperor is circulated between the Xinghe, which is the soul of the empire, and the immortal.

However, the dark current in the universe is surging, the enemy is around, and the heresy statement has emerged from time to time.With its supreme wisdom, the Emperor created many systems to expel the heresy and consolidate the foundation of the empire.The light of faith, Pu Zhaozhu, admires all peoples, and hide in heresy.Those who deviate will be condemned by the world and make people feel correct.

The prosperity of the empire depends on the leadership of the Emperor, and the loyalty of its ministers and the people.The ministers are loyal to the liver and be loyal, and they are exhausted to report to the country.On the side of the Emperor, there are many wise men who have contributed strategies, planned all the planning, and help them achieve their achievements.The power of the empire, shocked the Xinghe, the enemy heard the wind and was frightened, and dared to commit it lightly.

Therefore, the existence of the empire is the blessing of human beings, the virtue of the emperor, and the flow of all the world.With this ambition, the spirit of the Emperor Emperor and the Emperor of the Emperor God, for the sake of human beings, struggle.May the light of the empire, the forever in the universe, the name of the emperor, the eternal life.This is my wish, and it is also the wish of all humanity.

Conclusion:

The Xinghe is vast, only the imperial emperor, long live the emperor, and the world.If humans have God, they must be the emperor; if the universe has light, it must be an empire.May this glory, never go out, wish this great career, passed down from generation to generation.I should wait for this ambition, to be the honor of the empire, the honor of the emperor, and work unremitting!",2024/9/14,zh-tw

I'd say the game is a bit pricey for its current content, but a roadmap has already been released with content through to the end of 2025.

The single-player campaign, is the sequel to the first opus and can be played solo or in co-op for up to 3 players. It's really good, but rather short (I'd say 8 hours of play).

Then there's a less scripted co-op campaign where you can customize your space marine and play different classes. It's fairly short, but is designed to be played several times to improve your characters.

In 2024, among all releases, I was waiting for this particular game.The expectations were mundane at the level of ""post -shooter from 3 faces of the hour for 6.""On the one hand, it turned out, and on the other, the game gave a lot of impressions.

Visual component
She is amazing here.The graphics of the present look like a large project of 2024.Artists perfectly conveyed the most complicated architecture of the world Warhammer 40k, while not going to compromises.Yes, we are often locked in small in the same type of locations, but it is worth reaching the surface and you see the scale of the war: monumental buildings that combine medieval archival with retro futurism against which hundreds of people with thousands of creatures fight.This is impressive.

This is not a new genre, but it is unique.On the one hand, this is, on the other hand.However, despite a simple genre generalization.For example, from Doom that allow you to get armor and health and are necessary for survival.There is a simplified for close combat, which also provides survival in battle.Various variations from long -distance, to close combat and close combat combinations.This gameplay at first seems loaded, but after the hour of the game you understand how everything is simple in it and how everything is in its place without unnecessary mechanic.Animation of finishing achievements is juicy and more spectacular than in doom.A sea of ​​blood and a crunch of alien creatures.Sweet Baby Inc is smoked aside.


The musical component is made in the style of the game, but.When you go to crumble hundreds and thousands of opponents, I would like to do it under an expressive soundtrack so that the audio -component synchronize with what is happening on the screen.Unfortunately, this is not here.Even in subtitles they did not add any memorable music, this is sadness.

With her spirit of pathos and the desperate recklessness of the endless war of everyone with everyone.Subject, the game is tied to the first part, but knowledge of the plot of the first part is necessary only for understanding 1-2 tweosts for the entire plot, therefore.

What .In this game, the final is made by the finale.With all the epic, the effects and scale among which the player who reached the final uses all his arsenal and skills to the maximum.It looks spectacular.

It is also worth briefly mentioning that here, but the abundance of modes more justifies the price tag spent on the game.I still run to the seemingly simple multiplayer.

For me, this is an example of those games that I dreamed of zero when the game industry only developed: spectacular juicy gameplay, epic from the number of opponents, a beautiful graphics and the ability to pass all this in a cooperative if desired.Earlier, I only imagined this, playing the classic strategies for Warhammer 40k, and today, Saber Interactive gave us the first expensive game for this huge and old franchise.Definitely, for me it is.",2024/9/23,ru

A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
By: decizion


Satisfying gunplay, good melee combat, great graphics.
The campaign is average and short but still well worth playing.
Co-op operations are fun but we need lot more of them.
PVP I personally don't care and will never play it.



Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a good game but there's not enough content atm.
The gameplay is good but it's sadly a bit repetitive after a while.
The operations are highly replayable, thanks to the different classes which are all fun to play but there is sadly not enough maps right now. I'm max rank with best weapons on Vanguard, Assault, Tactical and Sniper so there's not much left to do in the game for me now.

As it currently stands I must say that games like Darktide, Exoprimal, Earth Defense Force or Warframe for examples are way better survival/horde co-op games simply because they provide lot more replay value.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a worthy addition to your survival/horde/co-op games collection, Saber did a good job with this one and I'm very hyped to see what future content they have in store for us in the future.

Typically, we are talking about a single category for a one -time passage, which is well done otherwise, but nothing extra.In short, Story has established a crusade campaign to regain lost worlds from their enemies.

Essentially, we go ahead and grind our opponents on a closed course.In fact, wood wedges are simple mechanics and can be played in 6-8 hours.Which is a red point that you can take the whole campaign in a 3 -person COOP game mode.And with the progress of the story, there are so -called Operation missions, which take place next to the main Story at the same time, of which there are a total of 6 missions.You can develop, there is a Skill sector, but its multi -sector is not attracted.

Graphics are fine, environmental elements, details, the whole world has been spectacular.And all I could write about sounds is average.We will see optimization that it did well.Ultra settings 1440p, RTX 3080, i7 9700k on average 70-80 fps.

As a negative, CPU is a strong game.Today's more demanding games with max graphics are around CPU max 50-55c, but here the 60-67C reaches smoothly.It is a pity to miss HDR and the installation of EPIC compulsion is tragic.The price is dependent on who is worth a 6-8 hour relatively linear campaign.

A1SOR,1,77.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ALSOR/,"I knocked out all Achivka and thesis I tell about Space Marine 2

The irony is that I hate to knock out acerification, platinum and that's all.Only in exceptional cases when the gameplay is too much like.Usually I just go through the game and do not even open a list of available achievements.

But in this case, something went wrong.From the game I just did not want to come off.Well, I decided that since I was dependent in it, why not knock out everything that is in it.Happiness is that all that you need to do is just play.Exceptions are several academicians to collect audiologists and ""kill something while it does something there.""But there are few of them, so there was no need to be distracted from the zarub.

Well, after this, I want to briefly summarize my expirence.


The first thing that catches the eye when starting the game is the picture.In particular - qualitatively worked out backs and environment.Technologically, the game does not offer something supernatural.What can not be said about magnificent architecture and interiors, about brutal battles occurring against the background and about close attention to details.The artists tried perfectly, because all this sets the necessary mood.


Namely, the mood for the ongoing action, where a spectacular slasher with a simple combo system and a good third-person shooter, makes a SM2 combat system in some way, are made in equal proportions.









Levels in PVE and in the campaign cannot boast of complexity and branching.However, this never had great importance to me in the games of this genre.The most important thing is that LVV-design play the hands of the main systems and does not interfere with the game to be a fan.So it works in SM2.The maximum where you can turn from the main road is for audio loses, but for a couple of ammunition boxes and temporary improvements for armor.Otherwise, the game does not interfere with the most important - endless meat grinder.And this is great.


For my happiness, I went through the game in a duo-coope.And this game works perfectly in this mode.The bots in the game are incredibly stupid and all that they are capable of is to raise a fallen Timmate.And then not always.From the point of view of their combat effectiveness and benefit in the implementation of joint tasks, everything is bad here.So my advice is to you-play with at least one friend, and ideally in a full-style.

Incredibly primitive, laughter, pathos and if you are not a fan of the universe, then this will probably be the weakest aspect for you.However, to say that he was completely failed - I also can’t: the game is trying to intrigue, the development of characters and even try to surprise with Cliffhanger, who will be understandable only to those who played in the first part.In general, the plot here is a pure function, which is a justification for an ongoing meat grinder.

Separately, I want to highlight the solution of developers to make a narrative to tie the main plot and PVE operation.While Titus is dealing with the most important things, somewhere in the background other guys decide something secondary, which helps the main team.It turns out an interesting interweaving.At the same time, no one forbids to go through the PVE mission, and then the plot.To some extent, this may even affect the perception of the main story.",2024/11/28,ru
[★] NapoSky_* ☺,1,110.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/napoleon59w/,"This game is an all -azimuth banger.
In advance: forget the opinions of the streamers, forget the opinions of the casus which expect to have everything within hand without doing anything.It's neither the game for nor the universe for.
If you made the first Warhammer: Space Marine, one watchword: go for it.For the emperor.

Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 is definitely the worthy successor of the previous opus.
- Did you find graphic gaps in the first?Swept away.
- Did you feel like you are always alone in a huge universe?Forget.
- Did you go around the first by saying that it was rather arcade with a little slammed difficulty?Also forget here, we try.There are really many tyrannids, and chaos agents hit heavy
- Are you a fan of Astartes fanmades videos?Here we still go up a notch.

A bit like Doom Eternal, you could stop in front of various fighting plans in the distance so much the decor is dynamic.At first glance you can say to yourself ""haha, out of a thousand tyrannids I will only have 10"".No, no deceptions, you will really eat hordes in time.

Conversely, casus which say that the campaign is terminated in 6 hours (by playing in easy and rusing, of course).Allow 10 hours to try to complete it in a veteran, and a little more than 8 pm in the angel of death (ie ""no less than the first opus"").The difficulty is there, and cooperation is in order.You are in perpetual movement in an invasion of a hive vessel which is there to eradicate you.

The operations complete the scenario since they are skimping missions annexed to Titus missions, allowing you to discover new objectives, and for your greatest pleasure: new bosses.

Do you remember the Lore of 1?Be ready for the scenario deployed by the 2.


All that to say:
+ Definitely a banger for an AA studio
+ The Lore, the script, the cutscenes, the graphics are monstrous
/ We could cut on linearity, but very clearly given the quality deployed with 13 years of waiting, it is really a detail.

The Order of the Ultramarinov, the protagonist of the first part of the game, is sent to the Avaraks and Kadaku systems to repel the attack of tyranids.In the ranks of the order, a detachment of Lieutenant Titus, consisting of a sergeant, Gardriel and brother of Haron, fights.
It is a mixture of action genres and a third -person shooter.The player has to take on the role of the cosmic paratrooper of the Order of the Ultramarins, fighting against tyranids - a hostile race, striving to destroy humanity.

SM2 at its best is another great addition to the highly loved horde shooter genre with a WH40K coat of paint on it, with my high love for WH40K it was a great journey to go through this game and be genuinely in awe over environment work and how being a space marine should truly feel.

For some this may not reach the expectations that they had been hoping for after such a long wait, for me i was satisfied with story and length. The COOP experience allowed for a lot more of a immersive time.

This is a genre of game that can always live on and with time if supported with their already shown roadmap, this will easily live up to being one of the best WH40K games next to the Dawn of War series.

Of course with a game like this it is expected that people will get tired of doing the same thing over and over with the minimal amount of content based inside PvE and PVP on launch, for what it is im already 30-40 hours in and still finding fun in spending time making myself look amazing with customization and PVP every now and then.

For twenty and a little hours, the impressions of the game are extremely positive.Everything looks expensive-god, I have something to admire.The style of the universe is recreated perfectly, it is pleasant to consider architecture and other environment on locations between meat grinders with opponents.The background of open levels is almost always dynamic, which adds the scale of what is happening, the liveliness of the world and the sensations of planetary hostilities.The combat system is rather not bad, combining distant and close battle.There is a dion, rebound, block and parrying.You can do meat colorful finishing, the animations of which are more than 50 pieces.They depend on your weapons, the enemy and his position in relation to you.Opponents sometimes have a piercing with whole teeming hordes, like rats in the games of a Plague Tale, which looks epic.
Together, you can take both the main plot of the game and individual combat operations, which are currently 6 pieces.They are woven into the main plot, showing some events developing in parallel.The choice of four difficulties and six classes of fighters with different abilities, weapons and survivability.Cooperative is cross -platform and works fine.
The multiplayer resembles GEARS of WAR, except that you can’t sit down for a shelter.So far, there are only a few cards and three modes, two of which are “Desmach” and “capture and retention”.Team 6na6 with the same 6th classes of fighters.The team can have no more than two fighters of the same class.The multiplayer works fine, although there are times when it throws off when connecting from the server, and the entire lobby and the search begins again, I hope they will fix it.Despite the fact that many complain about the technical condition of the game, my game itself flew out in 20 hours only once and, strangely just at the first launch, so it is not considered.
I think the developers can be proud of their creation, and the game will become a worthy part of the Universe, where the war goes forever.They even have any plans to support the game in the future, which is curious.Personally, I demand the addition of the seventh grade ""Apothecaria"" with the possibility of outfitting allies and cut out progenoids from the fallen comrades.",2024/9/6,ru

By the time you try to be drunk with Warhammer Pong.After the first, the second round is like a drinking ceremony to take care of each multi.
I think I wake up and think about going home or secondary.

Why do you recommend it?
No T -type Geno?Is it a gin stealer?Is it a hostage?
Inquitter Call number 111


The most important thing
'Can you do this game Warhammer?'
Unfortunately, people who don't know Warhammer will feel like watching the Infinity War for the first time in the Marvel movie.

Why are you suspicious of the protagonist?What is Deathwatch?Chaplin is a good one?
What is the knife?What are the children like juggling?

In other words, people you know are injected with Warhammerpong.
To the early Tyranid situation, the latter part of the situation, and the Ultramarin's assembly, which was ignored by Smurfra
Dreadnot's performance scenes, which were ignored by various media ...
It is like the next generation of karaoke that is almost infinite for people.


Except for that, it is a repetition of enemy hordes and movements while protecting it.
As the battle itself passes, it becomes boring.Impact disappears.The anticipated Horder was cool
If you don't have an uncomfortable targeting, try it hard.
The counterattack is a fraudulent, but it doesn't work well for the jobs.Rather, boss war is easy.1 to 1


In addition, music.
There is no memorable music to break the game.
Dark tide next to the neighborhood is a marine jjajang nuggle game
If you only hear the OST, the tears are the opposite of the emperor's thoughts.
This game is like a hymn from the church on Sunday, which is obliged to see the Majesty of the Emperor.


And as a whole, the game is a bit lighter
Tytus jumps like a girl walking out.
You can give you more vibration on the pad, but you can resonate the axis when you run.
The idea of ​​the game is from the start to the end of the game.


There was a lot of acclaim for hitting, but I'm a little disappointing
As the times changed, I expected a much better feeling compared to the previous or franchise similar works.
The firearms sounds like a siege tank, and the bolt's power is less than the hitting feeling.
Even in the case of Melta Gun, the effect is too big on the screen, so what is the kids beyond the effect?

It's not bad, but it's not cool.
It's a pity that the Homagunt is the Astartes game.
I can't Oba like a martial arts, but I feel about 80% of the feeling of changing it more cool.
Personally, the most anticipated cheaphammer is the most unfortunate.
It tastes like wielding, but the taste of the hand was a little lower.
The latte is the same, but I was looking forward to the mulberry taste of Space Marine 1, but it was a little different.


It's a multi -entered game, so I can't help it.


Multi is not yet deeply embarrassed by PVP, but I won't evaluate it,
First of all, I see a lot of Chinese .....
The proximity of the proximity is a net, but of course the patch will be
The Warrowhammer fans know that the balan network is a long tradition of Warhammer Franchise.

PVE was interesting because it was the story of a team that was ordered by Taitos in the campaign and went to another mission.
It's a team of Balius, who went to catch a hive tirent when the Taitus team bypassed it.
It was nice to have an improved AI with the improved AI.
The downside is that the battlefield has been wide, so each individual has a busy situation rather than cooperation.
This is the problem of the workshop.

as a result
It's a delicious game to eat and eat this game, it's hard to know.
Marvel cinematic study is a kids' joke
Nevertheless, the fun of cutting the Horde from the battlefield drawn with the next generation engine is good in the short term.

Jokes aside, this game is everything the Warhammer 40k: Space Marine community has been hoping for. Not only does it serve as a solid sequel to the previous title, but it also sends a clear message to the gaming industry: players are craving shorter, simpler games that deliver high quality and polish. Here’s what it brings to the table:

Intense Combat: The seamless blend of gunplay and melee combat keeps the action dynamic and engaging throughout.

Visuals and Environment Design: The graphical upgrades and meticulous attention to detail provide an impressive visual experience.

Immersive Storyline: The game draws you into the dystopian Warhammer 40k universe with a mature narrative that revolves around epic battles.

Challenging Enemy Hordes: Facing off against the Tyranids adds an extra layer of difficulty, requiring constant movement and strategic thinking. And let's not forget the heretic traitors—on higher difficulty levels, they’re formidable opponents that force you to rethink your strategy.

Stunning Art Direction: It’s often overlooked, but the art direction in this game is phenomenal. From sprawling battlefield scenes to towering cathedrals, every building and wall feels like a piece of art. The combat may keep you too busy to notice, but when you get a moment to take it all in, it’s hard not to be impressed.

That said, there are a few caveats:

Potential Repetitiveness: Depending on your progression, the horde combat can start to feel repetitive.

Campaign Length: The campaign is fairly standard in length and varies with difficulty, but the narrative remains compelling throughout.

All in all, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 serves as a beacon for the industry, proving that you don’t need groundbreaking innovations to create a great game. Sometimes, a bit of refinement to an already solid formula is all it takes. That’s my take on the game—I hope this helps you decide whether it’s worth a playthrough! :)

Honestly, I feel like raising my score to a solid 9/10, it somehow kept getting better and more epic every hour. I haven't even touched the operations and PVP yet, but I'm ready for more gameplay, it was awesome. Could you find some nitpicks? Sure, I heard some people saying that it's too coop oriented, finishers don't give you health the same way as in the first game, etc, but I personally loved it. One of the best 40K games out there at this point.

EARLY REVIEW

I’ve gotta say - before I played it myself, I had a healthy dose of doubts and was just cautiously optimistic about this game, but man - it’s a blast so far! Considering the amount of epicness happening at all times, it is surprisingly well optimized and runs at very stable 60 with all high settings. The main thing that might bottleneck for some people is CPU, so you might wanna check that (thankfully I have no problems with it).

Gameplay-wise, it’s quite fun, more engaging and deeper than the first game, but it is more coop/online oriented (however, I have no issues playing it solo currently).

Story-wise - pretty much what you might expect from an action game based in the 40k. Nothing groundbreaking, but the tone is great, and characters are enjoyable.

Graphics, art, sound design - really impressed, you can feel the scale of big war, but at the same time there are little details everywhere that fans will surely appreciate. Guns and music are more meaty this time around, which I love.

Long story short - if you like solid, gripping action, and of course, the 40k universe, then it’s a must! GO SLAY SOME TYRANIDS FOR THE EMPEROR, BROTHER

Fan gods like me are also well implemented in the walls that are crazy and dying.It's just a god.
Warhammer worldview setting atmosphere.
As the campaign in the middle of the NPC conversations or the surrounding environment, the more immersive, the more immersive and I feel as if I am a real smile.
Many enemy groups are crazy.When the enemies approach, 'Come.'This word is thrilled enough to explode with fostering.
The sound of combat execution action Jirim headset is raised loudly.
The short campaign will be bored with the crazy story that makes the lifespan change and the man who is a man.If the chick plays this game, it is a testosterone that will grow into an emperor's symbolic pair.
Chun -nam, a dog like a slanesh.
There's a lot to do after the campaign.But it's not a severe noga.If you go to a high risk mission under the assumption of a true Adaptus Artartes, you will soon take a job level.
It's like the best of the recent games.

It can be seen as a cold beer that drinks dirty on a dirty day.

General evaluation
The best game among the 40K Warhammer.There were a lot of games like Unclean One's bowel movements, but for some reason, a huge masterpiece was born.

----- Finally, the emperor woke up in the golden throne and did a miracle .------
It would be enough to say a word.

The people who hit the fanzine of the Zenchi also say that the story is short, the hitting feeling is copper.
I don't know if there's a better game than this.

You don't have to listen.They are dissatisfied with the fact that they know that there is no perfection and find perfect in the game.
Listen and report yourself and judge.

The emperor, who had a strange key setting, was whining and the compromise was not talented, and even humans, who had difficulty and did not have fun, allowed a refund.
I hope you can play with the refund system.

Balgrim,1,53.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987710793/,"** Transcription Vox of a sea space after having experienced Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 **

Brothers, listen to my words, because I have just gone through an experience that could almost equal the glory of the real battlefield.I played an entertainment of the Imperium, named ** Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 **, and I must say that it is worthy of the greatest heroes of the Adeptus Astartes.

From the moment I took control of the marine space in this simulacrum, I felt a familiar power, that of our energetic armor, faithful and heavy, each resonant step with overwhelming intensity.The developers of this game have accurately captured the honor and terror that accompany the wearing of a Mark VII armor.The fight ... Ah, the fight, brothers!Each shunner sword stroke vibrates with a brutal truth, each bolter shot strikes with the strength of the emperor himself.They understood what it means to conduct a holy war against xenos and heretics.

The enemies I faced, these detestable tyrants, were numerous and ferocious.Their endless carnage reminded me of the wars on Macragge.The game perfectly captures the frenzy of their assaults, forcing you to hold your line, to use each bolt and each stroke with precision.You feel the urgency, the sacred obligation to protect the imperium at all costs.At no time did I feel vulnerable, because as in reality, I knew that duty transcends us.But the tension, brothers ... The tension was palpable, each battle a test of faith and steel.

The visual of this game is a real ode to the Imperium.Impressive citadels, bordered by statues of angels and sacred relics, to the vast battlefields where blood and mud mix ... everything breathes the 41st millennium.Each detail seems blessed by the technoprêtres of Mars, a loyalty such that one would think it would walk on the emperor's own worlds.

And music!Brothers, she resonates like the Songs of Chaplains before the battle.She takes you beyond the limits of the flesh, pushing you to fight even more ardently for humanity.Each note seems to be reinforced by faith in our Holy Emperor-Dieu.

I tell you without hesitation: this game is a blessing, an honorable way for those who cannot yet join our ranks to understand what it means to be an astartes.Whether you are aspiring, Imperium's servants, or even simple citizens, ** Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 ** will give you an overview of our existence, of our sacred duty.

Brothers, if you have time to devote outside the real fight, then play this game. Because it will remind you of the glory of our mission, the weight of our armor, and the greatness of serving the Emperor.

tragic,1,565,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cureton/,"At the time of my review, I've done everything there is to do in PVE. I've gotten every class to 25, unlocked every perk, leveled every weapon to relic tier, unlocked every mastery point for each weapon, unlocked every heraldry, unlocked every cosmetic (through operations - 35 successful missions per class), and beat every operation on ruthless. Also beat the campaign, which I enjoyed.

The moment to moment gameplay is fun and rewarding as there is a skill element to maximizing your offense. Parry and Perfect dodge are great additions. All of the combat mechanics combined make grinding for unlocks in operations more of a fun journey than a chore, at least for me.

For those wondering about campaign length. It's approximately 7 hours give or take, and if you are on harder difficulties, you may find that to be longer. When you combine that with the Operations that tie into the story, that buffs it up to the 10-12 hour range.

Doing all the operations on ruthless difficulty (current max) and soloing them all was a really fun challenge, but it's not required.

EDIT: I've now played a ton of PVP (still ranking up) and I'm having a blast. At max Veterancy Level (25), I've played 100s of matches. The PVP is quite good, but it suffers from map variety. The balance is actually quite good, and there are plenty of strategies and counter strategies appearing as players get more experienced.

Overall, great game, I didn't run into any major issues, all of the classes are fun (and will be funner when a few small bugs are fixed). Emailed the devs and they mentioned a few of the bugs that I had submitted have already been addressed. I'll report back with my findings.

RE: Hours played: I was in both the preview and review periods of the game (which was about a month or so) which is why I have a considerable amount of hours. Not ALL of the hours were 100% playtime of course... things like setting up scenarios for videos, capturing footage, editing... but I would say I probably have at least 300+ hours of playtime in the game.

Review on September 8th

If you see a friend who commented on my comment, if you are not brain disabled or want or like Thai -Japanese or Smurfs if you are not brain -residual powder or you really want or really want to or like the sacrifice group.


After exiting the game, the more you think about it, the more and more uncomfortable. You say that I am a pure hammer Xiaobai. Even if I don't care so much, I don’t care about it.But at least I have liked this subject from the War Dawn 1, so I will care about some settings that have been moving to the game in the game.

The interstellar warrior here is a new one, right? The original Star Warrior should be higher, stronger, stronger, and faster than the first generation of this game. In addition to the picture, what do you think have changed?Well, I think in this game, the performance has become weakened. After the casting of Thai and Japan, the ""Blessing of Blood God"" will not be executed and the blood will become poor.Three times that of Beef is really three times and the energy of the armor 1 generation may be 5 times the speed of this.It's not the samurai that is not the samurai, but you only need 2. So how much do you see the knife and insects in the game? Sorry, I did n’t count anyway anyway.Of course, your operation is not blocked directly to the street

Okay, then our new Star Warrior power, what do you say? Should I take that difficulty 4 level? Okay anyway, you don’t have the bad cans of Magnus's cubs.Quickly solve a bad canned food, which is likely to be resolved by him that people can kill you in seconds and you may not be able to take him in seconds.

Then let's take a look at the military weapons prepared by Dorakle for everyone?Um, in the case of almost difficulty in various explosives and weapons 4, in addition to those specialized headshots, the remaining remaining are all abandoned and miscellaneous goals.It may not be done after two elites that may not be done, even one may not be done because the other party is also moving you, but the spiritual flames that may be blasted on the opposite side can make you a pink powder. Is this a new weapon? Is this a new weapon?Why is the difference between the differences in the official books I read? I think it ’s not as good as that of the first generation. These guns even do I even think that the production team has never seen the weapon setting of the warhammer?When I used a hot -melt gun, I concluded that the production team only looked at the picture. The hot -melt cleaning of the miscellaneous soldiers listened to such a thing.Well, but ah, but have you seen a samurai, can you eat 5 rounds of hot face?Um can eat 7 ~ 9 rounds ... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Then ah the hot -melt bomb. This stuff is very powerful and you can only bring one of these after picking up. This is not a problem. This thing. You can only put it down in place.It is impossible for you to even throw a hot -melt bomb. This hot melt is heavier than the biological crustal on the back of the dumplings ~~ Anyway, the biological crust on the back is shot to the one hand. I can't understand it.These new interstellar warriors

Then the so -called original casting equipment is modularized. Um in this game, you have become a career.Equipped to armed into a specific type of interstellar warrior instead of a professional production team should go to see the official settings and then become a profession, which causes many weapons to become fixed.Use bandit and then heavy rifle. Only the so -called tactical Star Warriors can use it. Haha ... I want to sayIn the pioneer, what weapon he took in his hand?Do you dare to tell me the production team?Don't know?That is obviously a heavy -duty explosion rifle installed with fireproofer ~~~ Know, everyone said that the production team did not play the pioneer in the original star -like modular performance game.GM's melee weapon has also been fixedly fixed with our tactical Star Warrior to bring a full set. Sorry, I don’t like the Shield Guard.

I don’t want to say a few chicken ribs, and some of them are some of the chicken ribs.

Then there is a sacred thing in the game. You can pick up and take it after you fall to the ground. You can get up such a funny thing after falling to the ground. We use the original Star Fighter.Bellyza
In a good actual game, we have no functions of this stove. I want to fan you, you read, okay?
It's okay to see the rules ~~~ I don’t know what is the Bellysa Storo.

Then continue to vomit, it is not as good as the first generation and the first generation. You can make the enemy under the loss of the enemy through the melee weapon.The enemy who was originally there was still the enemy that was refreshed later.Flash red can execute the brushed strange tide mobs, you can only set off a shooting execution after flying at most, and this shooting execution may be interrupted or you use it in the center of the strange tide.Frames, but the enemy has been stinging for you when you execute it, you are lucky, and you will die directly, and the shooting is executed at most back to one grid. I said that you are crispy as a paper 1 grid.

In other words, the producer is a set of zombie world wars. If you see a friend who commented on my comment, if you are not brain -residual or want or like Thai and Sky Elite TroupeIt is really recommended to refund and then attach the original surgery three items below

Tendon coil: Even with the constitution far beyond ordinary mortals, an ordinary interstellar warrior will still have a lot of risks to fight with bare hands and air fists.The tendon coil can greatly enhance the body's surface skin and muscle strength of an original Star -over warrior. A mortal unresolved mortal may not be able to penetrate the metal shell of the chariot or a reinforcement soil.Walls, but the original Star -made soldiers can do it in a normal state.In addition, reinforced muscles and skin can better protect the organs and implants in their bodies, especially the black crustal connected to the power armor.

Holy Poor pituitary: This leaf -shaped plant with the size of the thumb nails will be implanted into the core part of the brain.Its biggest effect is the existing organs in the original casting Star Warrior, especially the enhancement of bones and muscles. This is why the original Star -made soldiers are generally higher than that of ordinary interstellar soldiers.It is worth mentioning that this implanted organ was originally designed by the emperor himself to make the original body. Kobe himself only retains the part of the right half of the brain. As for the drawings on the left half of the brainEssence

Belizerlus furnace: This organ that has been sleeping in normal times is called ""the person who dies"", and it connects two hearts at the same time.When the original Star -made soldiers receive a high -intensity spiritual impact or trauma, it releases homemade chemicals similar to anti -stimulant. These chemicals also help the wound regeneration and wake -up consciousness.After activating for a period of time, the glands will enter the dormant state again, because it takes time to secrete and supplement the substance to activate it again.Many of the original Star -made soldiers, including the original casting leader team leader Calga, escaped the magic claws of death because of this organ.Author: Emperor Emperor Poison Blade Source: Bilibili














----------------------------------------------------------------------- The following comments are comments that only started playing on September 6th
What do you say after playing overall? It is difficult to say that the production level of European and American games is really average

I was looking forward to it at first and after reading the leak version, I looked forward to it.

The first is the problem of EPIC. I also installed that thing but I didn’t be updated by anything or I would not download it.Very easy to turn equal to no

Next, the game content optimization was very slow at first, and then the CG result of the first paragraph of the game actually stuck the problem or loaded the problem anyway.There is no special problem when it is smooth

Then there is the feeling of feel and the difference between the first generation. First of all, you have no execution of the blood combat. The execution of the pistol will be interrupted anyway. I have been interrupted.It's all from a key pair, that is, your mouse. You can quickly lightly press and stabilize. It is a hit. This causes you to contact me with melee. Sometimes it is not flexible.at this point

Then the problem of executing is that the pistol counterattack is that you can escape or block the successful block that can trigger a shooting counterattack some elite enemies can be twice and then the miscellaneous soldiers are basically the block.It is a shot to get a shooting execution, but this shooting execution is embarrassing. Sometimes when is it embarrassing? It must be the end of your current action when you are in the enemy group.You can force the action to enter the execution. This will cause you a trigger button that you have already shot the enemy and the enemy that has appeared in a melee hit.Just shift the position or the enemy is beyond the range or directly determine that it fails to trigger, which causes you to be beaten by the strange operation.

In other words, the remote execution and your movements have a problem with your movement. If you can directly make an image, you can immediately interrupt the current action.


Next is the online mode part of the PVE. You did n’t customize the picture given you the picture. It seems that there is only one to play a total of 6 pictures and then play a game anyway.The liver's weapon requires material anyway, I didn’t see it anyway, just right, it may not give you the experience of the 0 Legion Skin, you can get the experience that you can get the customs clearance to unlock it, but the elite installation must clear the specific requirements. For exampleAh

In general, it may be that except for the customs and the characteristics of the skin and the characteristics of the weapon.The key to hit the button is not as good as the first generation of the first generation.

I just want to say that I have n’t intended to play on September 9th on September 9th. If you are not hammered, my suggestion is a refund war hammer 40K game. This one can only be regarded as mediocre.Dark Horse But it seems that this game can be played, but it is not necessarily more fun. Friends who have thought about the plot. I suggest that if you are discounted, it is estimated that it will be discounted for about half a year.Just buy the game",2024/9/6,zh-cn
Brokeback Morgan,0,18,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Menua/,"I know I going to be on the unpopular side here, but I just want anyone thinking of buying the game to get the chance to see a review that tells it like it is.

I have never played a 40k game before, so without any passion or connection to the universe, I only can judge this game off of what it provides to me. This game is... not horrible, but it certainly isn't great either.

The campaign is short. Very short by today's standards. Like 6 hours, short. I finished in one sitting after work. Now, this isn't horrible, but it since the campaign is arguably the best part of the game, it being that short doesn't really bode well. Fun combat, great visuals, and an entertaining story... that you'll be done with at the end of the day.

Multiplayer is, well, not as great. The operations are interesting at best, monotonous at worst. You essentially get to play through a co-op mission of the campaign as the ""B-team"" that you would always order to go do stuff. It provides an interesting and new perspective, but is certainly nothing great. The ""endless"" war multiplayer, I.E the PvP, is fun for about, well, 2 days. Afterwards you realize you only have 3 game modes on 3 maps. It gets repetitive instantly.

Now I know what you're gonna say, ""oh but there will be updates, and look at the roadmap!"". My brother, you are paying $60 at least for a 6 hour campaign and lackluster multiplayer that you will get tired of in two days.",2024/9/7,en

thelukygamer17,1,42.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199121782677/,"First of all, the game is extremely short, the countryside are barely about ten hours and it matters a lot that you want to redo the same 6 coop missions dozens of times to unlock the cosmetics and level the 6 classes with their respective weapons (I have not tried the PVP and I don't think I will do it shortly), but it is really fun and despite having only 6 missions to be repeated and repeat they do not become boring immediately thanks to the randomness of the spawn of enemies and resources, the combat is wellStudied, the final moves are spectacular and the weapons are all more or less useful based on your playstyle.In addition, the fact that there is no Wake contamination is absolutely a huge value.

Some classes, such as an attack aircraft, are just worse than other options: what is the point of it if Vangard does everything better than him?Jetpak is very naval.

Lock class in operations is a very stupid solution: do you want to play highly difficult?Swear 2 classes at least otherwise you will stand for 5 minutes in peeps with another tactician in the detachment.

The balance of opponents is very strange: Tzaangors with shields withstand a power fist in the face with a blow.A simple warrior of Nidov withstands 4 shot of Meltagan in the face.The enemies are very accurately shooting and refusing to fight in close combat even close, preferring to back and shoot while the player has to swing forward, since most of the weapons of near -battle do not have a moment in attacks on attacks.

The gameplay design is very strange too: what is the point of Gan Strike if the invulnerability window is so small?What is the point of it if the simplest tyranids remove armor in 1 blow?The mechanics of the parry is cool but only works in 1 by 1 or 2 by 1. More?You can not even try.Plus, why fend to parry when the dumts do the same thing only work on red attacks that cannot be spaced?

PVP is generally quiet horror: Vangard is the most broken class.Hook-> You shoot point blank from the carbine and win duel 1 on 1 with any class.Against Bulvarka, you just bother and make a hook again if it raised a shield.Most of the long -range weapons have above the traffic police than the near -battle weapons, so it’s better to just shoot at point blank range because there is no animation interruption.Therefore, at the moment, PVP is just running around and shooting from carbines at point blank range for the most part.

Campaign: in general, it is well done, but if you play 3+ difficulties, then again the Elden Ring turns out and not the cosmodes simulator that spoils the sensations.The bots are absolutely useless and stupid, therefore, you can not even count on them.

Castomization: generally good.Colors and the ability to combine colors are very cool.The current pieces of armor for each class look good but frankly little.In fact, the last shooting range of cosmetics is just the 1st shooting range hung with seals and other things.In general, I would like more.

Operations: In general, interesting.But the absence of the director of Ishishka is felt.They become very monotonous literally on the 4th entry.The absence of specialists and a greater variety of elite opponents affects the general impression negatively.Plus, again, due to high complexity, you often just run past the opponents to the elevator/script since the economy of health and armor is absent on high difficulties in operations.If we talk about the characters' builds, then everything is scarce here.There are no gameplay elements in pumping weapons and classes.Very dull ""5% more damage"" or extremely rarely something in the spirit ""get 1 full store at low health levels.""

In general, I am disappointed with how I came out cm2.They should work hard on the gameplay design and the behavior of opponents and a common balance.At the moment, people like everything, but these problems will begin to beat very much along the life expectancy of the game literally a month after the release if you do not make changes.",2024/9/10,ru

1) Launch the game. The game will immediately attempt to install Epic Online Services. Cancel the installation box before it finishes. You will be met with an error message upon reaching the main menu. The EOS was never successfully installed, but remnants of the software are still on your machine.
2) Turn off crossplay in the game options menu of the game.
3) Close the game. Uninstall Epic Online Services from the list of programs on your computer.
4) Delete the Epic Online Services folder from the game's installation folder in your Steam library.
5) Reboot your computer and relaunch the game.

YuGo_Wolverino,1,13,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ydemonhunter/,"Pros:
+ The campaign, though short, is very fucking@.
+ Armor seems really heavy and this reflects on combat.You feel the weight in the gameplay.
+ The combat is intense, heavy and slow (in a good way) and so it is almost strategic.Space Marine 2 combat is a little Gears of War and Darksiders 1. A half an old school footprint.
+ Horde of enemies.
+ COOP mode.You can play the whole campaign in Coop.You + 2 friends.
+ Excellent art direction.The scenarios are beautiful.
+ Good graphics.
+ Good soundtrack.
+ This game has more testosterone than all Ubisoft games together.
+ The sealing of ""Games Workshop"" (company responsible for the Warhammer franchise that today embraced the Woke culture) did not arrive in Space Marine 2, a game developed by Interactive Knowledge.So Space Marine 2 respects the franchise lore.

Cons:
- Short campaign.The campaign can last 6 ~ 10h, depending on the difficulty and the way you play.
- Blood effects, when you shoot enemies or shatter they are very cartoonish.It could be a little more realistic.But this is just a matter of personal taste.But the gore of the game is still very good.
- Despite a very good amount of horde of enemies, they have few variations.
- The ""Operations"" (PVE) and ""Eternal War"" mode (PVP) are just repetitions.If you want to extend the time hours you will play these modes until you get tired.For those who, like me, don't care about PVP, it's even less content.
- Gold and Ultra editions (are clearly content taken from the base game so that they can sell these stupid editions for an exorbitant price)
- Season Pass.And the Seasons to come.These are more content taken from the base game, in order to extend the life of the game.
- Battle pass at game singleplay is the clown's cuh!
- Pay to play before.The infamous Early Access (or Early Unlock).Ubisoft and ea doing school.

ArthurKong,1,86.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198816063713/,"Warhammer Space Marine 2, it was for me the best game I played in recent years.Not because it is a game that tries to have a complex plot or something that tries to reach all audiences and end up pleasing anyone.This game tries and managed to propose to be simply a fun game.It has a companion, PVP and PVE mode and you will have fun with any of them.

The campaign is short, but it doesn't mean it's bad, because amount is not quality, few games have achieved a long and good campaign and are memorable to this day.The campaign has beginning, middle and end, well explained and with characters that will teach you through actions important values ​​for your real life, such as honor, duty and sacrifice (and for the most religious the importance of faith in your master/Salvador).The campaign has a natural difficulty that you can't be able to continue.

I didn't play PVP much enough just to get the achievements, but I had a lot of fun PVP is unbalanced only that the fun is that it is not pay to win, everyone has access to the same weapons, classes and so on.Maps well built and easy to memorize and play.

PVE is a show apart with operations that is co-reported with the campaign, very challenging Boss Fights, well-balanced and distinct levels of difficulties, each class you choose has a completely distinct gameplay built and skills.

What surprised me in this game was the relationship of the community with the developers where, everything is being resolved as quickly and fairly possible without fan service or something.

Space Marine 2 is an AAA pearl, for those who were unbelieving with the game market, this game is the solution.I met the Warhammer universe because I made new friends and after a long time away from multiplayer games I found one where it is healthy to invest my time.

RayNero,1,22.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raynero/,"Make the fans of war hammers satisfied, general players recommend a discount

Foreword:
After a lapse of 13 years, the generation of Star Warriors, formerly known as ""War Hammer: Killing Wushuang"", finally ushered in a sequel. The sequel not only changed the developer but also changed the publisher. It is produced by the team that has developed ""War World Z"", so there are many WWZ gameplay shadows, but the ""execution"" characteristics of the previous game have been retained; The problem of unstable instrument and repeated content of the existing game make some players feel that some players do not meet the pricing, but if you are the servant of the emperor's enthusiasm, now it is time to present loyalty!




The story of the game lasted for the first generation. Although the protagonist of the extreme warrior, although he tried to resist Okuk and chaos, he was still sent to the end of the trial court because he was accused of being stained with chaos. He was included in the ""Death Watching"" battle that specializes in the Termine Zerg. After a centennial battle of the Zerg, Titus was seriously injured in a mission. To live, the battle regiment transformed him into a more powerful ""Original Star Fighter"" and allowed him to return to the team as the deputy. Essence

The second -generation stories are developing compact, smooth narrative, and fully demonstrated the ""hard -core men's"" war hammer style. In the single -player battle, we played Titus to lead the new extreme soldiers to perform various tasks to prevent the Zerg and chaotic forces. In the PVE mission, the perspective of another team will help Titus complete the task and strengthen the plot not mentioned in the battle, but there is almost no element in the single -player battle, so that the sense of growth and change in the battle process will lack a sense of growth and change in the battle. Sex makes the battle a bit like a teaching for multiplayer models. The entire process is relatively short, about 7-8 hours of length. It is similar to a generation, which is a pity.






Whether it is the main line of battle or the PVE mode, players can enjoy the sense of refreshing combat strikes in this game. Use various weapons in the world of war hammers, such as ""power swords"" and ""hot melting guns"" to slaughter the Terlen Zerg However, strictly speaking, this game is not a unparalleled game. In the battle, under various Zerg enclosures, the armor and blood volume of the characters will be exhausted soon (not at all). The armor can be recovered with time. The blood volume is to kill the enemy to return the blood while turning the black background. We can only get an injection to make up for the black background. Therefore, we need to use the combat mechanism to make a certain ""right move"" with the enemy.

The Zerg soldiers rarely affect the players. You can concentrate on dealing with various elite heads on the battlefield. When the enemy attacks, the perfect grid and dodge can perform a ""gun attack"". Two enemies will show flaws. At this time, we can perform ""execution"" to restore armor immediately. This execution process is different from the generation. Invincible state can also be triggered at mid -range. Try to execute as much as possible!

It may not be refreshing enough to fight at first, but it is much simpler after mastering the way to interact with the enemy, but because of this, almost all battles will be carried out in the process of ""defense → gun attack → execution"". It will become a bit duplicate, no matter what the situation and occupation are inseparable from ""execution"".






In the PVE mode of the game, we can choose one of the six Star Warrior occupations to check the level. Each occupation has a fixed equipment that can be used, as well as unique skill trees. The weapon data collected in the level can make the guns skilled and get the number of gun skills. The current professional strength is a bit unbalanced. At the same time, the upgrade progress of each occupation is completely independent. If you practice heavy heads, the repetition will be relatively high.

The design purpose of the level used as PVE is to strengthen the main line of the main line, so there is a very fixed process in the level. Although the elite leader of the appearance is random, the overall change is not large. There will be a combination of map randomness+task randomness, so the repetition of the scrolling level will be faster and easier to get tired than other games under the comparison. Overall, the number of levels is not enough.

But like other war hammers IP games, this game has a very rich custom content. There can be various imprints, runes and badges on the armor, as well as 9 major legions, teams, and even Chaos Star Warrior factions. Various decorations and styles can be collected, but if you want to collect these decorations, there will be a long -length clearance process. It can be said to be created for fans. At present, one of the main incentives and pursuit of goals in multiplayer games.





现 The excellent picture performance, the battle scene of the spectacular epic battle
剧 Wonderful and compact plot, continuing the story of the generation
的 Fastened fighting, all kinds of execution of blood spraying slurry
装The handsome armor shape and appearance

The single -player battle process is short, and there are problems with optimization of specific scenes
关 Cooperative PVE mode level has fewer levels, fixed processes, and easy to get tired
The server is bad, and the ping will be traced back!
平 Insufficient balance between occupations and weapons





The game is currently optimized and the server connection is rotten, as well as a service -oriented game that is also a war hammer IP, such as the ""Plague"" series or a relatively new ""Black Tide"". After a month of upsurge, the number of players may drop sharply. This can only wait for the number of levels of the multi -person model after the official update. In terms of the current version, the situation of the war hammer powder can play very much. If you are satisfied, the non -fan is only a single CP value, and it is easy to enlarge the existing problems. Therefore, it is recommended that non -fan players can wait a little discount before starting.

For the first time, the game will be forced to install EPIC Online Serivers software. This is to allow users of different platforms to connect to the platform. The official seems to be written in the EULA protocol. If you really care, there are many ways to teach players on the Internet how to stop EOS. As long as there is no need for cross -platform connection, this is a software that can be completely installed. If you have any doubt ...",2024/9/15,ko

・ CO-OP will be able to select if you can clear the stage of the first campaign
・ Weapons that can be used with co-op are determined for each class
・ Enhance the class by consuming park points when the level goes up (passive)
・ One unique ability for each class (cool -down skill)
・ There is experience value for each weapon, and the weapon is strengthened at the point obtained by using it (with options)
・ There is a stray match
・ There is no trehan element that carefully selected with random drops of weapons like Warhammer Darktide
・ The stage is 6 in all at the moment x 4 difficulty levels
・ The length of the stage is about 30 minutes
・ Even at the time of Easy, it is difficult and dies
・ It seems that the types of enemies that appear on the stage will increase when the difficulty level goes up

-----------------------------------
Addendum to original submission, due to outrage from Inquisitorial conclave.
-----------------------------------
Let us review the game as a whole (newest update included):
Story:
Excellent, although it seems that some footage from several servo-skulls went missing.
Low initial mission count, supplemented by same number of operations (meant for multiplayer)
Score: 6/10

Visuals:
Relay congratulations to the Artists, Remeberancers and the Tech-Priests.
Score: 10/10

Lore:
As it should be. Personal note: Not sure why a race such as the *Redacted* would have a device that actively empowers warp rifts.
Score: 9/10

Connectivity:
Needs polish. It seems sudden and unpredictable Warp-storms are causing havoc with the Astropathic choir. Sometimes the Astronomican is barely visible.
Battle-Brothers are losing connection and are unable to join their squads, which is endangering mission continuity.
Score: 5/10

Multiplayer:
PvE element fun and satisfying. With several inconsistencies which currently appear to been worked on.
Score: 6/10

PvP element. Found an archeo-tech note which reads ""Not Great, Not Terrible""
Score: *Redacted*

Customization for Space Marines:
It would seem that members of *Redacted* have stolen most other Space Marine Chapters actual Gear.
For now it seems that the Tech-Priests are repainting Ultramarine's armor and presenting it as other Chapters armor. Level of heresy is high, but acceptable until actual armor pieces are found.
Score: 4/10

Summation: Game is good and developers should be praised for what they have created.
With enough polish and additional work it would be an Excellent game. However there are several questionable decisions on release which probably are related to business decisions for content which require to be further scrutinized.
Final score 6.5/10
Original recommendation: Yes

Post-Update Review
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is my take on the current situation of the game:
- New Level - Very Good
Level design is great, new Bio-Titan is Awesome

- New Difficulty - Report to the Inquisition -
New Enraged status for Majoris is good;

Cohesion ""Leash"" - bordering on Heresy- Snipers, Heavies, Vanguards and especially Assault are getting penalized for their play style. The first too are supposed to be in the back providing fire support, the other two are supposed to be in the tick of it. -
Recommendation: Rethink the design, perhaps based on what classes do best and how they can compliment each other. Positive reinforcement is better than negative.
Examples:
Knife in the Dark -

When the Sniper and the Vanguard are in Proximity range knife damage and/or speed and/or cleaving is increased

Overlapping fields of Fire -
When the Heavy and the Tactical are in close proximity, bolt weapons damage is increased for both Marines.

There! That one! -
When the Tactical and the Sniper are in close proximity Sniper Riles deals significantly more damage to Auxpex Scanned enemies

Thunder and Fury -
When the Assault and Bulwark are in close proximity power weapons deal more damage and/or have increased attack speed

Fangs of Fenris -
When two Marines are in close proximity Chain weapons have increased cleave and/or damage

Shield against the Filth -
When the heavy and the Bulwark are in close proximity the The Iron Halo becomes a sphere and has increased ranged

Downtime after death - High Heresy -
Recommendation: For an action pack game where every second counts 120 seconds should be the absolute maximum no matter what new difficulty is introduced.


Balance changes - High Heresy -
Armor changes - Seems good.
Ammo changes - Seems good.
Recommendation: Reconsider some nerfs except the Tactical's scanner, buff the under-performing weapons instead.

Report submitted to Chief Interrogator.
Until the Heresy Levels are lowered recommendation for the game is a NO.

Just so everyone is clear, only 15% of the player base has even completed a single tier 4 mission. They made these nerfs knowing this AND releasing 5th tier of difficulty at the same time. Pre-launch the company promised to release patch notes before they went live to receive feedback and they haven't done this a single time. This is what happens when you are out of touch with your player base.

This trend of corporatocracy needs to stop. I shouldnt need 3 accounts (steam, epic, saber) with 6 EULAs (steam account, epic account, saber account, in-game EULA, steam purchase EULA, epic service EULA, and maybe more that I forgot) just to have my consumer rights degraded. Forced arbitration, not actually owning the media you buy, and having to run what surmounts to spyware even for single player, battlepasses and predatory monetization everywhere. None of this should be normalized. This game is fun but I can not recommend this game to my friends as I am tired of supporting this regime of predation. And before any commenters say this is hyperbolic or developer PR adds the technical excuses, just remember, games were fun and sold well for the last few decades without all this BS. We live in a golden age of media yet insist on tarnishing it.

P.S. An extra $30 and I still have to grind just to paint my guy purple?! No, thanks. Yes, I know you can run without EGS, but it still installs EGS dependencies.

McGregor,1,478.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199753875974/,"A fantastic game bringing back all the memories of couch co-op from the early aughts. With lavish attention to detail and lore accuracy, Space Marine 2 sets a new bar for the Warhammer franchise.

Combat captures all the crunchy melee and weighty ranged weapon feel you'd expect from the 41st millennium. While feeling clunky at first, the gameplay soon becomes a fluid dance as you begin to understand the parry, dodge and gun strike mechanics culminating in a wide array of gory executions. Harder difficulties will provide challenge and invoke some truly triumphant moments for your three man squad.

The campaign is a relatively linear but satisfying romp with some great set pieces and characters that provide a basic depth making completion satisfying.

Operations, where you will likely spend most of your time, has only 6 missions (for now) but the great combat loop and AI director keep you engaged long after multiple replays should begin to feel stale.

6v6 multiplayer has a solid foundation with well designed maps and a decent paper-rock-scissors class system.

If you're a Warhammer fan, Space Marine 2 is a must buy. If you're new to the universe, you'll likely be drawn into the grim dark future where there is only war.",2024/10/3,en

Faithful landscapes, faithful designs, protagonists who are authentic Astartes (superhuman genetic beasts with mental conditioning and quasi-religious fervor) and not an American sailor in Vietnam fighting for democracy.The story is simple but it works to simply take the game forward.The swarm fleet is an ode to current technology and what a good group of programmers can do.

""Wokismo"" game and current ideologies of any kind.Faithful to its future historical moment and its idiosyncrasy, something that unfortunately costs to see today in adaptations and ruins many franchises.

Comparable and even superior gameplay than that of a Gears of War which makes playing fun and has a positive feedback beyond Lore or theme.

In short, I could not believe that I couldn't criticize anything about the game !!
There is finally someone who has respected the community and has done what they have asked, neither more nor less.

1. The characters are extremely fragile. The shield is the same as paper. After full level, go to the simplest difficulty to practice weapons. It is mixed with a group of mobs with a samurai.The remote monster was almost virtual, and then from time to time, I still brushed the monsters outside of my vision behind me, and came in directly outside the screen to surprise me.When you apply Captain Jia to say, ""I have been associated with these mobs at level 1, and level 25 is still abused by them. Isn't TM upgraded?""
2. The weapon is extremely unbalanced, and the difficult and difficult hot melt is almost a must -have. The result of the danger of melee weapons is not as good as the hot melting out of the risk of being beaten.Block, the problem is that it can be understood with the professional setting of Dunwei. What about the assault?I hope you can do a good job of balance between weapons, but be careful not to weaken hot -melt, but to strengthen other weapons.There must be a few weapons in the game that there must be a few without players, but when most weapon players do not want to touch, what does it mean to design these things?
3. The judgment of the gun attack is extremely weird. It is nearly far, and sometimes you can not put the face when you can shoot the face. Sometimes it is inexplicably given you one by one. There is no invincible judgment during the gun attack.The first attack was blocked in the tyrant's multiple attacks, but it was killed by the second attack in the gun attack.You must want to encourage players to use this system, but what does it mean to violent during use?
4. I used the handle. I accidentally pressed the ""New Game"" option by accidental picture, and then entered some pictures set by some games in the new game, but I wanted to go back to the title screen but could not find the option at all. ESC was useless.I do n’t know if there is any revision of this problem now. At that time, I was worried that I would cover the archive. I closed the game by alt+F4.Are you funny?
5. The weapon is extremely boring. The main reason is that the weapon design mentioned above is imbalanced, coupled with the combination of monster supermodels, and the rogue quality of highly difficult weapons to use low weapons to make the entire process extremely suffering.If you don't want to balance the weapon, add a groove that can store excess experience after adding a weapon, so that I can allocate the extra experience obtained after the full level to other weak chicken weapons.
6. I don’t know what kind of triggering mechanism is brushing. Sometimes, in the absence of monsters, there are many waves of monsters in the current area, and then there is almost no strange in the next battle area.Does it look at us and then improvise the monsters in the next area to generate it in advance?
7. Locking this feature, I do n’t know which genius is done. After locking the monster, the monster is not only in the center of your field of vision.",2024/9/13,zh-cn

The time of passing the plot is 6 hours.


Preface:
Do not go play in the PVU mission until you go 2-3 plot missions, you will encourage the whole team rink, the game hardcore.

The plot is here for a checkmark.
It is needed only for fans and to get acquainted with mechanics (including classes).
The whole plot is training and preparation for pv.


✅
Hordes of mobs, blood, dismemberment.


✅
2k, ultra, 50 FPS with the initial scaling (the minimum).
6750 GRE.

True, the number of loading screens infuriates.


✅
I thought that it would be possible to flee the “hut”, but here it is very necessary to think about what to do.

Your reaction is often checked.
Make an ideal parrying, perfect evasion.

As a reward, you get an armor cell.


✅
You have few HPs, enemies have a lot of damage, on the most easy complexity in the PVU mission, you demolish 50% of your HP per blow.

This is interesting in that you become dependent on the team, you cannot pass the mission if you play everyone for yourself.

Only Esta can be srack ... Oh, with syringes that are scattered in the corners.

For a sniper, a position is important, because the sniper is cotton and Aim is important for a sniper.
The amount of armor depends on the class.



⚡
I do not put diz because this is an online game.

He is not even bad for the online game, but his missions are “defending the generator” and conditionally in one mission, you protect something from the hordes of enemies 5 times.

For the plot, they could have come up with something more interesting, the puzzles are different.

There is no progression in the plot, all the pumping in PVU missions.
PVE mission is more interesting than plot, with unique bosses and weather conditions.
What is the epic mission with the dragon, which waters the whole of Loku with fire.


⚡
Only 50 gigs weigh the game.
The locations are beautiful, in design, but textures are 2015, because even Assassin Odyssey has cooler schedule.

Models are plasticine, it is very well noticeable in the hair from which the light is reflected.
Light from the hair.


⚡
It does not affect the gameplay, but affects immersion.
She is not.
You touch the barrel - the barrel flies away to the next location.

Huge doors that weigh several tons open like plastic doors.



❌
At the moment, the game has 6 PVU missions.
You pass them all on hardcore - count the whole game.
Then you just have to pump each class by reprising the same missions in which the same script.


❌
Ugh.
Firstly, the game has few surrounding sounds.
Secondly, those that have no volume do not have spatiality.
Shots do not give vibration.
The Topot of Armor is also from 2015.

The music is invisible.


❌
Very scarce.

Big minus of the game.
In classes, the choice of 3 main weapons (which can be repeated in different classes)
And 1 slot under a mile + 1 slot for a pistol, where there is no longer a choice.

That is, playing for a sniper, I can not choose 2 and 3 weapons for myself, other classes have the same.
You are running about what they give you with.

In general, weapons are about 15 types and this is such a weapon
""Bolt-1"" store 12 rounds, damage 4.
""Bolt-2"" store 36 rounds, damage 2.
""Bolt-3"" store 500 ammunition, big return.


❌
Chelles immediately register PVU mission without understanding the mechanics of the game, they are killed - and they are pushed.

We need punishments for exiting the match and a restriction so that the people with 1 lvl do not buy for high complexity.


❌
Strong hack
A rare skin of weapons - the seal hangs at the trunk.
Legendary - printing hangs at the trigger.

A rare eyebrow skin is a white rope.
The legendary is a red rope.
The rope hangs in the same position.


❌
I would like to get acquainted with the universe of the Bestiary?
What are we behind the detachment?
What are these enemies?
Why are we fighting with them?
Where did they come from?

The game has audio-diapers, and that’s it.(by the way, they are well spelled out, in the style of the story of stories, and not someone’s thoughts)


❌
I contribute to any plot.
""It must be some kind of mistake""
""I will not stop until I kill everyone to the last.""

A bunch of clicked phrases that are used in games and films for ""discharge of the tense moment"".
I catch a wild cring from this.


❌
It was 2024, the developers of the games still did not know how to prescribe intelligence neither mobs nor allies.

Bota except to raise you can’t.
Enemies do not trigger on them, deliberately run up and run to the players.
The bots themselves cannot execute stunned enemies and stop shooting at them.
The bots as a whole cut damage and increased survival.


❌
SCM - sight.
PKM - Mile's blow.
C - parrying

I would make SCM - Ulta, PKM - sight, Q - a blow of miles.


❌
Wait until the dialogue passes (in the PVU mission, which needs to be passed 20+ times).
Wait until you get up on the elevator.
Wait until the door opens.

It beats very much on the pace.",2024/9/6,ru

CAMPAIGN:
This is a excellent addition to the Warhammer 40K Gaming Universe. The creative team did a great job at providing a fresh story experience while building on the narrative of the original. You really do learn to appreciate and fight with your squad by the end. I could go on at length, but the Emperors work is best experienced rather than described. Take up your weapon and purge the enemies of Man!!!

+ Combat is fluid and dynamic.
+ Excellent variety of weapons
+ Action and design of gameplay, characters an d plot feel true to the setting.
+ Truly breathtaking environment design ... This wholly immerses you in the monumental scale of
the 41st Millenium.
- I preferred the shield and health system from the first game, but this is fine once you adapt to it.
- They removed dodge rolling, now dodge is more of a standard scoot to the side :( (But effective)
(+/-) Jump-pack feels slowed down vs the first game, but has significantly more utility so YMMV.

The Mogician,0,60,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198851368116/,"Very tough decision for me to give this a not recommended review, but I think there are some glaring issues that should be addressed.

First off, the pros:
1. It looks great. Starting from the bigger things. The game is set on three very different and distinct planets: Kadaku, a jungle world, Avarax, a hive world and Demerium, a cemetery world. Each of the planets have their very own distinct style and feel to it. Then down to the smaller details. There are a lot of details in the game that also breath life into the game and adds to the whole WH40K experience. Bravo.
2. The gameplay is great. If you enjoyed the first space marine game, odds are, you will enjoy this one as well. The melee and shooting all feel very satisfying. Popping off a headshot or pulling off a finisher all feel very satisfying.
3. The story is pretty good. I mean, Warhammer games are not always known for having interesting stories, especially also considering this game is supposed to be a hack and slash kinda brainless fun game. All in all, I enjoyed the story thus far. Additional points go to the fact that the coop missions are also parallel to the main missions.

Next, onto the cons:
1. The story is a bit short for its price. There are 7 main story missions (8 if you count prologue) and 5 coop missions that will help flesh out the main story missions (6 if you count Ballistic engine, which isn't really mentioned anywhere in the main missions). I did the game on Angels of Death difficulty and it should take about 15 hours to complete. If you count the coop missions in, it should take about 25-30 hours in total if you wanna enjoy the whole story at least once. Slightly on the short side for the price they are charging.
2. It can be a real grindfest. Tying into the last point. What it does not have in length, it makes up for the sheer amount of grind you will need to do. To unlock all the armor sets for each class, you need to play 35 matches per class, with a total of 210 matches. Assuming you don't do PvP like I do, let's assume each match takes 30 minutes (I think that's the bare minimum unless you do speedrun), and you win every single match. That is like 100+ hours right there that requires you to grind. Now, I'm not against having a lot of coop time to pad out the game time, but since there are only six maps, things can get stale real soon. I hate doing comparisons, but If you compare it with games like Vermintide 2. Vermintide 2 had 13 missions in total when it first launched, which will ensure a relatively healthy mix of varied missions. Here's hoping the devs would add in more coop missions down the line.
3. Twitch drops. Really? I mean, all the clown awards that went into the announcement post should be telling. It is one thing to do exclusive twitch drops that requires you to watch it (since you can just leave it in the background), it is altogether another to require people subbing and giving out subscriptions. This is toxic.

All in all, I enjoyed the game itself, but I really do not enjoy some of the other decisions the devs made for the game.",2024/9/10,en
Wooohooo,1,11,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Woooohoooo/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

Despite the fact that the review is positive, for me it's more of a ""yellow"" type of review (which I hope they will eventually add to Steam, though I’m starting to doubt it). The game looks expensive and polished, it's a good, not overly long action game set in the Warhammer universe, with excellent cutscene direction and beautiful visuals. The combat looks epic, and the gameplay on a gamepad is really well done. The joystick vibrates and even reacts to walking, giving the character in the Space Marine suit a sense of ""weight.""

However, that's where the positives end for me. Here's what really bothered me. First, the combat feels quite repetitive. While smashing enemies is fun in the first few hours, it quickly gets stale and stops being enjoyable. Moreover, I noticed that the difficulty seems a bit broken because on higher difficulty levels, combat turns into an unpleasant mess. You have to constantly spam parries, and even then, enemies will still flank you and ""make your life miserable."" But if you lower the difficulty just one notch, the game becomes too easy and uninteresting.

The variety of enemies is small, and they're pretty dull, requiring no special tactics to defeat. The multiplayer PvP mode, by the way, is terrible - I didn't like it at all, and I don't recommend it. It feels like it's just there for the sake of it.
The special operations that run parallel to the story can be considered a positive aspect, as they let you try out different Space Marine classes and include some progression. However, they don't add much depth to the game, though they do make it a bit better.

For fans of the Warhammer universe or those who just want to switch off their brain and enjoy some action and shooting for a couple of evenings, I would recommend it. But it's best not to have high expectations, as they got in the way for me.",2024/9/18,en

Warhammer was never a fan, but here I thought that the game became very meme and popular and decided to buy it.The price of course - the toad is strangling, but honestly did not regret the money spent at all, moreover, he gave two more friends.So after a long time I can roll out a full review

Plot

It is nice that to understand the plot to be a waja fan is completely optional, in principle, everything is already extremely clear, especially for a person who plus minus saw a couple of memes with a waja and decided to buy the game.However, I will not say that the plot was wildly impressed or made to the core - but in my opinion there is no need for me.The game is a cross between the Duma and Kveik, in fact, in view of this, with its task, to demonstrate to us the most detailed carpencies of xenos, it copes perfectly, I do not think that you need something more.Although, of course, there is not enough good soundtrack, in my opinion something in the style of the Duma would be very out of place.The campaign itself recalls those times when single games were simple and good, without any homesproof or complex morals.Unfortunately, the passage itself occupies only Kolo 10 hours, and in general, as such, the campaign is not very difficult, especially if you go in coopeous even on the highest difficulties.

Multiplayer

The most pleased the operations in which I lingered for a long time.Firstly, a fairly wide selection of weapons and classes with different abilities with the possibility of pumping everything and everything.Secondly, the levels of difficulties where the highest difficulties can really represent a challenge.It is unfortunate that they removed the mechanics from mortal complexity, in which the armor was not restored if you were not far from the detachment - in my opinion, after this change it became too easy to play (given that I went on this complexity almost all operations in its still old form).Otherwise, here you can, in principle, linger for a hundred, play with friends, kill xenos.
As for PVP - it is, in principle, not bad, but there is no variety of modes, and I personally do not really like PVP with high TTK.In a word - for an amateur.Limited customization for chaosites is upset compared to the Imperials - I hope in the future they will add much more.


In general, the game is recommended for purchase, regardless of whether you are a warster fan or not.If I bought doom 2016, do not hesitate, buy it.",2024/11/4,ru

Combat is fluent and clean, feels like a mix of gears of war and a bit of soulslike with the parrying and dodging. It's not clunky at all like some people say it is.

Most weapons feels good to use and combat finishers is a dopamine rush when they occur especially on bosses.

Operations (PvE mode) while being few at launch is just pure fun to play and all the classes has their own specialty so it makes it fun to try them all and max their level to max.

I haven't tried the PvP yet so i can't speak on that.

Not a single microtransaction or ingame store, you just have to play to earn cosmetics like the good old days. (there are dlc for more but im fine with that.)

So, if you like Worldwarz, you can accept the style in which the brain is loyal to muscles and the false emperor without any problems.Rather, there is no beautiful girl because the character and the enemy are 40K because it is the same development.Zo is full of voices I've heard and realized that Warhammer has succeeded.Thanks to Diago Tini!

Epic Online Service is forcibly installed at the first startup, so if you don't cross play, you need to erase it manually.By the way, if you put it in something other than SSD, it will not work properly
The RAM 16GB is exhausted, so it is better to make it 32GB or more.Recently, in an environment where you buy a PC for APEX and use Discord, it will be quite barely possible, so it is better to add it for future games.

What is the story?
If you don't know Warhammer40K, the story seems to be a bit off, but if you want to know more, you'll step into the miniature game, so don't think about it.
To briefly explain this work

Easy to get rid of because the locust has come.

What is the battle system?
Not open world.The stage format does not get lost like a black myths Goku.
Basically, it is a gun called Volter and two guns picked up, and one melancholy weapon, so the width of the equipment is small.
It's a style that fights while avoiding a big turn, Parry, and fighting while counters.
If you defeat the enemy, the armor will recover, so it will be an aggressive play like a space marine.
It feels like a reflexive nerve, but there is a warning of blue, yellow, and red, so if you use the button pocket, it will do it automatically.
The person who cares is not suitable because it is an appropriate adjustment as usual.

If you are not used to pushing in the mouse wheels and doing ADS, it is a way that everyone will suddenly start swinging close weapons.




Q. Isn't it expensive?
A. Miniature is cheap because it is a similar amount of money.
It covers more than one space marine and tiranide, so it's worth 150,000 yen for 10,000 yen.
I'm too used to free games.(While distributing gold editions with gifts only for pre -access on the 4th)

A. If you do another thing while waiting for startup on the start tab, it will not work.When crashing in a movie after the game starts, make sure that the preset is not low.Since the image quality is different for the first movie, it is better to change it to 1920*1080 and read it all into the memory.Since the memory performance may be low, it is possible to pause at the moment the planet is reflected, wait for about 1-2 minutes, and then play it to proceed smoothly.If it is about 150,000 PCs, it is a cheap memory, so it is slow to load.After breaking through the movie, set it.
Especially in the case of a PC with the minimum request, it is better to leave it because it will be 8GB of memory, so it will be slowed down.If you play with 8GB at this time, you should be in Apex Legends.Please praise it because I bothered out the memory.Praise.

If that doesn't work
Use the tricks of FORZA HORIZON5 to skip the Internet line and skip in an offline environment.I don't know anything else.Anyway, Abust

Lower the setting of the cloth movement in the settings.It seems that the flags and receipts on the shoulders are also eligible.After that, there is a feeling that all data is stored in the memory and loading in the memory, so it is better to increase the memory.
Other than that, I think the blue bear is the same reason as Elden Ring.
You may be happy if you change the EAC's affireness rule and change it to a CPU single core.I don't want to be multiplayer.It is better to wait honestly


This is not a space marine but a stealth marine!It occurs if the memory of the grabo is the minimum requirement (4GB, etc.).Friend memo
・ The GPU driver ver confirms the latest.
・ For some reason, it will not be drawn in the preset low setting, so even if a warning appears in the middle setting, it is ignored and changed manually.
・ In the preset FSR low texture, it can be managed.
・ Low texture with 60fps limit.If you are worried, change the others to lower
・ If you use TAA, it will disappear even if it exceeds the grabo
If it is not solved by ↑


It's about to be a correction or a gravo is the minimum requirement:



Q. What is the strength of Space Marine?
A. Compared to general soldiers, the difference between the dragon ball nappa and Krillin is strong to some extent.

Q. Isn't the gun weak?
A. The size of the ammunition is not a 5.56mm like a common FPS, but it is almost the same size as the ""can with black and green vertical lines"" sold at the store, so it is a super high power.
By the way, general soldiers who fall around use a bullet of the size of a can to give wings from a common bullet.
It's simply a bad opponent.

The person who was a heresy, but he was shooting a shit -don -cavalter without reaction.If you know the strength of that, the partner of the heresy inquisite officer is the play party.I'm glad I didn't marine in the dark tide.The haste was suppressed.

Q. Why do you want to sortie with a small number?
A. 100 Space Marine is a division class force, and it is difficult to increase the number of training so that the development is not rebuilt in 10 years, so there is a shortage of personnel and overwork.It is quite poitizing because anyone as a super earth is not adopted if anyone volunteers.By the way, armor is handmade by craftsmen and productivity is scum.
It is chased and it is heavy and big, and only a few people enter the transport aircraft.
The single combat power is originally high to make up for the drawback.
For some reason, if you are beaten several times in the game, you will die.

Q. I have a receipt on my shoulders
A. I often call it a receipt because I forget the official name of that.You can use a receipt.
It's a purity seal or a pretty seal.The point is the same as a commendation to get the top sales of salesperson.

Q. What is a mechanical spirit?
A. To put it simply, it is a bad operation such as bugs and bugs.Since the technology to correct is gone, prayer is greased and discharged and cooled by leaving it with the feeling of ""not broken ..."".

Q. Is Space Marine a high -tech soldier, right?
A. Actually, if you look at that world standard, it seems to be slightly out of date.

Q. What about Dreadnote Senior?
A. You can beat 205p


Q. Maybe black
A. I changed a lot a while ago.

Q. What are the 18 functions in the conversation after the tutorial?
A.




















Q. Isn't it black after all?
A. So I changed a lot

Q. What is the operation mode COOP?
A. There is no private lobby.Since the class is not allowed, I participate in the stray, host, and collect friends, but if I wear a class except for the host, I will not match the class forever, so I will wait for a match while changing the rolling class.Whether the host runs down and goes down with the participation of Nora, or whether the stray that is hosting and proud of it is no longer down, or to make it a pseudo -private lobby.

Q. I haven't touched the pvp, but don't you do it?
A. If private lobby is implemented, it will be done by 12 people, so there is no interest in it.I know that the balance is garbage with DOW.I know that Gears was broken with a similar concept, so I'm not interested in it.
I'm interested in a rugged arena like Quake, but I don't want to play with a group like a kilmontage that is as exciting as a chirmontage from a recent APEX, but I don't want to play it.
If 1vs1 is implemented, I think it will be done in earnest.


By the way, Wai is



If you don't touch the campaign except for fun.
After clearing, the fact that the campaign is not useful as a means of games and character development is a tutorial, a slightly outdated PvE Matchmaking mode, and a customization for character progress and representability.
The easiest to understand when WH40K is a mode similar to Darktide, and at this time there are only six maps.I think the minimum required is because we are trying to provide multiple types of modes.PvP is garbage.I don't think I'll do it again if I get a performance

The biggest difference from other coops is the battle game play that works with different flow of conversion/counter, avoidance, bean guns, and general combat flow.
For the first one or two hours before actually getting used to it, I thought the battle was a bit subtle.
Timpo, attack priority, differences in play style with weapons you have, it will be fun as you get used to it.
In operations mode, team play is required, and the higher the difficulty, the more leveling is required, and the verbal communication is required.In the stray, Wai was the above COOP complaint.Even if you fail, you can get experience, but I want to run solo and earn at once.

Those who are complaining about the battle think that they are not used to the operation.
It will be fun if you have the core of the game and the operation skills, but if you can't do it, you can refund it.

I don't know if it's attractive, but the setting and the overall art design are fine.
The design of the environment, architecture, and character (mainly space macrinko) will be the best space marine experience enrollment and miniature painting materials if you have a PC with sufficient performance.

If you are interested in all content, such as campaigns, coops, and PVPs, I think this game is worthwhile to the current price.If you are interested only in Coop, it may still be worth it, but it is recommended to wait until the content is a little more fulfilling (probably cheaper on sale) PvE is almost like a replay.So, looking at the roadmap, I don't think this will change, and there are different purposes for each map, so I hoped that I could experience different experiences with the same map, so I thought that 6 maps would be fine at the beginning of the release.
I didn't expect to be six fixed missions without replay value.

In the sense of replay, you should search for games like Border Randes 2 and Remnant 2.

The devs themselves have said full steam deck (inherent linux support) is coming by end of year on their website, and to reiterate, it worked fine and dandy at launch on linux machines.

I as well as most others who purchased the game with intent to play on Linux have likely exceeded the 2 hour playtime at this point and are denied refund requests despite the game no longer being playable, so no refunds and no concrete official statements of any kind from the developer as of this review's posting.",2024/10/2,en

깐,1,12.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kkan88/,"The expectation that it became a huge great “space marine”, a bloody chain sword and a flashing large hammer, and sweeping the traitors and violent enemies, strongly brought the fan sentiment to study with cramming a day before play.In fact, the expectation was completely satisfied.The most anticipated parts and extremely satisfying melee weapons were all vigorous and heavy, with their play style and performance, such as the move set to speed and range.

I was also very satisfied with the way of proceeding with the campaign to go straight and go straight without a puzzle or way.It also fits well with the combat style and the game atmosphere.Each space in the battle is also overwhelmingly beautiful, and the decorations that care about every corner of the corners make it impossible to take your eyes off.The culture and design concept reminiscent of the Holy Roman Empire are also interesting sights.

The campaign is not very long because you can see the ending for about 8 hours, but the end content is separate from PVE and PvP.There are weapons that have not been used in the campaign, and various technologies are added, so it is different from the campaign, and if you grow all six jobs, the play time will increase tremendously.It wasn't my taste because it was too repetitive, but if you enjoy the process of repeating it for character growth, you can usually enjoy it.

This is a very desirable case of Warhammer's digital games that have not been able to achieve this as well as IP -based games.The satisfaction may vary depending on how much of the Warhammer series and the preferred macho characters and combat methods, but I think it is a game that is worth playing even if the campaign is not a game.

shokakuprprpr,0,100.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198245079406/,"The following are some personal shattered thoughts based on the play experience, which only represents personal opinions.
I first released the standard version of the player, because I am my understanding and interest in the 40K worldview, pulling my friends into the pit.Because it is played for the purpose of PVE, before the first difficulty, you can brush all the occupations to level 25 and have at least one set of sacred equipment before the first difficulty.
Personally feel at the initial version.The difficulty mainly comes from excessive damage of the enemy and the lack of medical supplies, but most of the occupations have additional recovery methods such as hot melt/grenade, laser excessive treatment or skills, although it limits the diversification of the installation and part of the game part of the game part of the game.Fun, but with the freshness of different equipment and occupations, there is still a certain gaming experience.At the same time, because it is a new game, I personally think that in subsequent updates, some more weak weapons or occupations will be adjusted.
And the balance brought by the subsequent update. I think it is a good update. Although excessive treatment is repaired as a bug, a series of weakening of the enemy's weakening of the enemy and the change of the mobs back of the mobs have also increased to players.Tolerant, at the same time, make some original career (jail: do not CUE) also have the fun of the game.This also makes me look forward to the update of the second season.
However, 10.17's update cannot be said to be very failed, it can only be said that relying on the structure.After the update, I played three online games with my friends, and I made three single brushes myself.
First of all, talk about one of the new mechanisms of the new version of the new version of the N5 difficulty. After leaving the teammates, a series of recovery of the armor does not take effect after leaving the teammates.Methods, but the designer of the military knife gives a short distance as the cerebellum hemiplegia. A sudden thorns when the melee character is underway, which will be rushed out of the distance, which directly leads to ""melee professions want melee"" and ""remote.If the occupation wants to output a relatively few places "", the armor will not be able to return. Unless your team compositions as a whole combat or a full remote, at least one player will be inIn the state, even teaming with friends will not have a good game experience.
If N5 is a challenging difficulty for a few players and has a certain reason for the poor balance, the next change will also affect the first four difficulties that have already had a certain good experience.
Update the decrease in armor, N3 -10%, N4 -20%. This change makes the player's blood volume fault tolerance rate back to the level before the version enhancement.Originally, players like me should have a little impact, but the changes in the monster mechanism below to make the game experience have been stepped down.
Secondly, the change of the monster mechanism. After the change of monster mechanism changes, the number of elite monsters has significantly improved. Taking N3.N4's purgatory as an example, the casual one on the road may be brushed out of about 10 and one at the same time at the same time.The pile of elite monsters, and the frequency of the attack of remote monsters has been greatly strengthened due to the huge number of quantities.If the melee monster can still rely on the skilled bomb to be unparalleled in the strange pile, then the long -range monster is as disgusting as throwing shit on your face.Elites close to the number of two hands are remotely playing the ""iron wire"" restrictions and standing piles on the ground. Some of them are unwilling from time to time, and some are constantly firing scattered bullets for suppression.Try to use melee, the cut targets are delayed at the back and delayed time.As for remote shooting, except for OP weapons such as grenades and plasma, it is even more impossible to win the strange sea in the blood.The armor mentioned above is reduced. In conjunction with the production team, the money who issued the resources issued by the medical package was left to the mother to buy the ashes to cause the suppliers to be too small.Missing fault tolerance and injury have further decreased the experience.
In addition, the melee damage of melee weapons that exists at the time of sale can only be damaged by the fight against the fight.Melee weapons charge damage to this kind of almost no use method to perfunctory, which greatly reduces my enthusiasm for the game.
Overall, my evaluation of the current version is: can play, but it is not necessary.
As a player who loves 40K IP, I can wait for the update with less content. I hope that the game can be better and better.But for the fool's sword, I just want to say that I play this game because it is 40K IP. You Saber stepped on a horses and shit.Don't play your own game like WG and BVVD next door?Can you see what you want?Where is the place where the balance is perfunctory, and then a bunch of rotten trials to visit the player bottom line?2024/10/19/1: 30",2024/10/18,zh-cn
Macross ✔,1,70.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198162987414/,"An essential game for franchise fans and shooter lovers in 3rd person!
I had not enjoyed a campaign of such a well -achieved game, the story is exciting, the gameplay is addictive, intense fighting, the blocking system with auctions flies with pleasure, graphics and impressive sounds, they go to the compass of the Warhammer universe.

The campaign is 6 missions, but I want to highlight that the missions are long, read people complaining that it is very short and wrong!

Operations (PVE), is the most popular way of the game, here we have to select 6 types of classes, the characters can be progressed in skill, armaments, cosmetics, paintings etc;The challenges and playability are guaranteed, there are 6 different missions and last approximately 30min to more if they extend due to difficulties, there are also 4 modes of difficulties (the challenge would be to win in the last “ruthless”, an abuse of blows imagine)
If they will realize, this game has a similarity in terms of the selection of modes, progress, the basis for the “Aliens Firelam Elite” and if they are the same editors.

Eternal War Mode (PVP), there are 3, conquest, captures and annihilation of the moment;It is not bad but this is not a game for competitive, this to have a good time with team of friends and no more;It allows equipment of up to 6 x sides, I tried the ways and do not generate that adrenaline as in other shooters in 3rd, ""it is obvious here you moves like turtle Ja""

I will put it in capital letters: ""It is excellently optimized""!It gives pleasure that such a game comes out today.
Another success is the multiplatform crossed, that allows you to always find people in the different CO op modes and lengthen the life of a game.

Negative in great ""your DLC"" is incredible how their long hand was, pay for the game 35 dol and sell a season pass dlc at 25 dol.That only brings tiny colors or aesthetics, I am to buy passes from seasons in other games, but this is an up your hands and one crap, I hope they improve in that aspect.

The campaign is passed and felt by PVE and PVP modes: I liked the plot, although there is nothing right there, more as a service and the disclosure of the characters.Again there will be the same artifact from the first part, again there will be chaos and again we will save everyone.The ending is open and hints at DLS or sequel.

The operations are interesting, diverse, with a Reyuz of locations from the company, only a bit of the processed, the epic is more than enough, diverse and passing interestingly.There are a lot of orders for the extension, it’s a pity there are no gray knights.Operations are pumped over the operations, give currency and experience for perks, all kinds of openings opened and other things, you can freeze for a long time.6 classes, felt in different ways, there are tests with mini-learning.

By the way, he finds players instantly in all modes, the ping is excellent, there are no problems with the connection.

On pressing issues and negative reviews of others: there are no sorties, the DualSense gamer is working out of the box, all the chips are in place, there are no problems with the textures, optimization of the top, on high stable 60 FPS on my toaster.Regarding 21x9 - it will be in the next patch, the outfits were written in advance.FSR 3 and DLSS 3 will also add later.From bugs a couple of times the camera flew off somewhere, but it was 2-3 times.

There is voice acting, but somehow it is less epic and made worse than English.But he hit 7.1 sound on the ears with vibra + dualsense and plunged completely completely, the sensations of heavy super -soldier, Impact IMBA.Under the final there, finally, almost to the credits with a riser passed, how cool and pathos was done.

- PVE mode offers a real more difficult challenge and above all we have fun with our game partners!
- PVP is also very good too and balanced but to be seen in the future.

A 3 Minute Review of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. An incredibly satisfying and highly detailed sequel. Support the channel, become a member!


Written Review
Space Marine 2 is a highly-polished and satisfying sequel to the original 2011 game.

This is one the coolest looking 40K games I've played. It truly immerses you in its grimdark world with its stunning environments, attention to lore, meaty audio and intriguing narrative.

The game comes with three modes, the first being the campaign, which is playable solo, or in a 3 person squad with friends. It follows Titus, the protagonist from the first game, as he embarks on missions to take out a new Tyrannid threat.

Each of these missions have you fight through a variety of level layouts with their own unique aesthetic. As you progress the campaign and explore slightly off the beaten path, you'll gain access to a decently-sized arsenal of weapons that come with unique movesets and playstyles.

Space Marine 2 trains you to continuously juggle between ranged and melee combat, as different enemies will have different weaknesses that you need to take advantage of. Ammunition is more scarce than you might expect, and you won't be able to take out an entire horde purely with your guns.

There are many bigger enemies that fight you up-close, and parrying their attacks, and breaking through their defences with your melee weapon can prove to be your most effective means of taking them down.

Melee combat feels great, and comes with a good number of combos and freedom. It also has a very important role in keeping you alive, as executing low-health enemies grants you some armor and regenerates recently-damaged health.

This dance throughout combat was incredibly satisfying to me, and as you get better at it, you really feel empowered. Despite this, it felt like I could die in any fight. I was often barely hanging by a thread by the end of combat, at least on the game's recommended Veteran difficulty. Missions are long and arduous, but in a good way, and due to this continuous struggle, success was very fulfilling.

The second game mode is called ""Operations"", and is also a 1-3 player PvE mode. It includes unique missions separate from the campaign, where you can play as distinct classes with their own unique abilities. The cool part here, is that there is some meta progression. As you play, you can upgrade your weapons, put points into your skill trees, and unlock new cosmetics.

The third game mode is called Eternal War, and is your relatively run-of-the-mill PvP mode, with expected game modes like deathmatch and capture points. You play with the same class types mentioned in Operations. It can be quite fun, but in my opinion, is not the main attraction of the game.

Overall, I think Space Marine 2 feels wonderful to play, and is an absolute blast with friends. The attention to detail, and weight in everything you do really makes it a joy to play.",2024/9/9,en

Khornebrzrkr,1,86,https://steamcommunity.com/id/khornebrzrkr/,"Much like with Star Wars, when a good Warhammer game comes along, you have to hold onto it with both hands.

Space Marine 2 is not an Oscar-winning performance. The dialog in the campaign mode won't have you pondering the (super)human condition and the plot contrivances aren't all that original. The premise of the campaign is even a mirror to the original game's hook, which you could see as good or bad.

But the thing about Titus' story is that you can see the struggle he's dealing with if you know where to look. Sadly that probably won't happen if this is your first 40k game, but it IS a sequel, after all. A player with background knowledge of who Titus is as a man, and who he has to be as a space marine, can see the deep emotional turmoil he finds himself in, a man out of place after the events of the first SM game. The engaging and visceral combat, which is not keeping any secrets about itself, will have you fully believing that every big fight is for all the marbles. I particularly found myself trying as hard as I could to protect NPC imperial guardsmen wherever I found them from the hordes of Tyranids trying to reduce them to biofuel.

They also let you Paint Your Dudes. This is vitally important.

Space Marine 2 is probably the single greatest realization of what the world of Warhammer 40,000 would not only look, but move and sound like. It's had some great competition in recent years like Darktide and Boltgun, but I think this is the new pinnacle.",2024/9/15,en

Forced the third party party.
Omnicia eagerly praying to get off Epic and the head of Natus in the head.

Even if you try the tutorial, it's a lot of fun and fun for 40K fans.
Although the developer is different, you can feel that it has been developed for the fun of the previous work.

However, as mentioned above, except for some game problems that are lacking or unfortunate
The initiative pick catches the ankle of the game.
Even the same as in the local army,
There are a lot of people who are cut in the entrance thanks to the pick -up system like dog disease.
Incompetent and greedy, so many idiots Epic
Currently, 9.5 out of 10 non -thousand evaluations of the game is due to Epic.
Even if it wasn't just a pick, if the 40K IP's works were not those who didn't like it from the beginning,
More players (buyers) and evaluations would have been more

Because of dependence, the entrance cut or just attach the Epic Pak like me
People who don't like Epic so much that they can even come to a game of very favorite Warhammer IP

Above all, Saber Interactive and Picks
I needed a pick to run the game, but I didn't listen to it anywhere.
EGS EULA's unique peculiarity is a problem that is disadvantageous to all of the peculiar pikes
The game is executed only if you agree with the fucking terms of fucking picks that cannot be done.

Like the EDF6, these dirty picks are
As if the cancer spreads to your body, it will continue to bold the disgusting gestures.
Then, by the time Epic realized that it was a pick
There is a situation that becomes natural
Even in the local army
Netizes or chancho -chan, because they are the same cubs


--- After the October 17 patch ---
Since the previous five -day patch, the difficulty of the overall game has decreased so I thought it would be a bit of a hand.
Personally, it became a very unpleasant game
I think it may be that the damage reduction on the boss of the shameous melmela
You can also understand Ospaxes

In the end, whether Korea or the United States, he's a patch with nerfs as the result of his turn.
This is a real problem.
게임 좆창난다 싶으면 이새끼들은 진작에 도망가고 없는 새끼들인데
Not developers are playing games, but only their daughters and the sucking opinions of the chicks.
Big, we've only picked up unpleasant patches, but now it's just that way

If the distance between the fatal difficulty party is dropped
Armor made a picture that was stuck with a teamwork guide and an argument
Hierophanna, which is sprinkled with a dung board covering one third of the map
Like Elead Horde, which is steamed all the time in the Fat Shark's Fucking Tide series
If you avoid it with the quantity of the overlapping characters and rabies, you will be forced to fall.
It's not that armor is cut off when you're hit, but it's a dog that's not the same as the armor.

So there's nothing updated with Volkite, Dark Angel Bullwalk Skin
Even if you overcome the unpleasantness, not the fun difficulty of fatal difficulty,
There is no new grade of equipment, either Lelik or Master.
A few patterns that can't be unlocked by the cosmetics
Power Sword Skin Just Gis

In the meantime, even if you have the part of the recovery restrictions in the ammunition box
Still, even if the head magnification is still high in the idiot deal, the ware to trample the Warrigari step with a non -stop
Bolters have to shoot 2 or 3 shots in Guns, but they have no choice but to dry up 3 times.
As mentioned above, I made a difficulty, so rather than a variety of choices
Melta and Plasmagan's pick rates are easy to handle Horde.
If you hit Melta and Patan nerf again without the baller's upward,
These bastards are confirmed as they are no different from the Arrowheads.
You have to watch what will happen later
At present, it is an unpleasant nerf that is not an interesting difficulty
In the case of fatal difficulty, the Carrie itself is almost impossible in the case.

Introduction

Captain Titus, as a punishment for the ""death guard"", returns to regular service.You slip into the role of Lieutenant Titus, the empire needs you, the tyrannies and a much more powerful enemy threaten humanity.You fight yourself through true hordes of opponents and also have to justify yourself for your past.

Gameplay

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 divides into three areas.As a loyal soldier of the empire, of course, you first face the unfortunately too short story.In individual missions you can improve your class and equipment.The classic PvP mode then throws you in the fight for the title of the deadliest Space Marine.

I don't want to tell anything about the story itself.I definitely want to write two things.The story is told in action -packed scenes and in German.Unfortunately, unfortunately, she is told far too quickly.In general, graphics and sound leave a very good impression in the game.

In story mode you fight in a three man squad against true opponents.The NPC Marines do a good job, they know the way, but you can't really get lost, and lead one or two revival if Titus jumped into a group of opponents too quickly.The NPC Marines can also be replaced or configured by real players.The weapons can be adapted before each mission, but there are enough weapons and ammunition between the entire corpse.There is a change here and there, but you can tell that.

In addition to the story mode, individual missions can be played.Here you can choose from different classes and then equip them with suitable weapons.However, no NPCs are intended here, you need human comrades for fighting.If you start a mission alone, the game assigns you human team members and the slaughter can begin.

The PvP mode is exactly what it sounds.As the real soldier of the imperator, however, I do not fight against my own comrades!


Unfortunately I have to open a very dark chapter here.At times I was so far to write a negative review and not recommended Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2.Anyone who has read so far knows that the story is very important to me, just stupid that game has crashed in almost every sequence.So the game had to be restarted and played again to this point in order to be able to skip the sequence that was then re -established.

The fact that the lumbar churse and even the metal lock on the arm of Titus in the elevator, which is very, very slowly moved, is thrown upwards is of course only a little thing against the crashes.But I thought it was funny, so I didn't want to leave it unmentioned.



Top story told
Endless
Many different weapons
good German voice output
great graphic


Regular crashes of the intermediate sequences
Much too short story






A well told story with very good graphics and a top sound including a coherent German voice output.The battle around the universe cannot be managed better.But stop!Of course, it would be even better without the crashes.I tested the game on two computers and with several graphics cards, unfortunately without success.I still recommend the game and will write here whether the problem is fixed.",2024/11/18,de

Starting with my review: History continues in a certain part the story of its predecessor.While it is not necessary to play the previous one, it can be useful to understand certain aspects of history.Continuing with the story, it has a good way to develop, where each kinematics or new dialogue makes the story more catchy.In turn, the characters are very important in the development of the same story, since something that I like to make this game is to develop the characters of the main squad, as in the first game, giving them more weight without leaving them asideas bots that accompany you in the missions.The missions, whose characteristic is the perfectly set scenario that this game has, the graphics and the construction of scenarios of this game are beautiful.The scenarios are linear, but they have some construction that invites you to explore them and find quite useful things.In addition, the scenarios are quite intuitive.While the game has a compass option, I usually did not use it because of how intuitive the scenario and novel.
The enemies that this game possesses are quite varied and are placed very well in each scenario to avoid that feeling of repetitiveness that this type of games can give.Each enemy presents a different level of difficulty from the other, giving very important way to the change of constant strategies and the constant use of its Parry and Esquive system, a system that complements very well with the gameplay, which is very well polished andYou feel good to use.Maybe on the keyboard some keys of keys could improve a bit, but they are quite well in the same way.Returning with the gameplay, this is very similar to that of Gow, as I mentioned earlier, pure and hard frenetism where we will have the option of use of weapons to Melee, which have a combos system, or remote weapons options, which vary according toWhich ones you choose.Music is another complement to this beautiful Frenetism of gameplay, graphics and waves of enemies.The music of this game is beautiful and the Wh40K universe complements very well.
Although something that I did not like at all is the rare behavior that allied bots have and the little impact they can have on the gameplay.Another thing that I did not like so much is that the easy and normal difficulty feels very easy, while the difficult difficulty feels beautiful, and the last difficulty presents an interesting challenge.I recommend playing it in difficult, since it is where I felt the most enjoyed the game.Another thing in which this game falters is on stage.Things such as explosive barrels, useful objects such as ammunition or medkits do not stand out much in view, as well as breakable boxes seem an non -interactable element.

Similarly, this game takes my Goty vote, although this Wukong or Astro Bot hovering like other candidates, my fanaticism for the emperor prevents me from becoming a heretic.Undoubtedly, a solid masterpiece that is totally worth everyone, both for those who know wh40k and for those who do not.Fully recommended masterpiece, it is a rewarding experience and is totally worth its price.",2024/9/6,es

And now to business and points.
Optimization.The first seven hours, the flight is normal.No problems, in general, well, at all.There are no personnel of personnel, stable FPS in the region of 50-60 frames, occasionally in especially large battles were felt, but they disappeared as quickly as they appeared.What is on my system with high settings, and so it was possible or something?
Graphics, since this is a very subjective point I will be brief.It is very beautiful and does not cut the eyes, which I was afraid when I was waiting for the game.
The gameplay, the good old ultranary, took something out of the first part, introduced fashionable finishing and God the emperor how good it is ....Ahem, excuse me, a large arsenal for killing beetles, both in distant and close range, weapons are very good for my taste, not of Destiny of course, but worthy.Blood may seem cartoon or jam to someone, but it did not bother me, my fighting brothers, too, in the process opposite when immersed, it is not even noticed at all.The game observes the pace quite well and in time alternates the gameplay from cutting minced meat in the forest to a leisurely walk along narrow corridors.At the moment, everything that I saw does not cause rejection, but rather literally causes a strong desire to play more.
The plot, and what is the plot, 7 hours of the game, early still.
A little about PVP.Is that unexpected, great?Well, that is, you most likely saw a PVP teaser, there it looked a little awkward and alapoisly or what?But when you go there yourself, uuuuu, hold my underpants, it is dynamic, interesting and (at this stage) it looks balanced (you can just keep silent about the lobby balax, this is a fiction, the rest is normal).The attack aircraft after the first part, of course, became less mobile, but this is as for me for the better.
So far, as if no minuses?Let's fix it and run through the minuses that catch your eye:
• The progress of the plot, if you play with friends, remains only at the host.That is, if you finish the game and want to continue, but you were not a player on which everyone was going, then if you please start from where you stopped.Thisoooo, very strange.For myself, I cannot attribute this to the minus, becauseI already see that I will go through the plot more than once or two, but for some of you it may be critical.
• network instability and departures (again at the moment).At the moment, you can throw you during the game from the lobby.If it throws up, then you can not count on an automatic reconnect and you have to drive the lobby code if you don’t have a person in your friends.But if you, like true fighting brothers, brought each other to Frend Liszt, then the button to join the game more than works.
• Управление, Да, для кого-то по первой это действительно может быть минусом, так что я настоятельно рекомендую при первом запуске подобрать кнопки под себя.Otherwise, your impression of the game can be greatly spoiled.
Yes, in principle, then everything is by minus for 7 hours of the game.Do I recommend the game?
To do this, let's divide the answer by two.
For the Vahafags - definitely his mother yes
For everyone else, it depends on your love for ultranasia and the visual style of this game.If you are one of those people who love games according to the type GEARS of WAR (without linking to the part), Doom, and Good of War for their combat component, then also yes.If not, I'm not sure you will like it.There is another option to raise the flag to touch the game very tightly, but I beg you very much if you like it, buy.Such projects are rare today.
I will also add one point to feel the game, I would recommend the first passage:
A) In a cooperative with someone, so the game is felt completely different, and in Solo you will already have time to play.
b) a high level of complexity.So the game gives you a challenge, which, I am sure, you can handle it and this will be more exciting.

Well, that’s all, it came out a lot for the first impression, do not forget that the game is now in the early access for those who pretended to the gold edition and above and there may be problems that can be fixed by the first day patch.I will wait for you on the battle barge brothers.After the full passage of the plot, I will update the review.

And remember
- What's is your Craft
- My Craft is Death

Update: Well, after another 40+ hours of the game from above, this time without verbosity.Guys, every time in the first, I rejoice like a cunt who was given a rattle, 11 out of 10 on the Great scale.After the plot, too, there is something to do, but here it is already for your tastes, for lovers of visual porn, the game and on the basic price tag will already be beaten out on the plot.",2024/9/6,ru
cyno,1,113,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199014583812/,"Well, I have an R5 5500, an RX 6600, 32GB 3200MZH, I clearly do not have the config for this game and yet, I do not chial because I had loading lag to the intro cinematics orOther, my game is on my nvme and it's niquel, I play in medium and a little high with balanced FSR and I have 80 FPS.
Those who complain are undoubtedly poor intelligence that come from the famous Call of Duty or other famous ""Game of the Year"".
A game is parameter and in the name of the emperor, learn to do it damn, the game is beautiful, enjoyable, without lag, it is a large Goty for my part.
I am currently playing with an angel friend of death and everything is going very well, it's super well balanced and have no lag or crash problems where I don't know what stupid excuse.
Focus to repel the release date, canceled their beta and I am delighted.This is a game that hadn't made me vibrate and pleasure for a long time.
In short, and I may come back to my opinion, this game is an emperor of humanity/10.
I leave you on this and I leave to exterminate tyranids by hundreds.
Good game and for the emperor !!!

I come back to my opinion to say that I finished the campaign as an angel of death with a friend and those only with a single bug that was easily bypassing.That said, to all those who chip because ""GNGNGN is too hard"" ""Gngngn is bugged"" or I don't know what bullshit, buy talent or a friend and do not piss off.Similarly for the perf, learn to configure your game because I had a single bad kinematics, nothing else.

I add, the campaign is a masterpiece much more advanced than many games, I am amazed with my friend and even being a young scout in the Warhammer world, it was a visual, auditory, psychological feast and IPass overnight (yes we rush the countryside in 1 night hush).Tell yourself, it's been a long time since I had seen NPCs fighting in a campaign, it was great not to feel alone hero of the Imperium, we had characters even without name with whom weBeaten and we loved it, it added volume without being soulless, the NPCs had life and that is not most of the studio of today's studio who would piss off for if can.Today, few studios arrive at the level of this mastodon and it's normal, passion, work and knowledge took over and the money has passed afterwards, that's for me mature studios.

I really thank Focus and Saber for this game, they deserve my money and I regret not having taken the collector.The passion was in order and even for the strangers of the estate is enjoyable.A huge congratulations and thank you to them.
(no I do not lick the balls because I know that there are PS players for that with their """" excluded """" ""so I don't worry about my vocabulary)
My note remains the same.
Thank you for everything.

Good to go, I add a paragraph for a little humility by saying a few negative points.
First, the operations are not doable in private between friends without a pegu at the microphone straight out of the ass of a Necron joins your game and gets fucked.Really, if it is to play with cowards that chip in difficulty 2/4 of the countryside, give me AI, it is much more effective.
Then, the online mode forced for the operation mode.Yes it is a little disturbing when you know that this game mode is a sandbox where the tyrants are less violent than the Mamie Yorkshire in minimal threat.
After that, and that's for Gold and Ultra editions.We do not have access directly to the armor included in season 1 because we must unlock them with the famous requisition points ...
Finally, and this one is a bit more personal, we do not receive any reward according to the difficulty in which we end the campaign.I do not ask for a Terminator or a blood care armor but at least a distinction, a title, a logo I don't know, just what to rejoice in our efforts.
This is a little humility and negative to prove that yes I know how to criticize but not by stinging like a young imperial guard who gets lifted by black Eldar.
I thank those who vote positive and reward my opinion, the emperor will reward you free of charge, thank you very much.Go, good game everyone and don't forget: the emperor protects !!!",2024/9/6,fr

applekwisp,0,16.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/applekwisp/,"Solid game, but in my opinion it has a lot of problems that make it hard to recommend in its current state. I completed the game on Angel of Death (AOD) solo for reference. I played all the operations coop at least once. I played a few rounds of PVP, I won't comment on that since I didn't really enjoy it.

The good is that it's a direct continuation of the first. I was happy to see show up in the game in a role that made sense. Overall the lore, environments, and audio were fantastic. The hordes of enemies were impressive and some of the set pieces were neat. Just like the first I loved using the jump jets and thunder hammer to crash down on enemies.

There were so many things that combined made this game just not that enjoyable compared to the first for me:
The game feels like it was designed for coop first and everything suffers for it. The campaign is filled with generic objectives like hold the location, press these buttons, etc. They don't feel tailor made for campaign experience but a cooperative one. Everything is forced to load to the useless battle barge before you load into an actual mission. This could easily have just been a UI menu.









I assume most of these issues could be patched for sure and some of them may actually be realistically improved. As it stands though at full price, it's a steep ask for what you get in the package. There is most certainly no longevity to the operations, they are largely static with no variation aside from where/when enemies spawn. PVP is PVP, nothing special. This is a sale game for sure. It does so much right, but the wrong stuff just makes the whole experience feel off.",2024/9/14,en

But it's not enough to be a 70,000 won money game.The campaign is long but very repeated.It is a repetition of killing, moving, opening the door, killing enemies that do not change much.Even the boss war is only a reinforcement of elite enemies, except for the final boss, all of them are repeated again.There are some places that are even boring because there are few types of enemies.

The worst is the long -range enemy, but all of the distant enemies in the game are powerful, but they are as strong as the nearest enemies, they are not good at eating stiffness, and most of the long -distance horses of players are garbage levels.If you do a fire war, you can lose money.The tracking performance is also good, so even if you roll it, it will be hit by two or three shots, so the damage will be accumulated.The most fucking sound is Joan Sniff, but every time a developer's parents are curious once.Death's angel -based stamina is also in Grogi to put two or three magazines, but it is floating in the air, making it impossible to see other enemies when dealing with, and throwing a bulge projectile continuously.Most of these babies are paired each other, and when they start throwing the projectile with a stack, they are busy to avoid it.When you get a plasma insignator or Rasfusil, you'll be more stiff except for the super -distance weapon, Melta Rifle, and the firepower is also idiot.There are also extremely small means of recovery, but the ranged ratio is not small, so it is the main cause of tiredness in the game.

It is never recommended to make this game a difficult difficulty.The completeness of the game is not good, so no matter how hard it is, the difficulty is so lush that it is only seen as it was released.The distance above is very large, but the gun is more useless and the ranged ratio increases in the second half.If the enemies are fired and guns, they will taste hell. Allies are brain death, so even if you pinging to T, even if you are right next to you, you stand still and do nothing.As mentioned above, there are few means of recovery, but one of them is a slow speed, and it has to be sink kills to restore shields, and it does not fit for a long time, and the sink kills adds a sense of blow, but if it is too abused, the game is cut off.You have to keep killing, so it is a factor that continues to break the game flow.Increasingly, difficulty becomes a game that forcibly pushes checkpoints.After filling up, it's fucking stupid.Because of this, this game is not right for those looking for challenging and difficult games.The difficulty of this game is just irrational and boring.There's no reason to do it because it shows a special reward for clearing the game with the highest difficulty, and showing a minimum challenge and laziness without me.

In other words, the game has a great potential with attractive design and system, but unfortunately, it is a flat -ranged weapon that is close to Airsoft and a distant enemy that comes out of the fuck.It's better if you have a friend to work together.If you like Warhammer Franchise and you are more interested in Warhammer than the game itself, you can live.

The Emperor's Majesty prepared a lot.
The game itself is very fun.
The campaign came out in a total of 12 hours,
I don't know the Ohhamma story at all
Despite being a person, the immersion was enormous,
The fun of beating the mobs in one shot
To make the initial symptoms of hair loss disappear
It was cool.
But in fact, you can enjoy it longer than the campaign
The contents of it were the operation content,
There are 6 operational maps in this game, respectively.
Difficulty is also insignificant, average, difficulty, ruthless
It consists of 4 stages, so I
I only have this content for almost all day.
In particular, this operation mode, unlike the campaign,
Whenever we come back after breaking the maps, experience compensation and
Compensation for experience in weapon skills just used
And so that you can take a class and weapon characteristic tree
Because you can get the money you give as a reward,
From here, you can feel the fun of growth
I was missing from this time.
(Later, weapons that are often used
You can also upgrade with higher rating
In addition, the characteristic tree that exists in each weapon will be taken
It can be hard because it can be done)
(When you go around the battle map, always around
Wandering around the box, there
Armor, treatment, bullet, etc.)

However, it is a little unfortunate that the evaluation is currently wrapped up,
Fortunately, the reason is not a matter of the game itself
Without any communication or mention
Epic Online Service (EOS) program
Because it was forcibly executed,
This EOS is roughly cross play or matchmaking
Although it is a program used for,
This is rather performance problem or server connection problem
And a variety of technical such as game conflict
Swearing in that it generates an error
I think I couldn't eat it
In the end, the evaluation will slowly recover.
But I personally, I have an EOS problem
It's a problem, but the middle of the middle of the year
I wish the loading screens were solved a little faster
I hope ~",2024/9/6,ko

- Console with autism.(I recommend turning off the crossplay)
- Matchmaking working and at the same time.(It would be nice to exist the option to choose the region)

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 - Review

He had his delays.He had his leaks.He had everything against, but he is finally here.Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 is a reality.Everything that any follower of the Warhammer universe could expect.An explosion of testosterone.Frantic.Intense.Bloody.Wild.That Servo Armor reminded me of Gears of War.Fuck, as the Marcus is surprised and Dom. In GamePlay it is a high voltage carousel with excessive action quotas.A feast of shooting for any lover of shooters.Graphically it has phenomenal planes with a huge amount of bugs, but ... it begins to make noise when we put the magnifying glass on their faces or the environment itself.They look quite generic.Maybe that's why performance is so good.It has a brilliant optimization.Nor does it need too much equipment to run well.The levels are rather perpetual corridors.Anyway, Space Marine 2 is an action overdose, so much to leave in a coma after a few hours.The home of any shooter fan and terror of any hemophilic.


*Quite faithful to the Warhammer 40K universe.
*The return of Titus, a whole stoic macho.
*Ejambres and waves, leave amazing postcards.
*A curious crosses between Gears of War and DMC or Gow.
*That constant dose of adrenaline in your gameplay.
*The modeling of the Servo armor are great, but ...




*The faces are not the best.
*The scenarios seem to me something linear and that sense of verticality is lost.
*Some other pico of solo difficulty.
*Certain bugs or CTD as a product of incompatibility with some versions of MSI afterburner.

III_DarkAngel,0,12,https://steamcommunity.com/id/III_DarkAngel/,"This is another one of those games where I really wish there was a neutral option for Steam reviews.

My review is based off of a solo campaign completed on veteran difficulty, all operations completed and a decent amount of multiplayer.

Space Marine 2 is a large step up from it's predecessor and improves on almost every aspect of graphics and gameplay. The controls are familiar to anybody who's played games that require timing and elevated awareness. At the beginning it stays true to the lore to a point but quickly starts to suffer from ""main character syndrome"" as the story progresses. The multiplayer offering is interesting but not enough to keep me coming back for any length of time.

I understand the hype surrounding the title but I can't really get my head around why nobody is discussing the game's very obvious shortcomings, at least in my opinion.

The longer I played the story the more I started to realise that the structure of almost every single mission is identical to the last. The layout of almost every mission is as follows; Begin after a short cutscene, run through a linear level and kill groups of enemies, eventually you'll hit a large area which is handcrafted to show off the games ""swarm engine"" which is basically a point defence for a couple of minutes which was painfully obvious that it was ripped straight out of World War Z (especially the enemies climbing on top of one another to reach you at the top of a high wall and the whole 'hitting the base of the tower to make them collapse mechanic'). You proceed to the end then watch another short cutscene, rinse and repeat for between 8-10 hours. Pretty much the entire bulk of Space Marine 2 is defend this objective, defend that objective, defend the next objective or fight a boss in a small arena area. Another section it shamelessly ripped off from another game was the dodging debris left and right as you thrust around the screen identical to Dead Space 2 and 3. During the campaign you unlock six side-missions known as Operations which take place alongside Damocles Squad in the timeline of the main story, this is also something I couldn't quite understand, this mode has decent amounts of customisation, skill trees, weapon trees, currencies and unlock paths... to play on only 6 short missions with no variation, hmm. I played all of these once and seen no reason to come back to play them again since I knew the story and what to expect, I also found that progression does not carry over into your campaign character so I was really trying to find out what the purpose of this mode actually was, jury is still out on that one.

The multiplayer isn't something I'm really going to comment on because some people love it in games, others just don't bother with it, I'm of the latter.

Overall the story was... okay. The characters are well voiced and interesting in their own respects until you realise that literally half of the campaign is just your squad mates bickering back and forth about how much of a traitor you are, which in the grand scheme of things makes sense but after hours of hearing it I just began to get irritated and closed off from it. Toward the end of the story there is so much plot armour and so much main character syndrome I just ended up sighing when the credits rolled, feeling more bored than accomplished.

Just a side note before closing; I'm curious why instead of taking part in these epic final battles toward the end and physically fighting my way through, I was instead forced to sit and watch a handful of short cutscenes, one even held my hand and forced me to move in a certain way in order to progress while I literally just sat back and watched my character move on his own. Strange, it's almost like they were trying to rush through it to finish the game in time but I could be wrong.

In summary, I think that Space Marine 2 is a visually impressive title and should definitely be commended for bringing the Warhammer 40K universe to life in the way that it does but for me personally it simply doesn't bring enough to keep me interested for any length of time and once the story is completed and all the operations the only replayability I found was in the multiplayer which personally I have no interest in myself.

Ultimately it verges into a not recommended from me with all the negative points considered, if I could give neutral reviews, I would for this one.",2024/9/30,en

Let's talk about the advantages first
The picture quality artist is excellent, the plot performance is okay, there is almost no bug (at least the individual does not encounter when playing), the personal 14th generation i7/4080s runs the highest configuration very smoothly, the whole process is very smooth, the whole process is 100 frames
Then talk about the disadvantage
The first and most terrible is the network. It was particularly obvious on the 6th of yesterday. PVE tried to start in the fast ten innings. Only three innings went in. The others were stuck in the ""loading server"" step.There are two games in the game that are very stuck and have a bad experience. The only game that is not stuck is because I am a host and no one can add the whole process. The PVP is a batch that can go in but stuck.Can't be hit at all.In the future, this game is mainly the Internet. The official is not good to manage the network. It is really terrible. The players can run you all. (Today, I played several games on September 7th.The reason for cross -platform online, the internet said that the cross -platform online has improved, everyone can try it). Then the difficulty and part of the level (enemy) design.Let's talk about the design of some levels. After playing, I know that the two places of the antenna guard and the elevator chain are purely innovative, and the spit fire and tearing worm will encounter brain insects.Personally, I feel uncomfortable when I hit the insects. Later, I was better when I was chaotic, and it started to be cool when I played.Then the IQ of the PVE mobile computer teammates is very mentally retarded regardless of the battle or PVE mobile computer teammate. It will not threaten the enemy, and will be led by the miscellaneous soldiers. The output is also low. The only advantage is that it is hard.Then the game is not low, the damage of the miscellaneous soldiers is not low, the elite strangeness is highly injured and controlled, and the shield is severe if there is little accident, and then the blood is still less.Go to jail.The last point is the problem of operation and feel. To be honest, the near -battle feel is not as good as the interstellar warrior, and then the key and mouse operation does not change the key position. It is very painful.Try the whole handle for a few days, after all, I haven't played with the handle, so it’s hard to talk about this.
It is probably these. Look at the operation and update after all, and may be updated afterwards. I originally expected the game to replace the dark tide or give at least pressure on the fat shark. Now it seems that the fat shark will continue to put it again.",2024/9/7,zh-cn

Kohelet,1,86.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/barkid/,"Best game for 40k

I am glad that Russian developers have not forgotten how to make games: the St. Petersburg department Saber gave us a chic action.

The atmosphere of Vorhammer is recreated successfully - there is a dreadnought, instantly crumbling hordes of enemy, and the executions of deserters, and obsessed psikers, and the universal paranoia, which is not alien to space marines.Excellent location design: Gothic is enough, there are also mysterious tombs and a wasteland distorted by chaos.

A pleasant combat system is to crush the hordes of tyranids quite fun, and you will see a lot of epic scenes where the enemies of the rod is almost thousands.With the Chaosites that appear later, not so fun, let's hope that new races of opponents such as orcs or necrons will add from the DLS.However, there are good bosses among the Tinchites.

The plot is good for an action movie: there is both intrigue and epic, final scenes with the participation of a crowd of ultramarins are worthy of separate praise.

In general, a peppy action movie who, under ordinary conditions, would receive an assessment of ""above average.""But against the background of numerous failures like Starvors, it looks almost a game of the year.Well, 40K games are stably released, here Spacmarin sets a new bar.

And then there are expensive cards - a full set of 5 pieces costs at 120 rubles, have time to craft and sell.=)

The plot, despite the fact that it is short, worthy.In any case, it does not have 3.14 Darasov, Lisbians and the like, I am only very grateful to the developers for this.
With optimization, everything is in order, there were not a single crash or some wild lags for my 75 hours, the FPS was stable 55-60 sometimes I saw a sagging up to 45, but it was not critical and I did not see any lags.
Unfortunately, at the moment there is not enough operations (only 6) they are quickly bored, but they seem to say that they will add, we will wait and hope)



PVP mode, well, what can I say when you play with friends, of course everything is fun when you went into the solo, it feels like people do not know what a team game is just a running herd of 6 people.I can’t understand why I can’t collect a Pati of 6 paratroopers and go to the PVP, why only 3 people know him.

JKSR,0,207.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jk30422/,"Update: Monk friendship, excellent!Congratulations to the hammer.The update has not been comfortable to return to the distinguished single in a few days, it's great!

The assault and sniper must be forced to fight, and it is exciting to think about it.
N5 is more outrageous remote damage than previous N4.
And the more outrageous special refresh (two Licat+two brain insects in a small space), and you also forced you to hold a group sticker.
The current N5 three people are basically dissatisfied with the editor.
Your teammates are kneeling, and you don't have to wait for your teammates to directly push the map to directly kneel.
You are waiting for your teammates for more than 200 seconds, and the probability of brushing more brain insects and Licat is high.You are afraid of three Licat.
Bullets are often empty, and the two spiritual encephaloses cooperate with Licat to attack and brush the BOSS.
Not only that, under the difficulty of N4, the probability of multiple spiritual encephaloshims at the same time has greatly increased, which is more fleshy than before.

Give you the handle, you come.

A PVE game is actually so cool that the player brushes, a powerful NERF player.

Generally, such difficulties will not be designed.
The general shake pen does not have such a red stone.

---

At present, the game content is scarce and lacking.

As a game that focuses on PVE, the reward mechanism of the game is a bit outrageous.You can only obtain experience through chapter nodes and complete task goals.
However, the monster refresh during the task is random, so it will appear. Maybe you can go to the final node in a certain game; three brain insects appear in a certain game (of course, the refresh of the brain insect is not ending, it is impossible to end.Where it cannot be killed).
Taking the 1st Purgatory as an example, you may only defend the generator once in the 钷 refinery area to enter the next area. It may also be a four -generator in the next four guards to repair the crane machine, and finally brush a special enemy, such as a knife, such as a knife, such as a knifeAx.Remember that the experience mentioned earlier is only through the chapter nodes and the complete chapter task goals.Then in the first case, you have no additional rewards at all in the first case through the purgatory refining plant, and in the second case.

Secondly, the current game balance is very bad, a large number of hot -melt people.In addition to the combat style, the melee can play a little bit, and the other two styles are very eaten.Don't get close to the extremely low kill efficiency.

When single players are playing, the backplane of your map is almost the same. It is also stupid to wait for the AI ​​transmission in front of the control panel. Can't you consider doing it? Do you directly unlock the control panel without one player?
The same constipation experience is that I have to wait for the end of the conversation to interact with the task element.As for the current content, you need to hit it a few times. Where is the task interaction point? The monsters are refreshed there.

It is also necessary to specifically criticize the current online connection matching mechanism. The progress of offline play is not preserved. I can understand it to prevent cheating.However, it seems that the effect is very effective at present.
At present, I have a very unfriendly experience of the unique wolf player. I have encountered more than one time to match the task matching for 5 minutes and did not match.Single people open the task, hit the final task node, stuck, and then the task has 80%-90%. In this case, you should not use me as a host to give meDo you come to match me? Do you develop the game you do n’t play?

I have to mention some other places with poor experiences, such as currently existing and high -frequency -ended animation lenses with messy bugs.There are also Pioneer Claws inconsistent with the PVE and PVP experience.It is difficult to not doubt whether it is because of the judgment of the unable to deal with the unable to handle hook claws in the complex environment of the PVE, so simply prevent you from using hook claws in PVE to interact with the environment?

Finally, in 2024, this game is also a loading simulator.Combined with the high blood pressure transfer host mentioned above, the host leaves, unlimited loading, very good.

It is not an IP fan. It is not recommended to buy without fixed teammates.

This game is led by two European giant game companies. It is developed and produced by the Saber Interactive Studio under Embracer Group, which is the development team of ""Zombie World War World War Z"";) Responsible for issuance.
When it comes to the game of WWZ, then you can naturally contact the in -depth cooperation between their studio and EPIC.The same is true for this time. The online method of this work is still equipped with an EPIC server, so when logging in, you need to perform an EPIC platform verification.
But this process is only verification, not the launch of the dual -platform, and when the individual starts, it does not require logging in to the EPIC account (individual has no EPIC account), so it is a lot better than another French company's experience.
And this verification service seems to block many players and become a pain point for playing.
There is such a method here. If it fails to enter the update for the first time, kill all processes with EPIC in the task manager, verify the integrity of the game, and then open the accelerator to accelerate the EPIC platform. Start the game and wait for the update again.
Update the service to verify this process, only once, once and for all!
When the prelude came to replacing the black watched cloak armor, and putting on this iconic blue extreme Star Warrior mech, the Zheng Chapter began!

For this work, I can use 16 -character simplified review: simple difficulty, highest picture quality, process operation, audiovisual feast!

When all the shooting action games began to design in the inside, the problem of solving puzzles, and stealth assassination to fill the game content, a classic and concise super -booming game was born like this.
Linear process, pay attention to cooperation, burst in one hand, jagged in one hand, shot at the same time, and saw the meat.
Worm tide stack, grenades round, big hard armor, rolling gear, duel for duel, return to shield back energy.
The flesh and blood of seven hours fly, the plasma explodes, the adrenaline is always operating, and there is no brain!
Whether it is a alien planet environment, interstellar warrior armor or the model of Tenlun insects, the art of art is large score, which is one of the most delicate portrayal series of works!
The game design is simple and clear, the ultra -light weapon system, almost invisible development system, low learning cost, continuous operation and smooth operation, and distinguish it to ARPG with ""brush"" as the core and forcibly delay the play time.Pure linear process shooting!What the player needs to do is to choose a career in the outside of the game, and assign weapons in the opposition.
In this way, the rhythm of the game needs to be accurate in order to allow players to resonate with brainwashing, and shout out the words ""Loyalty to Emperor Emperor"".
And this is due to the experience obtained in the research and development experience of WWZ!There are also the game content designs described below.
The clever weakening the resource supplement in the scene, and the number of ammunition that can be carried, so that the game uses the melee system with a melee system.
Cut the knife, you can quickly clean up the small bug stacked stacked;
The knife is cut, and you can capture the executable bugs in time to return to the shield for yourself;
The knife is cut, which can better get the cool play experience of full -screen plasma cracking.
If the handle is played, it will have a more detailed vibration feedback experience!
However, don't forget that remote weapons and throwing props are also useful attacking props, so there is a trigger effect of gun decision.
Just the design of the two attack methods of near and far away, it can make the game more inclined to multiplayer, designing different tendencies, to perform team cooperation or PVP confrontation.During the game, we allocate resources more reasonably.

""Hell Domestic""?""undercurrent""?Or ""Zombie World War""?
Maybe there are, but it is by no means suture, but the experience of experience!
This simple gameplay, the level of levels of the players, the moderate number of enemies, the design of the linear linear no -gear, and the more significant multi -person cooperation gameplay and a more delicate visual experience.Each one is considered to play with the players and look comfortable.

This game represents the best generation adaptation of the game under the World View of Warhammer 40K. Whether it is the picture quality or action design, it is very eye -catching.Not only did the IP 40K, the position of the warhammer 40K in the player's mind, the production team also showed the players to the high level of the game industry again.

In this game, players will play an Astert (Titus) to lead their team to complete different task responsibilities, and their own monk brothers fell hard to frustration from the Tyron Zerg and treacherous conspiracyEssenceThe plot is smooth as a whole, and the character shaping is quite good.Please note that the following hidden text involves spoilers: In general, the plot is very good, just a little short, the single plot time is about 6 hours.

The PVE cooperation model can be regarded as an extension of the single -player battle.In a single plot, the background communication will tell players that the other Astart team is assisting us, and the PVE cooperation model is the team to assist players to complete the single -player battle.Players can experience battles in the background of the same task from various angles.This is similar to the Lyon and Aida lines in ""Biochemical Crisis 4"". Different battles that occur in the same background complement each other, which greatly enhances the player's sense of game substitution.However, it is a pity that there are currently certain bugs in the PVE cooperation model, such as difficulty matching and difficult to enter the game, and the liver is high. I hope that the sword can solve this problem before the game officially launched on September 9.

· The high level of gaming industry
· A variety of action design
· Excellent plot design and character shape
· The immersive battlefield atmosphere shaping
· Wonderful epic performance runs through
· Double -threaded plot experience with foot feature

· Single plot is not large enough
· There are less available weapons and equipment
· PC optimization is poor, not friendly for low configuration computers
· The cooperation mode is difficult to match, and the AI ​​teammates have to be optimized
· The difficulty of the cooperation model is high and low, and the experience calculation method is unreasonable

The game has just started service, and there are many problems that affect the game experience. Wait a minute, I have become a paid tester?IntersectionFrom time to time, the server that is stuck, response, and unable to join forever does affect the game experience, and this game has high requirements for computer configuration (very good for memory), and the computer is a little worse.

The game uses a lot of beautiful and exquisite CGs, but you can't cut the instant calculations directly?And it is more regrettable that there are too few weapons and equipment that can be used in the game at present. A power sword is cut from the sequence to end.Update can make up for these regrets.Another point is that the high -intensity battle that has been around for 40 minutes makes me feel a little tired (looking back on the human transformation plan to take me one.

The standard version of the 249RMB of the national district is a little more expensive for ordinary players.However, considering the extremely smooth combat experience and unparalleled battlefield atmosphere shaping, according to the customs clearance of 6 hours, about 41.5RMB an hour, I watched a super movie. As a half hammer powder, I personally think that the price is worth the price.After all, this game represents the highest level of adaptation games under the Hammer 40K.
I generally don't like to give purchasing suggestions for the game, but this exception.
If you are a loyal audience with 40K war hammers, you don't need to say more.
But if you look at this game interesting, but you do n’t know the background story of the Warhammer 40K, then it is recommended to search for “Colonel Dacci” at station B. The UP homepage has a very detailed background story about the warhammer 40K.After reading it, you can buy it!Conversely, if GET is not available, then I suggest not to buy or discount.Because this game is an adaptation game, if you know a certain battle hammer 40K background story, it can greatly improve the play experience.

The battle hammer 40K can be adapted from the game from beginning to end. Although there are flaws, they are still flawless. The subsequent content updates. I personally hold a wait -and -see attitude. I hope that the sword will not learn the Sima arrow next door. I spend money.Cool.You do n’t show me the throw, and you do n’t give me cool. How do you make me willingly pay for it?It is hoped that the subsequent updated content can be like the single -player campaign in this game, which will bring players a vain experience.

Arcy,1,71.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RoboticCamelid/,"Product received for free

While it doesn't run as well on my 4070ti as I'd like, this game kicks utter ass. It feels, genuinely, like a game from 2010. Both in good and bad. A singleplayer/co-op campaign, a PvE operation mode that has its own separate progression from it but ties into it narratively, and a pretty solid, no-frills-all-skill PvP classic arena-esque modes. A full package.

I almost forgot what it felt like to have a game release as a full package. Nowadays most games release with either the solo experience, completely a PvE coop one, or are PvP only. Most in the former camp have, at best, a small DLC of a mission or two to look forward to, and the latter is a microtransaction hellscape of every-other-month season passes. But here comes Space Marine 2, of a franchise I dismissed until recently, to give me it all. Visceral PvE combat against swarms of Tyranids both in campaign and the PvE operation mode (for a Halo nerd, seemingly very akin to Spartan Ops from 4) and the ability to shoot people's virtual, heretical avatars. And yet they promise more content to come, with a grand amount of customization to make your own little Imperium soldier spaceman.

I'm not going to say it's perfect. There's 6 PvE missions and as many, if not less, PvP maps and modes. But given the success so far and how good the final product is regardless, I'm going to put my faith we'll see that extra content. The season pass isn't a 10$ gate to a cosmetic progression system like everything else post-Overwatch, but rather the early 2010s version of a Season Pass. Which is to say, ""Give us 40 bucks and we'll give you the rest of our content later. Nebulous content we can't exactly assure you the quality of, but hey, it's coming regardless"". 10 years ago that version of a Season Pass was scummy, but maybe my will is eroded. I prefer that infinitely to 10 bucks for battle royale skins every 3 months. Like I said, it's a game that feels directly lifted from the early 2010's, and balance, especially in PvP, can feel a iffy (why can Bulwarks block my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bolt Sniper).

It makes up for it way more in what it offers though, and promises more to come in Marine Chapters and PvE/PvP content, a horde mode, et cetera. Easily a GOTY 2024 contender, and that's not just because it's been a light year. You'll swap from playing Gears of War third person shooting to Arkham countering and melee bashing on a dime, and cover yourself in excess gore as you do it. Easily recommended.",2024/9/10,en

Alekde,1,386.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alekde/,"Space Marine 2 is without a doubt one of the best games in the Warhammer 40K universe.It is a game we have waited for a long time because 13 years after a very good part of the first.With my head bowed, I immediately admit that I beat the game in July when it was leaked but that I knew immediately that I would buy a full version in the maximum edition, it justifies me a bit :) I just couldn't wait ...

Campaign

The campaign of the second part is a direct continuation of the fate of our hero from the first part despite the fact that about 200 years pass between them.It is realized with the expected momentum and perfectly fits into the framework of the entire universe.Blood, finishes or broken members are something that I define war in this world.Despite its linearity and corridor structure, and a focus on the same, i.e. continuous fight, completing it gave me a lot of joy.



The great colossus model was great and used.From the very beginning of the Tyranid invasion, you can see Kim playing and who we control.Our elite brothers from the Ultramarine Legion against ordinary soldiers look like real titans.They are not only distinguished by their armor every size of our characters, real giants equal to Tyranid warriors.The strength with which we fight, a sense of hand and shooting weapons has been devoted perfectly especially if you play on a dedicated pad (I use xbox).Every blow, every shot or headshot is felt and gives not little satisfaction.Bloody finishes are the proverbial dot above i.



The first pleasant surprise is to add cooperation in the game.In addition to the first mission, the prologue introducing the next missions can be played together with one or two friends.It works great and even conquers emotions from playing together.Fortunately, if we play and our comrades themselves, it works great.



This is the proverbial dessert.If someone remembers the previous Space Marine and the multiplayer model contained in the game, it will smile slightly to this day.He was great and gave me many hours of great entertainment.13 years have passed and we got what we all waited for.For MP itself, it is worth buying Space Marine 2.

Arcvox,1,24.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/arcvox/,"Space Marine 2 is an excellent sequel to the original, improving on the original game in almost every aspect. As it currently stands, I think it's a great game and represents the 40K universe very well, capturing grand scale combat zones on gorgeous alien planets. That said, it can certainly do with some quality of life improvements, which is to be expected of most new games out the gate. Hopefully they will address certain issues quite quickly, though most of these didn't affect the game in a negative way. More details on that below.

The game itself follows the story from the first game, which was a fairly basic story about the discovery of a relic which brings about nothing but trouble for the protagonist, Titus. Essentially, he is paying penance for his ""crime"" in the last game, which consists of him not dying. As a result of this, he has grown distrustful of his fellow brothers, which in turn makes his brothers not trust him - along with the obvious fact that he mysteriously vanished for the last couple of centuries. The campaign takes place over 3 planets, while certain storyline events take place concurrently with the Operations game mode, which is essentially another 6 missions in co-op mode, where you can play as a custom Space Marine.

The gameplay is pretty basic. It's very similar to Gears of War without the cover system, instead relying on stunning and executing enemies to restore your overshields. You'll be mixing up melee and gun play mopping up large numbers of basic enemies while eliminating the larger threats, which mostly consist of two large factions each with around 6-7 enemy types each, and some boss type enemies too.

Overall, I do recommend this game, however I do feel that the amount of content itself is a little bit lacking. Saber have made a very good game platform for more content to be added, and I can imagine different scenarios and missions could easily be added to objective mode. Having completed the campaign, it definitely feels as though it's meant to be played co-op too, especially with all the cool cosmetics you can unlock in the multiplayer modes. These additions I feel like would be low effort for the developer, so maybe they will consider it in the future.

Other than the small quality of life improvements and a bit of tweaking on some of the multiplayer classes, I think Saber did an excellent job, and I look forward to more content. The storyline is gripping, the visuals are amazing, and it's the sort of fun gory gameplay that we used to get a lot of in gaming, so it's nice to have a callback to that.


- Excellent visuals that brings the 40K universe to life in an authentic way.
- Captures the essence of the Space Marines in all their glory (though on harder difficulties you won't feel very powerful at all)
- Impressive horde mechanics, particularly in their movement. Climbing up walls and scrambling over each other suits the tyranids amazingly.
- Combat is fairly basic but fun, and glory killing enemies never seems to get old.


- Gaining multiplayer XP is incredibly slow, given that you'll be repeating online content a fair bit. This is exacerbated by the fact that cosmetics use the same currency as productive upgrades such as perk points. I feel like the two should have been separated so you can work towards your favorite chapter AND progress in abilities so you can pull your weight better in teams.
- Melee in particular needs some buffs, as it tends to do little damage compared to firearms.
- Harder difficulties are quite overtuned at the moment. This is especially apparent against ranged enemies, who always seem to have a clear line of sight to your team and make extremely quick work of you while in combat.
- Missing some obvious and easy to implement quality of life improvements, such as a co-op campaign mode, customisable campaign armor sets using cosmetics from the multiplayer, and weapons carrying over from certain chapters. I noticed in the campaign, Titus regularly has his default armor and weapons, which is understandable in CGI cutscenes, but not in the in-game ones. Also, I would have preferred to have the helmets on the team for the custscenes too. There is an option for this, but it only affects gameplay moments.",2024/9/17,en

I always wanted to make my own space marine, color it, choose the chapter i want, play with but getting into the 40k Mini's is hard and expensive. But with this game you can immerse yourself in the world of 40k and be a Space Marine for US$60.

Regardless whether you're into 40K or not, if you like 3rd person shooter, fighting xenos (aliens) with 2 other people, that has a good Story Campaign, 6 different classes in Pve Operations mode, and a PVP, then this game is for you

Pros and Cons
(Pros) Immersive and great campaign mode that delves into the 40K universe (especially Ultramarines Chapter which is 40k Warhammer golden boy). (Cons) The campaign is quite short, which is less then 15 hours





So in conclusion, think it's a great game and a lot of fun to play with friends or random. This game had been a blast compared to some of the 40K games released before this, and it lives up to the first Space Marine. Whether or not this game is worth it for those who want to buy it, is up to you. After reading all the pros and cons, reading review, taking it all to consideration, is it worth your time and money? only you can decide :)",2024/9/14,en
Wuffy,0,74.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013445641/,"As it stands now I can't recommend this game at this point. I paid for the gold version, so I'm 90 bucks deep into this game. I paid a premium for it.

On the technical side of things I don't have much to say. I've got a beast of a PC and it ran well. Never had a hickup. I did have many bugs however where my camera would bug out during a finisher or be thrown across the map while doing a finisher.

I had high hopes for this, being a massive 40K fan. Especially since I would get to play a Space Marine. Or so I thought. More on that later.

Campaign:
It is alright. Not much to say on it. It is so short it is barely worth mentioning. The story is cool, I think. You get to see a couple of different factions and a pretty big ending. The power scaling in the campaign makes you feel like a space marine. Barely.

I doubt that anyone who isn't into 40k would get as much as I did out of the campaign given teh lack of ""Oh I know that!"" moments which was around 40% of the fun. Can't fault them for the accuracy, it feels pretty authentic.

Haven't played it and I suspect that not many will.

Here is where the issues lie. Given that the campaign is over if you blink too fast you'll find yourself either playing operations or PVP. With these operations you have 6 missions. Bland, uninspired. Any misconception of you playing a space marine will vanish at this point. Basic ennemies (Minoris ennemies) will delete your health faster than a guardsman falling during a Krieg assault. You feel about as durable as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient. You deal about as much damage as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient too. Oh and don't worry, you can increase your damage output from 1 to 1.2 if you reach level 25. So you can look forward to upgrading your damage to that of an overzealous toddler if you can manage to stick it out for that long.

Weapon variety is non-existent. You get maybe 4 weapons per class? A bit more if you play the tactical. Forget about playing any kind of melee class as well. You'll find yourself stunlocked. Yes, stun locked... in a horde shooter and slasher game. You missed that weird parry window? Well too bad you're dead now. Good you had that expensive Space Marine armor on right? Otherwise, you'd be dea-... oh right. Oh and don't forget that for many classes you don't even get a rifle or a melee weapon.

Sadly you are very sloooow in this game. Attacks take a financial quarter to complete only to provide diminishing returns. You have all the bad aspects of being heavily armored while not being tanky at all. Usually, games will make you slow and heavy in order to being able to take a lot of damage, and quick and nimble but able to take less damage. Not in this game. You'll take massive amounts of damage from a small critter of which there are around 30 around you at any given time aaaand be slow and deal no damage. Remember from the lore when they said ""Nothing that big should be that fast""? Yeah, must have been something the devs missed or something.

I feel like I do have to talk about this... I've seen a lot of ""skill issue"" comments brought to people who don't like the clunky combat and broken parry system. I have finished all from software games with the exception of sekiro and elden ring. So the choice is all follows: Either Space Marine 2 is harder than Bloodborne, Darksouls 1 to 3 and demon souls, or there might be something wrong with the gameplay.

I'd say buy this when it is on sale or maybe just buy another game. I hear good things about Black Myth Wukong. Strangely enough in Darktide you feel more powerful than in this game. Despite playing a prisoner under the orders of an inquisitor and not a superhuman angel of death.

This game had all my bias stacked in its favor, yet I still can’t recommend it. I played it for 20 hours, thinking that at some point the fun must start. Around any corner now. But it never came. I never felt like a space marine. And if I could refund it I would. But I’ve been punished for being optimistic. If you buy this game, expect nothing and then maybe it will surprise you by mistake.

I may revisit it if the devs rework many of the systems but we all know that it isn't going to happen;",2024/9/10,en

- Do not spare the first -aid kits and grenades for your brothers, each of them is narrowly specialized and at certain points in the battle will help you alleviate the mission.
- Learn to parry and evade, and become immortal as dreadnought.
- It is advisable to use the police in the ""reflection"" and points 1.2 for you will seem ordinary.
- Get rid of the AUE weapon in a new complexity, because you kill your brothers more than heretics. (Someday they will add it)
- Do not run ahead, if you are confident in your abilities, it is not a fact that less skille brothers even take together the onslaught of the enemies of the emperor without you.

Another negative point for me, for having played the PVE missions a lot in the highest difficulty, the choice of design to make the enemies of ball sponges when you go up the difficulty is really zero, they are not necessarily more numerous(a little more extremis monsters) But on the other hand we may have maximum weapons you have the impression that we are shooting with nerves.I would have preferred mobs a little less tanky but more numerous.",2024/9/21,fr

The new opening period is very high and the checkpoint and the story.There are very little to play.Very few content in the game
The price is high, not different from Outlaws and Shadow AC. There is also an EPIC as a leech.
Insert it to get off the machineLike intentionally forced to use or intentionally want to draw any information or not.

The watch of the game is the gameplay system that is fierce, very fun. Performance is quite OK.
Very good, a small specification, not very strong.Enough to playPlaying with friends will be very fun.But if you play alone
No friendsLonely. Say it. Plus, weapons or other things.There are so limited that there is almost nothing to use.
Confused.Is almost no different from Outlaws
Equally different quality, just about Woke. Anyone who cares and wants to buyRecommend waiting for 50 per - 75
For nowBecause too little contentVery expensive

Not long to play, should be boredExpect that the team will develop and update more content
Otherwise, the game should be deserted and dead very quickly. Expect the Season Pass that has been paid.

Multi and PVP mode. Nothing is to go down to the up -up farm.Good farm game
The story seems to be long, but playing for 10 hours. It should be over and unknowingly. If anyone SKIP, the story, the story.

This bug must be honest.Because a lot of this beginningBucks stuck so that they cannot pass the checkpoint.
The time for the checkpoint is longer than Warhammer Dark Tide.
And when attached to one point near the end of BuckThe mission is not processed.Even if the game has been repaired
Still have the opportunity to meet BuckCausing him to die allAnd can start playing again for about 30 minutes per checkpoint
The more difficult to playThe more tired and have to hit the enemy for many times longer than before.

Including the AI ​​system. If you are a very bad Single player, you will be lonely and lonely.
At the moment, the AI ​​system has not been fixed. It's very difficult. I said more than Souls like sekiro Elden Rings Dark Souls.
Before going through each checkpoint with the most difficult level, torture, because the game is like playing many people
And AI acts as worst as they encountered. Darktide that AI seems like no brain.This game is like AI jellyfish.

Therefore, overall, give 7/10 for the future.
Because it is expensive and considered to pass because of the fun fighting system
And thought that his future would solve

Because if not fixed, it will only give 5-6 points. Enough to pass the game of the game with challenges and various levels that players can choose themselves.
And also watch in terms of decorating the character's armorIt's quite interesting that we can adjust to almost all parts.
But couldn't create the characterSo do it for people who want to have a handsome armor.
The same, all armor, of course, of course, just the color and symbolic pattern at this time.

So who doesn't have friends?Add to play togetherNia speak the truth without blessing.
Both the advantages and disadvantages, waiting to believe us for a long time, there will be games that we play and feel thatNot worth the price
Because we enjoy with every game, almost all. Just fun. If not fun, we will always regenerate.

... what I liked

✅ Spectacular combat system, where it is corny nice to kick beetles in the face with an iron boot.

✅ Cool sound design, thanks to which you feel the power of each shot and by ear understand the actions of enemies in battle.

✅ Visually - one of the most beautiful modern games, there is nothing to add.

✅ Surprisingly decent plot and excellent work with a story through the environment, which allows you to realize the entire hton setting.

✅ One of the best Russian game dubbing over the years.

✅ Good performance, which brought only murderous moments for CPU (I have a bunch of Ryzen 5600 and RTX 4070).


❌ The combat system is mechanically exhausted very quickly, leaving the player with a series of identical arenas with enemies.

❌ Only two fractions of opponents limited in unique units.

❌ There are too many visually monotonous types of weapons in which you get confused until the end of the game.

❌ terribly uncomfortable control from the keyboard in battle with unpleasant orientation in the menu from the gamepad.

❌ Nethodom leaves much to be desired and loves to throw a player at a server with a high ping or always reconquit the connection through the black screen.

❌ Long downloads even with NVM SSD.

❌ The game was balanced under the cooperative, so there are peaks of difficulties when playing alone, because the partners are simply not trained in anything but the player’s shooting and resuscitation.

❌ PVE-mode of operations is exhausted as quickly as the combat system, without offering something more interesting than a half-hour run on arenas with enemies.

❌ PVP mode as if made for Rofle and did not even test.

❌ Excessively long pumping of classes in a multiplayer.


Space Marine 2 is an incredibly beautiful and tactfully pleasant game that it becomes uninteresting to play at the fifth hour of gameplay due to lack of depth in the combat system and the monotony of game situations.Multiplayer modes, in turn, are no good as endheim content.It is extremely difficult for me to recommend the game for a full price tag, but be sure to return to sales, because this is still the most delicious militant in the setting of 40k and a good cooperative entertainment.",2024/9/15,ru

Playing on veteran (intended difficulty) fails as delivering the power fantasy of mowing down hordes of foes and brutally destroying worthy foes with consummate skill.

The health regen mechanic just doesn't work - constantly getting downed, scrounging for medicae packs and spamming ultimate ability as much as possible just get some health back the core game play loop. Titus feel sluggish and the enemies are too bullet spongy. The combat just feels 'off'.

Another offer of gaming mods is the PVE mission and PVP, both fun.PVE Solo Operations can be almost difficult, but unlocking various class marines and weapons with perky is a solid fun for hours.

[R.m.K] Gandi,1,54.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/asteg232/,"As a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe, I was immediately tied up by Space Marine 2.The game brings with everything I love about this dark and brutal universe: great graphics, liquid performance and a gripping atmosphere that allows me to dive into the battles of the 41st millennium.

Graphics - an impressive journey into chaos

The graphic is simply breathtaking.From the detailed armor of the Space Marines to the almost endless hordes of the tyranids - each model is a visual highlight.The environments are dark and epic at the same time, just as you can expect from Warhammer 40k.I found it particularly impressive how the explosions and fights were visually captured.Every goal has force, every explosion makes the screen tremble, and the battlefields quickly turn into ruins.It is like standing in the middle of a battle.

Performance - liquid, even if it becomes hectic

Even with the biggest battles, the performance remains stable.I had no break -ins in the frame rate, even if dozens of tyranids raged on the screen.The game runs remarkably smoothly and shows how well optimized it is.It is particularly impressive how things go stable even on medium systems without losing visual quality.

Game feeling - intensive and brutal

What I particularly liked is the feeling of actually being a space marine.Space Marine 2 manages to perfectly convey the force and strength of an ultramarine.Every melee attack feels massive and the Bolter shots have a satisfactory sound.You have the feeling that you are unstoppable through the enemies - and that's exactly how it should be!The control is intuitive and fluid, so it is fun to rage through the opposing hordes.

Atmosphere - which brought 41st millennium to life

Space Marine 2 perfectly captures the dark atmosphere of the Warhammer 40K universe.The brutality, hopelessness and the constant threat of the tyranids can be felt at every moment.The soundtrack and the noise effects contribute to immersion - from thundering explosions to the terrifying roaring of the enemies.You really feel like you are fighting for human survival.

Conclusion-a must for 40k fans

Space Marine 2 is an intense, visually impressive experience.The atmosphere of the Warhammer 40K universe captures it perfectly and offers a liquid, powerful gaming experience.For fans of Warhammer 40k, this game is a must!",2024/9/6,de

The plot is still a simple design of all enemies
In terms of enemy types:
At present, the types of enemies are visible to the naked eye. It is designed in the 8th to nine editions. If you want to see the moving Nona, you may have to wait to update.
There are knives and worms, warriors, guns, brainworms, snakes, big brainworms, dumplings, Licats, stone ghosts, spores and tyrants
Qianzi has red -letter warrior, wizard, church, rebellion, pointed beast, and Terminator of the Holy Beast.
However, in normal play, the worm units that players can face will lack tyrants. In almost the whole process, they are knifeworms, gunworms, samurai, guns and samurai
The stone statue ghost will only encounter in a few levels
And the tyrant is not in the normal game, he put it in many people PVE
The game of this game is outrageous. If you have played a black myth, the mouse inside is also happy, and this gunworm will really break you.
In terms of level design:
I personally think that the design of teaching is very shit, the difficulty is high and long ...
If you want to play monsters with friends, it is recommended that you first pass the PVE task yourself, otherwise you can't unlock the PVE task directly.
The level design is not very clever, and the fluency is lacking (compared to the generation), the design of the entire map is a line, and then walk to the end, the switch, continue to go, and then open the switch.Why do you have to design this.
Aspect
The performance is very hammer. You can see the movement of Chimera, the movement of Ramand, the motioned bug, and the execution.

A review from a person that he was very far from 40K and knows that Magnus did not betray and the emperor is God, but the game interested the universe and I began to watch a little more video about Laura 40k.

Incredibly delaying gameplay, the speed of pumping is acceptable, you want faster - go to the operations above the first level.I recommend playing on the most released complexity to obtain the very spirit of the eternal war when, leaving the great wave of opponents, you exhale deeply what you could, overcame, literally crumbling from enemies.These feelings can be compared with the well -worked out boss from the Souls of Games.
Permanent checks of your reaction will be.

If you want a close battle - there are 3 variations of the classes that are focused in close combat, but nothing will stop you if you want to make a close battle from the sniper, it will work.The fighting from blocks, dumps, parries with extremely beautiful finishing, especially xenos (local beetles), will not leave the lover of the Souls of Games.

If you want a distant battle - to choose from the 3rd class that they can play through shooting and grade 1 hybrid.Impact from weapons - return and entering enemies, it is felt, although not the entire firearm is really good.Hadhot heads scatter into minced meat with an echo for each such murder.

At the moment, the campaign is available for 6-10 hours (depending on the complexity), 6 PVE operations and PVP with three types of tasks.
Operations will be the main layer of gameplay.Each task is a direct corridor with arenas from start to finish, but this is even a plus for those who were sophisticated by empty open worlds.Here is one goal - go further and tear and shred everything that will stand on your way.
The location and number of opponents in the same operation will be random, a random boss with a chance will appear on the difficulties above the 1st (at the moment the beetles have 2 boss, the second faction 1).
Consumables in the form of grenades, cartridges, first -aid kits, relics (self -Revayv) will also be added by accident and the amount decreases the higher the level of complexity.
Geno -sore - the subject that you need to convey to the end of the mission by never falling to the knee to the carrier can appear on the mission with a chance and if you convey +40% of the experience.
A skull with a resource for pumping weapons on the following rarity appears 1 time per mission with a random location at fixed spavna points.
The difficulty 4 passes only either a well -played group of not very strong players or very strong ray players (why not solo will be slightly lower, although real).
PVP is felt quite balanced, but I played only 5 matches, so that my opinion can be false.

Very well -polished game, from the bugs that I met in 130 hours of game:
1) the inability to shoot/interact with anything until you press the change of weapons-it occurs once every 6-10 hours of gameplay and arises either independently during resurrection, or when joining someone in the game
2) Overchil of the restored HP that you can abuse curing the foul if there is enough damage
3) reset cd weapons if you change to primary/secondary
4) for 130 hours of game 1 time met the impossibility of resa because of death in the texture
5) a leviting player can be very rare

The main disadvantages of the game:
1) It is very undesirable to play alone, play at least with randomes, in the worst case they will do as much as the bot.The bots are extremely stupid and the maximum at that they are suitable to throw a grenade every 5 minutes and not die so as to rescue the players and it happens that they stand up and freeze.The complexity of 3-4 solo, without completely bitten weapons and class, without choosing equipment and perks for the mission, is extremely difficult to go through.
2) Optimization in the game is lame, 3080 on ultras gives out 40-60 FPS, only DLSS on the balance sheet or below saves the situation.At the very beginning, even the game could not be launched further than the first cut-scene due to the fact that the game was on HDD, not SSD.
3) there is no support of the ultra of high resolutions, but will be brought in the coming days.
4) there are few content in operations, there are only 6 of them, the gameplay delays when you stop paying attention to the same tasks of the missions.
5) a strange solution with impenetrable textures.On the first mission, if you meet a flying enemy, you will notice how shooting at the leaves, the bolts will not pass through and you will spend the cartridges in vain.Sometimes there will be situations with opponents that they cause reinforcements standing behind the textures of the railing and you will not be able to shoot them and knock down the call.
6) constant loads, to the game, from the game.You will often press Alt F4 after waiting for 4+ minutes of loading to someone in the lobby.",2024/9/17,ru

Mathazzar,1,114.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972499254/,"Edit 10/28/2024 - Patch 4.0 rolled back some of the..worst changes. However, Chaos is still incredibly unfun to fight for the below reasons. They mention things like win percentages, but I wonder if that's Chaos and Tyranid missions lumped together. The buffs to bolters are..lackluster. They still remain the option for someone wanting to shoot themselves in the foot. I'll mark it recommended but hestitantly.

I won't lie. It was pretty bearable at release but.. I don't really know what the devs are doing in regards to balance and I don't think they know either. Everything I'm about to write is taken from someone who runs 90% difficulty 4 of 5 (Ruthless) and has their survivor helmet from the Lethal (5/5) missions. And this is all for PVE only.

They've done balance passes nerfing the damage on weapons when most of the weapons are already pretty bad.

Chaos majoris are the examplars of this poor design. They can teleport around in an instant. You will need to do about a dozen or two full melee combos to down them but, they can teleport away without warning.

The flamer chaos marines are the worst of the worst. They can teleport without warning in the middle of your combo, charge up a dodge only attack while you're still in an animation that you can't animation cancel out of, and reduce your armor and a good chunk of your HP near instantly. Even if they don't teleport, your dodge roll is shorter than the AOE ring you need to flee from but you won't have time to do the second dodge roll before you're hit. They have incredible range but that doesn't matter because, again, they can teleport to you.

And you may think the answer is a gun. But because the guns have been near nerfed into the ground - you will need to spend multiple magazines per marine.

And they did do a patch that made fighting chaos ... not so bad. And then immediately rolled that back partially and amped up the grind by making us worse at fighting into it.

#NAME?,1,466.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056606996/,"The game is Warhammer 40K through and through. Grim, Dark and gritty.

The story is good and introduces you to why Titus got turned into a Primaris well.
For the obvious culture war question: No, it is not ""woke"".

Combat is violent and satisfying. A similar experience to what I recently had with Batman Arkham Knight. It is challenging.
(Countering, dodging and learning patterns etc, but it is more simplified here).
When you play as Titus you FEEL like a Space Marine. The power of the melee attacks, ripping enemies limb from limb. The shaking footsteps where you can 'feel' the weight behind every step. The thunderous boom as so much armour, meat, bone and muscle hits the ground after jumping down a ledge.

Started the game on hardest difficulty, and it is very challenging. Still determining if it will be possible to finish playing solo with bots. Edit: Seems possible, but is very challenging. Would only suggest ""Angel of death"" difficulty for the most dedicated players.

Shooting is also satisfying, but can't be completely relied on, engaging in melee is nearly mandatory once swarms close in.

Visuals are very impressive and faithfully 40K.

Sounds are all great and when involved in fighting give you the feeling you are in a battle.
Music is dark and 100% fits 40K theme. The main theme when the game starts actually sent chills down my back. (Awe inspiring).

After a quick look, operations and Endless War mode will provide plenty of replay opportunity.
Edit: Operations is thoroughly enjoyable. Levelling up is fun and very satisfying to become more powerful with more perks, better weapons and the armour skins are beautiful. The artists REALLY put effort into them!

On technical and performance, the game is running beautifully. RTX 3060, I7-10700K, 32GB RAM, SSD, Windows 11. Ultra settings, native resolution @ 1080P with TAA gives 40-60 frames. Lowest frames I've experienced so far are 30 in graphically intensive portions. (Considering my hardware is not high end, the performance was surprising to me, it shows the game is well optimised in my opinion).

The game practically oozes all the effort and work the developers put into the game and definitely worth any 40K fan's attention.

Some are saying it has Epic. The game makes use of Epic online services. (Not an app, just core components that allow crossplay between Steam and Epic as well as the needed files for Easy Anti Cheat. No Epic account was required when I started the game and none created that I am aware of).

A couple of technical issues I can't figure out, sometimes voice lines are normal, then barely audible (with subtitles it isn't too much of a problem, but if playing without them you strain to hear them.)

The most glaring problem is that the so called anti-cheat is doing nothing to keep cheaters out from ruining the game for others. That alone is enough to spoil the entire experience in PVE and PVP.

Couldn't join a friend in campaign and still looking for a solution. (Will update review if I find one or find the cause). Edit: I was able to join friends today with a few retry attempts, but connecting isn't reliable and sometimes doesn't work. Edit #2: Connection much better. Regularly join with friends now and only disconnections now and then.

Edit: No crashes or glitches thus far with exception that sometimes a save seems to glitch out and you restart a checkpoint with lower ammo, different primary than the one you chose along the mission, meds and health than you had when you reached the checkpoint. (This happened to me on ""Severance"" mission when mobbing me. Unknown what exactly happens to cause the glitch.",2024/9/7,en

If, like me, you are disappointed with the needless disrespect towards canon and established lore by Games Workshop lately, then you need not fear Space Marine 2. Space Marine 2 follows the story of Captain Titus in a way that respects what has been and does not cater to the tourists and nu-Warhammer fans destroying the hobby currently. Any true Warhammer fans can buy Space Marine 2 guilt-free.

The single-player campaign is long enough to provide a story that ties into the Era Indomitus and the previous story of the first Space Marine game. Playing it solo can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, but I found it to be well worth playing and had very few issues with it even though I finished it on early patches.

Playing Operations solo is also likewise a very meaningful experience that you cannot replicate elsewhere. I am ecstatic that Saber Interactive is continuing to develop more missions for this mode. The mission where you kill the Bio-Titan is my new favourite. I have had a few drops when I played it, but otherwise, I have not had any major issues.

Multiplayer is fun, but I still think the Bulwark class is overpowered, and some balancing is necessary. It is not a mode I have played a ton, but I can report no major issues.

A huge bonus is that the usual suspects hate Space Marine 2 and its success:



Another bonus is that the CEO of Saber Interactive is incredibly based:



As is some of their dev team:



I give Space Marine 2 a very solid 9/10, only citing some minor technical issues in Operations mode. Space Marine 2 is my game of the year this year on Steam, and I highly encourage anybody to buy it. Whether this is your first or tenth Warhammer game, this is a worthy buy and entry into the grimdark universe of 40k. Well done to Saber Interactive.",2024/11/28,en

Teshkomije,1,68.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Teshkomije/,"As a long-time fan of the Warhammer 40K universe and someone who enjoyed the original Space Marine, Space Marine 2 has completely blown me away!

From the moment I stepped into the boots of Captain Titus once again, I was hooked. The combat is absolutely brutal in all the best ways. Whether you're smashing through hordes of Tyranids with a chainsword or mowing them down with bolter fire, the action is fast, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. The melee and ranged combat balance feels perfect, and pulling off those savage executions never gets old.

The visuals are a massive leap forward compared to the first game. The environments are gritty and detailed, really capturing the grimdark essence of the 40K universe. Whether you’re fighting in ruined cityscapes or alien-infested hives, it all looks stunning and immersive.

One of the biggest highlights for me is the coop multiplayer. Playing with friends and unleashing the wrath of the Emperor as a team is an absolute blast. The teamwork and coordination required to survive against the swarms of enemies really elevates the experience, making it feel like you’re part of a true Space Marine squad.

Gameplay 9/10

Frantik,1,12.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkFrantik/,"A pleasant, even sentimental journey to the PS360 era, when most of the action games focused on a single player was free of unnecessary quirks and tons of distractions.In such a spirit, in combination with a modern setting, a Space Marine 2 was created.

From the first moments in the campaign you can feel that the game knows what he wants to be and offers it exactly.The fight is fleshy and honey, and at the same time simple but not coarse and is satisfactory.Even the development of the character does not distract our attention, and the finders are residual (audiologies, which, moreover, are easy to overlook).

Positive impressions are complemented by a well -dedicated, heavy atmosphere of Warhammer 40K and sometimes a noticeably monumental scale of events, whose feeling is also significantly helped by clouds of opponents, sometimes consisting of hundreds of individuals who can create ""live towers"" in the image of those from World War Z.

Gameplay, Gears fans will feel here at home, because with the exception of hiding behind the shields, they will get everything they liked the series from Microsoft.The protagonist and other space marines are the right gigachades, although they can feel their fanaticism here more than testosterone.
On the minus SM2, in turn, there is a smaller variety of gameplay.We run, shoot, chop or break or dodge - only so much, not counting two quite short moments when we get a jetpack that allows temporary rising into the air.It is a pity that you would even ask for some sights on the board of combat machines, which we see the whole fan during the story.

When shooting and chopping to the glory of the Emperor, you immediately feel that we are powerful.Smaller enemies explode like sacks with a wound, those slightly bigger quickly recognize our superiority, letting themselves be cut into pieces - we have a system of executions similar to that of modern dooms - a properly softened adversary catches Stuna and for a while is susceptible to an effective finisher that renews usSomething like armor or maybe more strength field.Interestingly, the same does not apply to the health belt - here we are addicted to finding first aid kits, which are quite few.
8-10h, which should be devoted to completing the single, can be extended with co-optic missions for about 30-45 minutes each.They are strongly related to feature events and, although various Unlocks are present there, they do not give the impression of a gaas shell.There is also a PvP mode, but I don't have much to say about it.It is a pity that the premiere lacked Horda mode.It is to be added there

Solid 8/10 and recommended from me, for everyone who longed for spectacular action and fleshy shooting.Even without knowing the WH 40K universe, you can play here without a problem (I only know so much that there are space marines who have God-Iperator and fight heresy and probably all other breeds of the universe, orcs or tyrandas).But it should be noted that Space Marine 2, just like the first part, does not explain anything from the world presented to us, leaving everything in our curiosity and ...

Non -war hammer 40K fans are cautious, fighting is actually average, ordinary standards.It is not a brainless and refreshing shooting game, you need to understand and operate.The balance between weapons and careers is not good, and some weapons and occupations are too weak.
At the same time, the main problem is that the current volume is not in line with pricing. PVE is about 5 main line battles and 6 copies.

MrMarionette14,0,29.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMarionette14/,"There are big problems in combat design.None of the simplest values ​​to the lowest bottom combat interaction.The production team wants to combine melee remote and other combat methods, but the result is all pulling.
Most of the battles in the game are given a large space and then brushed a large number of enemies with a large amount of reunification, but the performance of the player's role is not enough to clear the melee enemies or in turn.Compared with the high -pressure worm nest or chaos, players' weakness of solution is not worth mentioning, and the empty venue design and powerlessness of remote attacks even make the player unable to do it. Slowness is dead.
The reverse feel is very strange. According to the prompt button, it may not be able to play perfectly. The overall judgment highlights a mystery, and the humorous gun is decided to control itself for a second.At the same time, defense or dodge cannot interrupt the current attack action in the battle, and I don't know if it is BUG or what.And even so, elite enemies often appear to cooperate with attacks, and the hard straight after the rebound was attacked by other elite monsters.
In addition, the hard -straight mechanism is also very disgusting. If the attacking is hard, it will cause it to be suppressed when facing multiple enemies or specific joint moves.
The poor supply in the level is poor. I do n’t know if it is difficult for the action mode to be able to pick up 4 medical packages from beginning to end: this is almost the need for a character's blood volume.
The enemy's attack method is also very against the sky. Most of the long -range elites can hardly attack the attack to change the blood, especially the brainworm is the most outrageous.As a BUFF, an enemy with a large range of remote attacks and flying one has a thick outrageous blood volume, which is pure against the sky.Get priority. If there are too many blood, it will not be dropped. Finally, it will be processed. It will BUFF other enemies, and will use high -frequency attacks to force players to dodge.
In addition to judging mystery, BOSS is relatively small. In addition to the enhanced brainworm BOSS on the main line, most of the AOE is too much other than the sky.
The summary is that the battery life and control methods of players are very weaker than the 1st generation, but the enemy has increased a lot in both the number and strength.The enemies in the face surpassed the player's performance battle experience.
Although I think the dark tide is also a spam game, I think Saber should go to play 500 hours of dark tide and redesign this game.
See how the dark tide is done:
In a complex environment, players have bunkers and corners to rely on and let the enemy gather in the same place.Melee enemies will block the gun line of the remote enemy.Players have a strong skill to solve the field, and have a sliding shovel to avoid long -range attacks.
There are fixed medical stations in the level, fixed number of medical boxes and supply boxes, as well as randomly distributed medical needles and ammunition.Regardless of enough, at least not so digging.
The enemy design may be the best place for dark tide. Although it has appeared because of the value, the overall performance is in a reasonable range due to the value of the sky or a machine gunner.
The dark tide BOSS is relatively not too colorful, but it is still not inferior to Star Warrior 2. At least there is nothing to rely on invincible frames to hide from the sky full -screen AOE.
Considering that the dark tide is not the first to make, my evaluation is the future.At present, no one is recommended (unless you really like the IP 40K IP and have good tolerance for the garbage system) before the production team is greatly modified.",2024/9/8,zh-cn

Mammothmk2,0,19.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mammothmk2/,"The battle has been connected and the cooperation is playing. The advantages of this game are lacking, but there are a few more serious problems. We will say:
advantage:
1. Hammer is looking forward to the current product of the present, if you are a Hammer, most of the elements in it can be known, and there are no games that can be so restored at present.
2. It is indeed the production team of the Zombie World War. There is really a set of ways to perform enemy clusters.
3. Fighting performance, the performance of the ending skills is very good, and the feedback of the strike is very cool.
shortcoming:
1. The game encourages melee. After all, the melee is returned to the shield, and the end technique is invincible, but the feedback reward is too bad, and the return of the shield is a little bit. The difficulty in the early stage is okay.When you play down, the game also lacks effective AOE methods. In addition to the flying sledgehammer, grenades, and skills, once surrounded, it is basically sent.What, do you say that the bomb is reversed and fighting?Which blue and red circle full of screens, which one do you fight?Not to mention that there are CDs, you also need to be aimed at the enemy, and the enemy with a long -distance black gun needs to be aimed at.Rolling people are very common.
2. Weapon problem, to be honest, the weapon of this game is so few beyond pointing, don't get me wrong, I am talking about the weapon that can be used, a dazzling shotgun, but in fact it is the balance of the value of the value of the magazine, the rate of fire rate,Therefore, basically it is a pile of fire speed, magazine, and uneven range of shotguns, which are essentially nourishing guns, low and funny.Not to mention that you are a Astert, the recoil and aiming are so outrageous, and the scatter is the same as the shotgun.The useful weapons are hot -melt, plasma, and snails such as killing large weapons.I can't see that there are few ammunition supplies, and they are still scattered, and the character treatment methods are scarce. The broken grenades of the main AOE weapon can only bring 3 eyes.The arsenal of cloak cockroaches is much richer than you Astert.
3. Level design and task. If you have played the zombie world war, you will find that this is essentially the mission template of the zombie world war.It is not necessary to describe it. It is essentially the set of brushes, skill trees, weapons unlocking, etc. of the zombie world war.The growth rewards are also bad. Basically, only in the later period can I experience the refreshing sense of the emperor's possession.The duplication is serious, resulting in lack of good content and tasteless.The world view of 40K is very large. I just hope that the production team can launch new content in time in the future. The current content is completely worth 200+.
4. The game does not talk about the content. First of all, as a 24 -year game, it does not support HDR, and does not support wide screens. This is incredible.It shouldn't.As for the Internet, this kind of PVE PVP game is always talked about. It is not surprising that teammates ghost animals are not surprised. I do n’t have too much evaluation here.As for the small blue bear anti -cheating?In addition to the disgusting players themselves, this stuff is the same as the anti -cheating aspect. As soon as the PVP result of the PVP was opened, the invincible shields were entered.
All in all, unless you are a loyal hammer, I suggest 200+ or ​​don't spend it. The Mid -Autumn Festival is approaching. Personally, I still recommend that you buy a moon cake gift box to honor your friends to condolence.",2024/9/8,zh-cn

Today we had another patch that reversed said changes, and after playing for a few hours, I can honestly say that Space Marine 2 is back in a good position again. This is of course subjective, but I am clearly not alone having this viewpoint.

In its current state SM2 is gory, engaging, testosteronie- filled fun. I usually stick to various RPG, and haven't really enjoyed a shooter (if you can even call it that) since Battlefield 1942.

I can't stop playing this though.

You have a campaign, which takes about 7 hour'ish to complete. While that might sound short, it is highly entertaining. The quality is top notch. At least I was having a blast blasting, hacking and swordchainsaw'ing my way through it.

Than you have the online part. As someone who is generally burned out of online games, this still has hooked me. You have PvE coop missions, called operations, where you and 2 fellow Space Marines clear out 1 of 7 maps. You can chose between 5 difficulties. The lowest one being very easy, the hardest one .. well.. hard.

I could probably write an essay about this game, but bottomline:
This is my years Baldurs Gate 3. Totally different genres, but both are game of the year content for me.

Here are some of my personal opinions. Although I feel that this game is developed like a semi -finished product, but the potential of this platform is still there.The 40K world is so large in size. This tank armored vehicle endowner is fearless of various models and Titan. Are the game content waiting for you to develop the skin of each battle group.I see that there are also suggestions for a multi -person battlefield mode to cast these contents into the online player.The battlefield mode game balance will be done well and there will be a group of long -term players.So many races in the war hammer world are enough to develop to the old sea of ​​the sky.I believe that in addition to loyal players and chaos, there is a large number of players who want to experience the magical battle with the second brother of Mao to experience the magic battle of Mao Mao!Imagine that Lakart killed as invisible to cut SM as the samurai as a samurai, like cutting melon and cutting vegetables, and eating hungry.If you want to follow the intentions of the upper and more good ways to conquer the universe, or find that the home is taught by the family to be taught by the machine, you must know that the hammer friends have not only players who are loyal to various race forces.You can also develop a single -headed mode or the battle flag mode, etc.
Passers -by players who are not hammers still recommend that they are discounted when they are squatting.
I am a Die Hard Fan Who Immediaately Rushed to Luxury. After watching the trailer, I was almedy looking forward to it, and after watching the trial, I was ever ! Finally, when I was able to play, I enCountered Numerous DifficultiesFrom downloading, installing, to the size epic and subspace server, and managed to finish the plot in the first place. That the Advantages and Disadvantages of the Game You Made Are Basically The Same ASThose of World War of Zombies, with too little content. But there is one differentce, The 40k World Volume of Warhammer Makes Me Feel Like I Spent 399 TO BUY A DLC. t's just a multiplayer task that can be played for a while,But with only six maps, it wON'T last long. It can only be said that the future is promising.

Cons
-Comes out with DLC already being advertised
-Poor servers that lag (even during single player)
-Single player story is around 8h on hardest difficulty
-PvP mode is bare bones with painfully slow progression that locks any real customisation with high levels (not to mention you can only customise your look half the time as you're forced to wear heretic armour during half the matches which you can't customise)
-Loading screens on loading screens on loading screens (You might think I'm exaggerating to emphasise but you will have to do a loading screen to go into another loading screen for all multiplayer modes)

Pros
-Looks cool, visuals are really nice
-Its warhammer 40k

Kyreek,0,130.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012430085/,"I love the universe of Warhammer 40K, I loved the first opus and the first previews of this Space Marine 2 were rave so I rushed: pre -order, ultra collector edition etc ...

And in the end, after 8 hours of play: a big ""mouais"" ...

Yes, the lore is faithful, yes, it's ultra nag, yes, it's pretty but ... that's all.

Besides that, the game is not super well optimized on PC, it is heavy and confused to handle, very repetitive, the PVP is very low on the content and finishes, the menus are painful and everything is sorely lacking in Qol..orks).

Suddenly, forget any notion of precision or headshots: the commitments are always the same with hordes of teeming critters that rush to you, we swing two, three bastos at a distance to clear the first rows but as the enemies are anywayToo numerous and fast, that the ""superior"" tyranids are too resistant (and that we are quickly short of ammunition in addition to recharging which takes a lead), it invariably ends up clearing up the chainsaw sword with a few parades/dodges not hyper intuitive.

So, it's very faithful to the Lore, huh.But it's flat and redundant.

And yet, I want to love this game, I love the universe and everything but in the end it is a bit of a cold shower.I read the opinions here and there that talk about the game of the year, an epic shooter etc ... And I wonder if we play well in the same game: Space Marine 2 is not a dung but clearly it does notNot worth all the superlatives we hear about him and it's not worth € 60 either (and even less the price in collector but hey here, I made myself have, that's life).



The countryside:
+ Pleasant with a few moments of bravery well felt
+ A short hair but it remains suitable

- zero desire to redo it once finished

Operations mode:
+ Nice concept which takes up the countryside but from a different angle
+ Upgrade system and nice talent tree
+ The different well -done classes and their gameplay that changes a little

- a repetitive hair when you go up several LV 25 characters
- Draft like a god for 25 min, have 3 seconds of inattention and have been opened in half in Ruthless level, what a pleasure
- Too frequent server connection errors, it's really not serious

PVP:
+ Simple and efficient, old -fashioned
+ Accessible to everyone (huge hitboxes, no leap out of class assault, no slide/covered, 3 maps to remember ...)
+ Light MOBA/HERO Shooter Sympa
+ All classes bring something

- stupid matchmaking that systematically puts the biggest LV together vs LV 3
- We can spend 2 days being able to play only the chaos marine space which are visually horrible/low poly/not customizable (like reviving the matchmaking between each game and still finishing on the chaos, I have never seen such a thing...)
- People who get stuffed while the PVP is simple, the tactical who never scan enemies, the teammates who look at the area but who are not going on it, it is crazy (even if it's not the fault of the game))
- The respawns: a blow, it's 3 seconds, a blow, it's 8 seconds, at the pif ...

Michelle,1,23,https://steamcommunity.com/id/coastalmichelle/,"Product received for free

I've already gotten to play a quite a bit as I received early review access for my podcast, so I can confidently say this game is worth the time of any Warhammer fan. Saber did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of 40k - the setting, story, sound design, and overall atmosphere are all very well done with an emphasis on attention to detail. Plus they simply nailed both the look and the intensity of ""the swarm"" (much better than Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Helldivers, or even Doom).

Likewise, the combat never gets boring, as you chain endless combos of guns and melee into satisfying executions. The campaign is solid and can be played solo or co-op. The operations mode (which plays a bit more like Vermintide or Darktide missions) has endless ways to customize your character - both with gameplay perks and weapon upgrades, but also a nice cosmetic progression system. There are also class trials to hone your skills and try out the various flavor of marine that best suits your tastes.

I'm looking forward to checking out Eternal War (the PvP mode) now that the game has launched to the general public. All in all it's just a fun game you should get together with the boys and play (or just ride a bunch of cool elevators together, there are a lot in this game).

Note: The 21:9 support wasn't in when I tried it yet, so hoping that comes in the Day 1 patch, as well as a fov slider. I know you want us to feel like big hulking dudes right in the mix, but letting us pull out JUST a little bit might be good so I can see more of the big beautiful world of Warhammer.",2024/9/6,en
✞ImKingJawn✞,0,62.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ImKingJawn/,"I cannot fathom in any way shape or form that Focus would decide that the game is entirely too easy. It comes as a very odd notion when you are constantly fighting an uphill battle for Armory Data, to become stronger, to make things easier. The entire premise of the games progression for operations was to complete operations, become stronger, and steamroll. What is the purpose of the entire progression system if the devs want to pull the rug out from beneath you? There genuinely isn't a good reason to have the entire progression system there in order to become stronger, just for the developers to decide that it's ""too easy"" and nerf everything. Genuinely the only people this system hurts is newer, non maxed out players. Because everyone with the maxed out weapons, perk trees, and levels already have the experience required to interchange their loadouts to make the game easier. It appalls me that a powerfantasy PVE game didn't see how these changes ruined Helldivers to a nigh irreparable state. Nerfing the Melta bomb, by SEVENTY PERCENT against the one boss people like saving it for? Ridiculous. Sure, some people on Youtube made it one-shot the Hive Tyrant. That doesn't mean that everyone plays like that. The fun thing about Space Marine 2 is build variety, and the more you nerf certain things the more that is taken away. To return to my former statement about Helldivers, that exact thing is what killed the game for me. I can't enjoy the game where I feel pressured to play the exact same way as everyone else because that is manageable and the way I like playing isn't. The game hasn't reached that point yet, thankfully. But this patch is a clear tell in that direction.",2024/10/17,en

But as a solo player going through the campaign on the recommended (albeit second hardest) difficulty, this game feels absolutely terrible to play. You have the two worst AI squad mates I have ever had the displeasure to call battle brothers, with the most useless and unforgiving ""armor"" system imaginable. Is it playable? Absolutely. Is it gratifying in difficulty to carry the bots through every mission while they exist only to throw some mostly ineffective bullets around and revive you (which will occur often)? No.

I do not even feel good getting better at the game sometimes, because it feels like I am competing against the actual combat system more than the enemies. So much of this game is made to be a flowing combat experience of dodging, slashing, and parrying, but often it just isn't. You get stuck in animations. You get notifiers of enemy attacks only like 1/3rd of the time. You get rewarded for parrying and playing it slow, but that just isn't effective when you're also getting swarmed by mooks that CHEW through you if you aren't constantly swinging, which paired with the aforementioned stuck in animations makes you take SO much unnecessary damage. Damage you barely heal from without wasting your ultimate with a lengthy cooldown, or frivolously utilizing the very scant med packs.

Rant aside, the game is genuinely good when it's good and when playing with actual people it's even better. Which is lucky considering the PvE and PvP are the main long term focus of the game. But as a solo player just enjoying the story at present, it is one of the worst experiences I have had playing a campaign.",2024/9/6,en
Carbonara?,1,41.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014942266/,"Finally a game that is stable at launch, with content and without particular bugs that ruin its experience.I recently finished the campaign, perfectly in Warhammer style, without very particular twists and very linear but enjoyable immediately.Simple but finished gameplay that from satisfaction.The PVP mode is the same, simple but that it manages to involve, it is not too demanding but if you have a team, you can take away satisfactions on a tactical level.Graphically very beautiful and I must say, also optimized well.GPU and CPU do not go boiling, everything turns well.I repeat, it wasn't a game of day one without problems without problems, a finished product.Not the usual exit that proves to be a half casino between server and optimization and then discovering that there are no pieces, you have to wait for DLC and anything else.I highly recommend it.

Sore note:

The campaign has no matchmaking unfortunately therefore either you have a friend (who advises you absolutely, it is much more fun) or you will have to entrust yourself to the bots who unfortunately are everything except intelligent and in some moments, there is really to blaze because notThey manage to give priority to dangerous enemies and unfortunately you will happen to die very badly even a bit because of them.

Mini Tip for the campaign and for the operation (PVE):

Around the map, you will find green speakers with the icon of a sword or something, well: destroy them, because inside you will find strokes, stimulating and sometimes even temporary upgrades to the armor.It looks like a bullshit but when I casually discovered it, it was a nice saved at high levels with the bots;especially for stimulants.

i pretty much exclusively play the operations Mode, as i did the Hordemode in SM1.
and i do not like where the Patch Trend is going.

right now you require Armory Data (upgrade item) from Difficulty 3 and 4 if you wish to Upgrade your weapon and/or Advance the weapons Perktree.
so if you struggle on Dif. 2, you have to fight through an EVEN HARDER mission(Dif3) to upgrade your weapon to a point where you can enjoy Dif.2

the Perktree has the same issue, you need to unlock and max out each weapon in the Weaponclass to max out the Perks related tot he weapon. some of them completely altering attacks (Combat Knife) or adding additional Attacks (Thunder Hammer)
so to enjoy the weapon to the fullest you are forced to play a Dif you may not enjoy.

with Patch 3 they adjusted the Difficulty in a good way. Patch 3 made the Assault Class playable for non-sweaty people. i greatly appriciated that. but Patch for went in the other direction, including such sentences as ""too easy"" from the Devs.

that sounds like this game will not develop in a direction i will enjoy.
and until i see a different trajectory i will leave this as a ""Not recommended"" review.

Spike Greene,0,99.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102025146/,"As a casual player who was challenged (in a good way) by higher difficulties before the recent nerf, I just have to say that I cant remotely understand why the developer decided to make the game harder.

I understand that there are players who have mastered all difficulties and for those players, a new, higher difficulty was implemented. Why punish those players who were fine with the game as it was? I sincerely hope lessons were learned from Helldivers.

To those who react to what I said above by telling me to ""get gud"" or leave the game:
I am still learning and I know I have much to learn still. But as said, Im just a casual dude who plays some operations in the evening with friends and not the best player out there. I wonder who those balance changes are aimed at: the elite of the best players who are bored or a larger portion of the player base.

Theres no denying it: I am severely pissed off. Just got my first fencing weapon, played some really intense operations and barely made it, only to get the thing that made it possible get nerfed the next day.

Also, from consuming content very experienced players created, I understand that once you have perfected your parry timing, you go back to balanced weapons anyways because of their better stats. So the best of the best arent even affected by that change. Its rather kicking away the crutch of those who need it. Telling them to just keep dying until they have perfected their timing. Which does not sound like fun progression. In a cooperative game anyways.",2024/10/18,en

It's cool, it's not completely cool.

The refreshing part is the picture, which is enough for the 40K world to feed IP fans.

There is no completely cool part is the kernel of the gameplay. I strongly doubt whether the developer has some special XP, which causes them to make the following game characteristics:

1. I like to watch others fight and fight pistols myself.Well, everyone sees that I have made the main battle tank and fearless model, but sorry, players can only watch them firing and watch the large troops fight.When you turn your turn, I will give you a dozen bugs to practice the marksmanship for you. As for the tide and tank cannons in the distance, it is just a background board.

2. Is it orgasm?Give me back!Although there were only a dozen bugs who practiced my hands at a time, one said that the execution mechanism was still very cool, especially when I operated in the first level of the people in the chaos.At this time, my adrenaline broke out, and the human nore was combined.

Looking for the next target blood sacrifice emperor, you can wait for me to be a long -press E key to turn on the black screen reading door., Or a elevator for ten seconds to raise the E key.The damn rhythm control, like the teacher in the film just shouted Ya Shi butterfly, the male lead really stopped the trousers away.

Really Bad: playing solo campaign on veteran and can barely get through any set pieces without dying 100 times and is not skill issue. They did not play their own game to see that combat, while looking great, is derpy af

Will talk about it on core, i hope they see this or hear it, I really like this game but the combat makes it hard to love. will edit review and switch to thumbs up once combat is fixed but I'm super tilted by the sloppy combat in this game.

1) getting pummeled at range while having no cover sucks and we’re no dodge ninjas. Range damage should be hella lowered. I'm busy dealing with the problem in CQC. if they wanna pepper me while i'm in there -- fine. If they improve the health return mechanic maybe its less of an issue, but its just not fun getting peppered relentlessly while I'm in a scrum. I realize it maybe more realistic, but is video game who cares.

2) parry need to cancel current action and take priority over all other moves (except executes aka glory kills), and it needs to be generous with direction and timing. We have hoards of dudes crawling into our butts. It may not be realistic but it feels good video game wise — doom 2016 and eternal does this super well with glory kills. Doesn’t matter if I’m reloading or scratching my nuts I press glory kill and I glory kill. Executes already does this in game, parries should do this as well

3) I find myself parrying even if there is no blue circle. Let parries just work — like Arkham games. the number of times a sword guy does an non-blue non-red attack and I parry only for the game to derp and I get hit anyway is massively aggravating. I could have been spamming attack, but when I spam attack, there's a blue circle and I'm in an attack anim and can't parry. This isn't some fighting game where misreads are punished. Let the players parry. The animations looks sick for it I want to spam the parry-gun shot follow up all freakin day man.

4) The game only lets you self heal on glory kill when you have white health. White health lasts like 0.000001 seconds. Get rid of white health, it's dumb. All executes should just self heal. This will let us tank the range damage we're getting pummelled by when we are in a melee scrum. Medkits can then and should be saved for ranged encounters (where executes aren't available).

5) Armor is weird and makes little sense. Make it one bar or just get rid of it. I don't remember needing it in SM1 and I'm not even sure what is does except go away quickly and never come back.

6) mission set pieces seem to be designed for 3 players… a) set piece mechanic b) hordes of melee c) ranged minions. In solo, I can’t use 3 different weapons at the same time. Example is the rat fight -- I can't shoot the flame thrower, the ranged drones, and the damn sword guys all at the same time. The moment I swap to plasma gun/sword the rat turbines trip me on to the ground and do 1000000 damage. like did you need play these missions solo and go ""man sure seems like some cheap ♥♥♥♥ players will love this""

7) exacerbating this problem is the number of times I see ai teammates just standing there, or take a few pot shots at a baby tyrannid while a set piece mission objective is going up in smoke made me put down the game. Again, during rat missions there are drones that need to be taken out, and rats to keep at bay. Since the AI can't be bothered to use the flamethrower, I gotta keep rats at bay. What are my AI buddies doing? Shooting rats. Either make them be more effective at helping or make the set piece stuff make sense for solo play.

I actually love a lot about this game and want to play it more but combat and poor combat encounter design leaves too much to be desired right now and the game is frustrating.",2024/9/7,en

XaMaX †,1,15.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaksPlayGamesYT/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is an action game created by the Saber Interactive studio.
In the game, we control the captain Titus member of the Ultramarines order who was also the main character in Space Marine 1.
In Space Marine, we play 200 years after the events of the first part.
The combat system is well done, during the war with monsters we will use pistols, rifles and chain swords or knives.
Weapons have little ammunition, so during the fight we change dynamically as we fight, sometimes we fight from a distance and 5 seconds later we cut our enemies with a sword.
The game has 3 modes: campaign, operations and eternal war.
In the campaign we can play solo or in co-op with two friends, the same is the case in the operations we can play them alone or in co-op.
The mode is a PVP mode in which we have 3 types of matches: takeover of the area, takeover and control and annihilation.
During the online game we have 6 different character classes to choose from which differ in weapons they fight and special skills.
Classes to choose from that, that is, everyone will find something for themselves from the fight at the sniper distance to the fight in close the mainstay.
What I also have to praise in this game is graphic design and landscapes, everything is beautifully done and gives us this feeding of the world of Warhammer.
What makes me happy is that the version 1.0 of the game is very well refined and we do not have such problems here as with many other new games.
As for me, the game is great, I will certainly play a lot and wait for the next updates because Roadmap looks great for the next 2 years.

Shine,1,90.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058288611/,"Game is fun, exceptionally so.
Thankfully the devs are walking back on trying to balance the game vastly into the ruinous power's favor. Still plagued with numerous issues from crashing, networking, matchmaking, and the like.

Some of the weakest weapons are receiving a small amount of attention, making it seem like they're not afraid of making the game too hard, but afraid of making it too fun.

Hopefully the perk systems are addressed, as a majority of the traits are either wrong to take against one of its competitors, or flat out not doing anything.

The worst part of the game is the class restricting matchmaking, tossing you into games where you possibly cannot play 2 of the classes, with no way to ensure you end up playing what you want, outside of maintaining a private lobby.",2024/10/18,en
隐性恶疾,1,12.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198267866660/,"Is it possible to be a pretty good game for fans of war hammers?
Actually it should be almost completely completely facing fans' works ==
For ordinary players, there are a lot of painful pain
Overall can still play

First of all, the world view ...
Personally do not understand the World View of the War Hammer at all,
The special terms that suddenly emerged in the game are all at a loss,
There is no corresponding explanation in the game or things such as encyclopedia ==
This aspect is really not friendly to new players
However, you can directly understand that Cheng plays a fully armed steel strong man,
To go to the turbulent alien monsters, just XD
There will also be some spectacular scenes
Players who like this style purely can also play for this only for this
(It is the steel strong man who is all armed. It feels too much to defend ...
It is recommended to be simple and difficult to make simple difficulty for it.

As for the plot, it is quite direct,
Very typical European and American movies, anyway, the protagonist is the most correct,
The requirements of the protagonist can solve the problem that the problem is not so much.
Then Uncle Hei was decent, and the teammates of the white back were uncomfortable.












In terms of gaming, you can only say that it is still possible,
Different melee weapons have different attack modules, and there are many long -range weapons to choose from, and the execution is quite handsome.
In addition, the guidance is very good, and there is no egg pain and decryption.
If the battle can accept it, it is basically playing the whole process.
(But the location of the archive is relatively strange ...
It is best to enter the branch mission campaign at the beginning when you are on the spacecraft.
The main line dialogue until half, otherwise, otherwise the main line of this chapter can only start from scratch)
The rest are some bugs, inexplicably dropped the frame, the enemy suddenly disappeared, and the program suddenly stuck to pop up.
There are also some levels, for example, the level that needs to use a flame injection is particularly uncomfortable.
There is no feeling that the fire spray on the enemy at all ...
These problems will affect the experience, and there are many situations encountered.

Then there is music and sound effects,
This personally thinks it is really not too good ...
The sound effect itself is actually okay, but sometimes the big voice is not big, and the sense of disobedience is a bit strong.
However, some music often contains some strange drum sound roar, which will be mixed with the sound effects during the battle.
Plus the time when all kinds of voices are large = =
As a result, when voice, music, and sound effects are mixed together, when they are mixed together,
It often gives people a particularly messy feeling (maybe it is because I did not open the reason for British?)
It's a rare game that I want to deduct points because of the sound experience ...
(But you don't need to care about these problems when you hit it)

In short, the overall evaluation of the individual is about 7 points
If you really like this theme type player or war hammer powder, you should be able to give more than 8 points.",2024/9/30,zh-cn

(I can understand that the weak has no chance and not time),that make it a unique universe.And these 'things' are a short and thick reminder, 'there is no hope, let alone a guarantee of peace.'

The excellent campaign is a direct continuation of the first game, with a very good plot and well tied with the co-op missions showing from another point the missions led by Titus.
Here the co-op shines bringing a variety of weapons and classes of Space Marines so that we can complete the missions, which can be thrown solo or two friends (with friends is better).
The multi-joker is the extension of the co-op for a brutal PVP with various modes.Game 10/10.

Takioto,1,29.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/takioto/,"This game gave me one of the best experiences with games in 2024!

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 gives us something that is scarce today: fun and moments of admiration.It is those games that make you goose bumps with their rich scenarios full of history.And let's start there: the setting of this game is amazing!I sometimes recommend stopping during the phases and watching everything around you.It seems that every little piece before you has a story.Each stone, wall, and tree.Look at the sky, see these buildings ... It seems that they want to tell you something they have witnessed for years.This type of detail is rare in today's games.I recently read a story about the people involved in Warhammer, and they really show enthusiasm for projects and creations.They are happy doing this.And if you don't know, Warhammer is giant, especially there in gringa.

Now, let's talk about the franchise, which is dense, full of history, characters and scenarios with a gigantic weight, which makes the work even more complete.But if you are not familiar with the universe or heard of it little, don't worry.I didn't have it either, I started to be interested recently, because the game gave me this curiosity.There are already excellent Brazilian content creators addressing the theme.Space Marine 2 is a direct continuation of the first game, where we control the protagonist Titus.But don't worry, you don't have to play the first game.If you want to play, beauty, but in my opinion, the second game is an excellent gateway to this gigantic universe.

About gameplay: At first, the controls seem confused, but over time you get used to it, and everything falls like a glove.The combat is frantic and wakes up a lot of adrenaline when you face hordes of enemies.All of this while big explosions happen, the sky is filled with enemies and aircraft in constant combat, and the scenario is crumbling.It is a true war.

The campaign is ""short"", but it has the ideal size to make that taste of ""I want more"".Better this way than being dragged, full of winding like many games out there that try to sell the idea of ​​a giant campaign.In my opinion, she is at the right point.

Regarding performance, I played on the PC with a median configuration.I have an RTX 2060 and I can say that I was always above 70 FPS, using DLSS in quality mode.I did some research before purchasing the game and only saw praise for optimization.Yes, the game is well optimized and have already promised improvements in future updates.I don't have much information about consoles performance, so I owe it.

Speaking of updates, the game already has a roadmap showing a preview of what is coming.New operations, new enemies, armor, classes, weapons, and more.

The campaign can be played in Coop with two more friends.But the most fun to play in groups are operations.The game also has a PVP mode, although I haven't played much yet.I will explore more later.

Overall, Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 is being an excellent experience, and I recommend it too much!It's great to see that there are still games like that.If you have some money left, buy and have fun!

For the emperor!

[BLOP] Misanthropy-AU,0,125.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006448215/,"Cannot recommend the game in it's current release state.

Pros first off, followed by cons.

1: the game actually runs well at high framerates, optimization isn't a big issue here.

2: Gunplay & TTK are good. Recoil can be felt, guns feel good to use. not some shoddy CoD shooter with 0.2s hipfire spray TTK. The Player's ability to aim well is rewarded here.

3: The game's audio feels meaty, heavy and (relatively) realistic & believable.

4: PvE Melee combat. can't say much about it because i prefer to shoot things, but it works well in PvE. feels like they've combined valheim with dark souls.

5: Customization. Follows pretty closely from space marine 1 but with further improvements. Some of the best of any Warhammer game i've played.

6: Environment. The maps are pretty with effort and work put into them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons.

1: PvE Co-op/Campaign ques are still bugged for me personally, though they work for most people. i am unable to start any PvE or campaign game of my own due to the bug of being left on the battle barge with no UI after a black screen. - The solution proposed by a comment in the review Does work, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still bugged.
(Edit 9/09/2024)

2: PvP Que limitations. can only bring at most two friends into PvP. on the upside you can't guild stack PvP lobbies.

3: PvP Class Balance: i'm just gonna say it. mid at best. at higher levels the JPA's practically worthless. The Bulwark's relegated to using their flag ability and is otherwise worthless. Melee's just plain bad.

4: Lack of content. the main campaign is extremely short taking only a few hours to complete. There are 8 replayable PvE operations which is where the bulk of this game's content is. Shares similarities to killing floor where the only differences are as you get stronger via weapon upgrades, class & weapon perks, you simply up the difficulty instead of doing something new. if you don't care much for that, you could play through all of the game's content within half a day.
on a personal level i preferred the wave survival of the first space marine. less walking, less talking. more shooting.

5: PvE AI Squaddies. while they do have some nice features like leaving executes for the player when the bot doesn't need the armor regeneration, they overall fall short. they're not great at fighting back against the hordes, and most of the time don't cover you when your stuck doing objectives that leave you defenceless.

6: Class selection limitations - Done for balance reasons that i can certainly understand, however there's no support for people that want to play a specific class. No ability to pre-select the class you desire to play prior to queuing, and having MM filtered to suit your selection.

7: Easy Anti-Cheat. it's awful and players have already cracked it. Players running around with infinite grenades & trainer like cheats etc.

8: Lack of Shoulder camera swap for PvP. It's all about right angle peaks.

Horrifying network code:

Mechanics:

Middle battle:
Fucking another button for the parrying, (I offer) to parry on a time -pressed attack button in close combat as in the first part, I get a pussy from the fact that the parrying cannot block the blow and the other cockroach with a chatter

Far battle:
The rifle bolt and other types of these weapons are felt on the difficulties above light, like flashlights in the imperial guard, although the flashlights are more beneficial, the only acceptable weapon is Melta (I use as a shotgun), a rifle/pistol and then they are slightly better than a rifle boltI play for whom?That's right: Astartes who does not come out due to binge with trembling hands, in the sight and from the thigh the shells fly anywhere but not in the enemy.

Timaites: I don’t remember such bangs when I saw, they can’t contrast anything above the average with the most average, they cannot resurrect anything, they can’t pick up the weapons better, they can’t block the attack, raise you or finish off the enemy - it’s not always, it is not always,You will be faster bleeding than they will save you.

Scullz,1,280.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterScullz/,"About a month after Helldivers 2 launched, Arrowhead released a patch that made their game punishingly difficult and it was suddenly no longer accessible or fun to me, so I and many others quit. Their daily active players dropped off sharply after that. Saber has now done the exact same thing that Arrowhead did.

Substantial difficulty is now harder than Ruthless was before the patch with all the Extremis spawns and other tweaks. Ruthless and Lethal difficulties are inaccessible to someone like me who doesn't have the time to no-life the game and ""git gud."" That leaves me without the ability to progress, and without that I have no incentive to continue playing.

It was fun while it lasted. It's too bad this trend of Dark Souls difficulty fetishism is ruining games. What used to be recreational fun time is now far too intense and serious business. No thanks. I already have a difficult and stressful day job. I don't want or need a difficult and stressful game. I'm too old for that and I'd bet a lot of other 40k fans are, too.

Edit: Todays patch was almost everything I could have hoped for. Saber has proven (at least for now) that they actually listen to their customers and care more about whether we have fun than making sure their game is a torturously difficult Elitists Only gatekeeper circle **** like Helldivers 2 became. The rapid response and decision to roll back poorly designed and hastily implemented changes, with a few reasonable caveats, is appropriate and has returned the game to a state of play that is accessible enough to be inviting and enjoyable and challenging enough to be replayable. With that, Space Marine 2 has earned my positive review and recommendation, but I want to leave off my revised review with some words of caution:

Part of my afformentioned stressful job involves data analysis. Space Marine 2 is a great game that was almost ruined by poor decision making based on what I can only describe as poor analysis. Dmitriy Grigorenko, the Space Marine 2 Game Director, says in the 4.1 patch notes, ""Here was our reasoning before Patch 4.0: When the game came out in September, the Ruthless difficulty win rate hovered around 60%. Weeks later, and with the changes introduced by Patch 3.0, we saw that the same win rate had jumped to over 80%, and we received a lot of feedback stating that the game had become too easy—even at its maximum difficulty (at the time)."" Okay. Win Rate by Difficulty alone is a terrible way to determine whether or not a game is unbalanced unless you are also tracking the overall played time of the specific players involved, the weapons they are using, and the degrees and extents to which they've upgraded their class and weapon perks. Of course win rates on Ruthless jumped by 20% over a few weeks! The players were learning the game, learning the enemies, learning where all the equipment spawns, and progressively unlocking more powerful weapons and abilities! A full team of maxed out players (level 25 with fully upgraded Relic weapons) with over 100 hours played consistently beating the game on the highest difficulty should not be surprising or concerning. It should be expected. On the other hand, a full team of newer players leveling and unlocking their first class and weapon set should find it challenging, but not impossible. Saber seems to have looked at and listened to only the most hardcore addicted players and started tuning the game for that small but vocal group of presumably unemployed extreme gamers who compulsively devoured what was meant to be hundreds of hours of content and then whined when the game we were all still learning and progressing through wasn't hard enough for them anymore after they memorized and mastered every aspect of a game that most of the player base were just beginning to explore. As a result, Saber made PvE progression for newer and more casual players impossible (or at least prohibitively difficult) for a week. That's a really dumb thing for a smart team of developers to do.

I don't know how much data Saber is collecting or the different ways that they may or may not be analyzing that data, but this bit of insight from the Game Director is concerning without additional context. At least they did the right thing by rolling back their and they didn't take forever to do it. Hopefully they will make good on their promise to be more measured in their approach to balancing the game going forward by listening to feedback from more than just the most hyper-aggressive terminally-online game junkies.",2024/10/19,en

The cooking power is full, and the tax is absolutely not lost.It is indeed a studio that is a zombie world war. It is also very shocking to make insect tide and big scenes.The fighting leader is rough and refreshing, and the role performance is more than a little more than the first generation; the melee returns to the shield, and the per capita fear of the choice of God (even the leader hides us .jpg).And the optimization is pretty good, because they do not use D encryption directly!How loyal is this!

Khaio,1,19.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Khaio/,"Analysis totally focused on the game campaign!

This game is a work that goes beyond being just a shooting game set in space.Upon entering the skin of one of the most feared and respected warriors of the Empire, I felt throughout the game the fervor that transcends the simple act of fighting.The game made me feel like it's in a true crusade, in the name of humanity, evoking a feeling of patriotism and an innate desire to fight and die for the struggle!

The experience was especially impactful not only for the visceral and brutal gameplay (which you all know has been very rare today, having only Helldivers 2 presented something similar lately), but for the strong bond that develops between the protagonist and the NPCs that thatThey are part of their squad, which are really as heroes as the protagonist, not just limited to secondary characters who watch the protagonist do everything.Even though it is the main focus of the narrative, the intensity with which the NPCs fought by my side is as large as mine.The shouts of war, their demonstrations of loyalty and courage in combat, and the way they sacrifice themselves without hesitation create an unshakable atmosphere that emerged a lot within the game.At many times, I was not just like the hero, but as a small part of something larger - a fraternity of warriors united by a common purpose: to protect humanity at any cost.

Space Marines are not ordinary characters, and the game portrays it impressively.Each is a force of nature, not just in terms of skills, but in the way they completely surrender to combat and mission.This aspect is particularly powerful because it made me feel that the responsibility of victory was not just about my shoulders, but it was shared with each soldier around me.Their fury before decisive battles, and the relentless and infinite will to continue fighting, even in the face of insane adversities, made me feel that I was part of a much larger cause than myself.

Leaving aside what touched me most emotion in this game, now I speak of the detailed graphics that also helped amplify these emotions.Each scenario was certainly very beautiful (he took many prints throughout the phases), from the worlds devastated by war to the dark corridors of the enemy fortresses.

The combination of these elements created an experience that I haven't had been in a long time, and I believe many here understand that they haven't felt for a long time, that it is the urge to play something all day, like every minute, and when it is over, we are ""already""he finished?"".",2024/10/15,pt

- More than, lieutenant

13 years ago, the first part made a rather strong impression on me.The first shooter in the Varhammer universe, which I really liked, where the massiveness of Astartes was felt, where there was a powerful and juicy sound of a shot from a bolter, which I have never heard anywhere else.For a long time, I did not even hope for the second part, and now, after 13 years, hope appeared again.Hear the same bolt sound, feel this massiveness, and again do a pleasant thing - burn heretics, kill mutants, and eliminate the unclean.How did it happen?

Despite the fact that the first part came out for a long time, I would like to compare a little with it including.A very similar introduction, a familiar soundtrack, the narrative itself - in the new part there are many moments that were still in the first, but now they are much more modern.

First of all, I would like to highlight the graphics and locations.Despite the imperial template, the locations do not look empty and are very detailed.Sometimes I want to stop for a while to see some kind of type or battles in the distance, or see and listen to third-party dialogs.The world looks alive, and now it really looks like a planetary scale, and not just a walk along the ruins of the world-worship.

Separately, I really want to highlight the artificial intelligence Tiranid.Almost every tyranid you see has every right to get a bolter shell, it is not just an animated background.The exception here is only flying representatives.And this every tyranid wants to kill you, and it is mutually.At the same time, they act in packs, and if you figured out one of them and switched your attention to some more enemy - most likely, the next flock is already confidently selected from the flank or from the rear.It will take this, each large room becomes a new test for survival, including a new opportunity to destroy as many xenos as possible.I think this is the fervor of the battle, entering it is quite simple, and this is a very delivery process.

With artificial intelligence, partners are a little more complicated.At least yes, they are not for beauty, and in the same way they are trying to deal with the enemy with you, they will raise you when wounded, and they will carry out finishing up in the same way (when there is no one left).Although sometimes there was a feeling that it was not clear where they were, and what they are doing, and whether they kill enemies at all.Unfortunately, they cannot be customized, a specific weapon is given to them, or to give orders, or at least set some basic tactics of actions.Therefore, I got the impression that the campaign is very sharpened under the coop - to play the game with two fighting brothers will probably be much more interesting.

The plot is quite short, passes in about 8 hours.And only I began to think that he began to become a little boring, and it seems like everything is already going on to end, as this very plot began to accelerate, aka gravibike, painted in red.Separate missions sometimes add small individual mechanics, new types of weapons are gradually issued.Basically, these are, of course, bolters who are not very different with each other, but there is an opportunity to try different and choose the most loved for yourself.Several different types of weapons of close combat, different types of grenades (which is also pleasant).I managed to touch PVP a little, now it works a little with difficulty, but it is playing quickly and pleasant.

There is some feeling of a sort of patterned of modern games - the linearity of the corridors, it is parry, to avoid this, periodically clean the barriers.But the most important thing is the quality with which this is done.And in my opinion, it is done very well.And well optimized - on my not the most modern gland is played quite smoothly on high, without flights and without bugs.In our millennium, not every release game can boast of the like.

Given the fact that there is Roadmap, and there will be more new cards, weapons and so on, and the game will develop further - in general, I believe that this is a very, very worthy continuation of the series.Perhaps there are some disadvantages, but I think they are rather insignificant or subjective.I hope that I will still stay in PVP and PVE modes for longer.For the process is very

[IF-CM] Evoke,0,85.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IF-CM-Evoke/,"A month has passed since the release of Space Marine 2, so now there is an opportunity to express your thoughts about the game, based on the experience gained, and not on a general hype.
First of all, on behalf of the oldest Order of Imperial Fists, I want to express a great gratitude for the developers for the new breath, which they gave all the Warhammer40k fans, taking up the creation of Space Marine 2 and, more importantly, bringing the matter to the release.I’ll take the courage to say that other clans - both veterans and completely newcomers - are inspired by the work done.

Many clans decided to devote a long time to the game’s expectations for preparations for the upcoming battles, events and the construction of diplomatic relations.Based on the volume of information, the clans were largely counted on the possibility of flexible and multifaceted interaction not only between game communities, but also between individual players.

Dynamic missions full of enemies of the Empireum for some time dragged on all the players.And after the fans enjoyed the PVE mode and got a lot of positive impressions, the large stream of players switched to the PVP mode.Here they were faced with a huge number of problems, among which the most striking example is the lack of a stable connection when starting matches.The clans, for their part, felt this problem in a double size - in addition to constant disconects, the problem with the stability of even a simple gathering of a group of three people was added.

Enough time has passed, but the players received only one patch that corrects small and insignificant ones - against the general background - problems.This fact currently causes open discontent among players.For clans, the situation is currently aggravated by the fact that there are absolutely no tools for inter -plane interaction and recruiting.If a team of developers in the process of creating a game was interested in the history and experience of the original Space Marine, then he probably knows - in many ways, clans supported the activity there.And they still do it.Even after 13 years, the game contains inter -clan events, interaction and activity.A flexible system for setting a private lobby in the original Space Marine allows you to gather teams up to 8 people from each side.A simple click on the player’s nickname enables the apothecaria in a short time to recruit a talented player to his team.In Space Marine 2, not one of these aspects was implemented.We understand that this game was not promised as a complete reflection of the first part, but the limitation existing in it is fundamentally killing the creation of strong relationships between players and the formation of a large stable community of fans of Space Marine 2.

The developers offer players to leave on the forum and in Discord reviews about problems in the game, but they never give specific answers or reports about the work done.But on the Internet, interviews are heard in full swing, rumors about the development of new games pop up.And even about the third part of Space Marine.

Perhaps this is an unwillingness to take responsibility for the fate and development of his project, which successfully “shot” against the background of the absence of other Warhammer40k games.Perhaps my opinion is a mistake, and somewhere in the depths of the studio is preparing for the exit mythical, magical, everything correcting patch.But these are only theories and assumptions that will be refuted or confirmed in the future.

And we players want to be heard now.",2024/10/8,ru

First talk about advantages
40K environment screen performed the best game
Various outdoor scenes are definitely not comparable to the dark indoor perception of dark tide
The background board head and Tyron are shot, plus the Zombie World War and the same insects and seaworm walls, to optimize or even be good in the case of ensuring so many units.
Hammer pink light can directly pay the ticket money with a few big scenarios
There is also a dialog on the warship. The NPC dialogue before each level is different
When I saw you coming over and kneeling in a row, I was still excited to chat after the battle
Still a game that can be worth the fare from the details and screens
————————
After talking about the advantages, start talking about the shortcomings (this time I only talk about the gaming experience, and set the enemy's intensity)
The most important problem, the performance of the character is too weak
The overall character performance is not even as good as the dark tide. The three original cans of Diaomin Qihai Swimming SM2 are surrounded by mobs to sweat back.
There are also dark tide and the same annoying mob+sniper monsters to interfere with your melee to take over the enemy
Melee attack, shooting guns, dodge, blocking all of the blocks that can be unliked. It seems to wear a canned food. The actual toughness is extremely low.Half blood, a mob+a medium -sized monster can blew you in the corner to insult and death
Your valuable two/three -frame shields only use a certain use when resisting remote shooting. The most basic soldiers will break the one -grid shield.There will be two sniper fancy cranes behind the two sniper, and the hard -straight really hard -working knife will even be cut back to interrupt a constipation.
(In the multi -person mode, because of the strong binding of fighting and execution, it will even be executed, so that the canned food that is originally paste is even more paste)
When a large number of enemy mobs are receiving the enemy mobs, you will even sweat the best way or even avoid melee to fight more remote

The power of all the weapons of bombs and weapons is very problematic (and whether the Star Warrior can't hold the gun or not)
Compared with the strike effect of shotguns in the dark tide, the explosive shotgun in your hand is simply a water shotgun.

Based on the retro abstract single -key bit design: (Left -click shooting and right -click the melee open -mirror opening wheel switch mode/magnifying multiplier C key)
There is also a problem with the liver degree of PVE outside the bureau,
The full level of the weapon requires a minimum difficulty of more than 80 games. When you understand the key nodes of the lock, you need to use key items to unlock it. The overflow experience before unlocking is directly overflowing.
Combined with this PVE key item, I do n’t know if it is a random refresh and a random position. You need to lick the map like a white book (currently you have lick only 2 key props)

The multiplayer mode cannot be repeated, but the switching occupation requires a 50 -meter walk to find the Martian guy to switch the occupation/modification installation.
It seems that the PERK choice of the three -choice one is not opened to you at the same time. For exampleAnd after unlocking, you need to spend money on the game in the game
Unlocking weapons also requires the purchase of currencies in the game, and you need to spend money to buy by unlocking painting (I bought DLC, do you want me to buy it again in the game?)
And it seems that this currency can only be upgraded to get
Summarize
If you are a hammer powder, you can pay the fare by the picture

1. You stealth nerfed the dodge distance and invulnerability window, now my space marine felt like he is overweight and hasn't exercise in years. The distance traveled felt unnatural even to the naked eye, its like my character hit an invisible wall as he jumped. The fact that the Developers kept this from us is a big red flag.

2. The new teammate distance mechanic on ruthless and lethal has never been tested before release, you can tell they never take snipers into consideration at all, how can they play their role as range support if they cannot stay back and provide cover fire. And why implement this to ruthless, if you want to provide a challenge for the elites among us, this mechanic should only be in lethal difficult if ever. This is clearly Hubris on the Developers part, and the success of Space Marine 2 have gone to their head.

3. Your current Operation enemy director is not functioning as intended, enemy spawn rate is all over the place even on low difficult. 6 to 7 Majoris drowning a single level 1 to 3 player on Minimal is crazy (I have encounter this multiple times when joining a game). How are new players able to learn if they are getting hammered from the very beginning.

Enemies are still able to shoot at my feet and damage me through the elevator floor, imagine getting sniped from underneath the floor plate by a Tyranid 5 secs after the elevator has already left the previous floor. This has been an issue from day one, 4 patches in and still not fix. I do not wish to dodge around like an idiot in the elevator, so how about you fix this immersion breaking bug asap.

The picture is beautiful and carefully seen that the character's rough face, the red helmet on the face, all day is not paralyzed, but the overall is qualified.

Effect sound gun sound is monotonous and unqualified

Shooting melee strike is not enough
I am all interstellar warriors. I shot a shot of a shot and hit the weakest bug. You do n’t give me the effect. If you are not threatened by the bug, you will pile more little mobs to shoot me. Elastic
However, the guns are executed and the dodge is done well

Single battle plot level design is qualified
There are counts, such as the bridge section of devouring insects is impressive
And changed the company's production to pay tribute to the bridge section of the previous work (I was excavated when I left everyone)

However, there are still a lot of pain points below the disadvantage of the cooperation mode containing End Game

The following starts to vomit

The hardness of the medium -sized elite enemy is unreasonable and almost hit the entire magazine bullet to kill a ordinary elite monster
However, sometimes it is time for a monster to be born. Sometimes it is possible to produce 7-8 elites at a time and then cross the entire formation and slaughter the entire team.
If you want to be slaughtered, you have to take the supermodel hot -melt gun to fight

And you let me play an elite, you have to use a magazine, you give me enough ammunition?! !?!!!

The increase in each level of the shot of the cooperation mode cannot be pursued by the monster unless you get a new gun to abuse the dishes to abuse the dishes.
The effect of the character's specialty tree is not obvious, please learn from the black tide, okay ??

There are a lot of unreasonable little knives for weapon specialties to kill 10 enemies before how to kill ??!!!!

The above bounds are all uncomfortable points at all
I doubt whether the producer has played his own game

The following is the design vomiting

The level route is exactly a single consecutive point of exploration (of course, the producer did not do anything to collect ...)
And there are only 6 pictures to be sincere ??? Do you look at the remnant2? !!? !???????????????????

I'm a ASTARTES. I Hold a Bolter in my hand and shoot away the weakest insect with one shot. Isn't it reasonable that you gu't me such an efficiency? he insect is not a threat enough, just add more more moss and shoot them for me. ...
But I did a good job in executing, Parrying, Dodging, ETC.

The Single-Player Campaign, Plot, and Level Design are all considerd passable.
Several Levels, Such as the Scene with the SWARM of Swallowing Insects, Are Impressive.
Moreover, after Changing the Production Company, there are still some parts that pay tribute to the previous SpaceMarine1 (Leaving It for Everyone when Y)

However, there are many Pain points. The follow shoulders are included in the cooperation mode of end game.

Start vomiting next

The Hardness of Medium-Sized Elite ENEMIES is Unrensonable. It takes almost an Entire Magazine of Bullets to Kill An Ordinary Elite Monster.

However, when arranging the space of monterse, sometimes 7-8 elites can app only, rushing across the entire formation and killing the entire team in anstant. Moreover, The TTK SpecialTies of Ordining Elites Cannit Be Cleared Quickly.

If you do, I have to her with me with a supermodel's melta gun.

And you asked me to use one magazine to shoot an elite, but you gave me insufficient ammunition?!?!?! The bolter has 210 rounds of ammunition?!?!?!?!

The Guns Obtaine in the Coopative Mode Cannot Keep Up With the Improvement of Monsters at Each Level. Vel, Otherwise, there will be no happy feedback from upgrading when you get a new gun and reach a new level.
The effect of the character specialization tree is not obvious. Can you please lead, 40k: darktide ??

There are many unrensonable skills in the weapon specialization tree. The knife neededs to kill 10 enemies in a row before it can be attached. How to kill ??!!!!!!!

All of the above are functionally unsatisFying points.
It makes people wonder if the product have event their own games.

The followIn is a complaint about the design

The level route is completely single and there is even the slightest bit of explicy the product, has
And there are only 6 map to play. Where is your sincericerity ??? LOOK at remnant2 next to it? !!?!? !????????????????????????

Game General Comment: 8.5/10
At present, more than 100 hours of fulfilling customs clearance, the experience is a refreshing battle, everything is cut, killing a blood path in the Terren Zerg.Local customs clearance, but there are no rewards and attributes in the battle, but simply watching the plot, the battle is very much, the melee is handsome, most of the content of the game is on the content of the PVE, but all of them are repeated levels.Level and weapon level, if you don't like to brush, the content of this game may be relatively small. About 5 to 10 hours of campaign plot, there are still problems in the game. The default button is very unfriendly., The game balance is not very good, the optional weapons and the ability to play are those who are available. Playing needs to be proficient in counterattack to have a good game experience. PVE content can be proficient in the shield guard (using the shield back).It's easy to play other occupations.

In general, the war hammer powder can consider buying and playing. If it is not a war hammer powder and does not like to brush, the original price is a bit high at the current price. You can wait for discounts.You can only buy the standard version to experience the plot. The luxury version only has skin.",2024/10/5,zh-cn

This game also stands out to Black Myth Wukong, having a very pleasant linearity, letting you focus only on gameplay and history, and have more detailed scenarios, as they don't have to worry about filling an open world that usually end up being killed.

XaMMCTeP,1,34.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003583571/,"A game about pathos ultramarins against the great liberators of the galaxy from all garbage, or just tyranids.The battles against them are shown very beautifully, somewhere in the distance there is a fight of the guards against the Horde of Tyranids, somewhere tyranids fly, and it is felt that there are really a lot of them.
Pros:
The cooperative (each character has its own remarks, also a spoiler in the last mission, each character will have its own dialogs that other players will not hear)
A lot of tyranides that can be killed
The network game is funny, many classes compared to the first part
Operations of DOP mission that reveal the main campaign on the other hand

Of the minuses:
In the network game, there is only one Order of Chaos and customization is possible only in the color scheme (perhaps this will change with the release of the game, because he played in early access)
And there are no more minuses, for me personally

I recommend fans, and those who are little familiar with Vakhu will have fun to shoot enemies",2024/9/9,ru

mhenryblack,1,35.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mhenryblack/,"For almost a decade, I wished for a sequel to Space Marine.

I was afraid it would never happen. THQ crashing and burning had left the possibility of a true sequel in limbo. In spite of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, and a fairly large cult following, I had doubt that anyone would pick up the ball, and finish what Relic started.

Then, to my shock, a couple years ago, a trailer drops.

I wanted to shout for joy, but almost instantly, I became skeptical.

Worried that my beloved game could never have the sequel it deserved in our current development culture. The new studio would gut it of what made it's soul, insert contrived modern tropes and disrespect the source and setting.

I have NEVER been so happy to be wrong.

Space Marine 2 is Marvelous. Jaw-Dropping.

Saber has taken Relics Masterpiece to new heights, added new mechanics that enhance the experience and expanded the multiplayer, seamlessly weaving it into the campaign, making it far more interesting and addictive that it's predecessor.

It's BIGGER, BLOODIER and even more BAD*SS.

Titus' story continues, wonderfully connected to the previous installment, ending it's chapter with a promise of more, and leaving me READY for the next sequel. SM2 NAILS the vibe of Warhammer 40k, outright stunning at few moments. The setting and the previous game are treated with reverence and attention to detail.

For hours, I lost myself, engaged, immersed and awestruck at the spectacle, even more so because I had come to believe it would never happen.

Bravo, Saber, Focus, GW and Everyone who made this happen.

I want to specify that I really appreciate the license.I sanded the first younger opus, I devour the novels, I like to paint and play on the table.All that to say that I had big expectations and focus and Saber knew how to raise the hype.

I pre-order the Gold version games on PC, RTX2070, I7-10 etc ...
I now have 40 hours of games.

Spoil: I don't recommend it ...

Okay!The game is good.The universe is well rendered.We take part in beautiful battles.The fights are dynamic, it's gore, there is lore, personalization etc ...

But ... far too many negative points.

Already solo the campaign is too short.Cold shower at the last mission.A few more hours would have been welcome for a project for this extremely expected scale.The scriptwriters did a clean job, resembling the books but that's it.
The gameplay on the other hand was really badly fucked up and completely breaks the immersion.
Invisible walls on our way.Pressed a touch for more than a second to collect an object or activate a button.Be forced to hit two dialogue lines before opening a door ...
Level combat is arena.We put ourselves in the middle and we collect.No strategy, no cover.An extremely wobbly shield system, regeneration, execution, parade that has no synergy.No upgrade system of our hero.Some enemies become a real purge and the mass is not used for much if not put the brothel on the screen.

Coop ... Good!It's super cool to be able to play the parallel missions of the main adventure.On the other hand, where are the other missions?6 That's all ??An upgrade system that filled my eyes with tears to me after realizing that you would have to make scripted missions that I really don't want to start again.Especially since there is no link between the PVE and PVP ...

The PVP ... I expected a lot.I even thought he would give the countryside to focus on it ... Ba no.The progression system is really badly thought out.The class seem unbalanced to me.3 maps ... seriously ??Very few weapons and armor to unlock and which have little connection with the fact of setting up a particular class.No skins for chaos?!

Frankly there is a very good base for a good game but they only produced half of what should have been expected.The graphics are ok tier, the atmosphere catches up with the blow but not optimization ... The PC PC in average graphics.
There are only promises for the rest (Darktide syndrome?) And I have a lot of trouble believing it.

First, it's nice to find the universe in a big budget game.Indeed, since the setbacks of the last Dawn of War, the big productions were chilly.
On the other hand, there have been lots of games with small budgets or indeed which are nuggets.

Graphics level, it's really very beautiful.I don't have much to say more, the visual of the universe has nothing to prove.

On the technical side, it is really very greedy in processor resources, I had trouble at the start.
i5-8600k
7900XT
16GB RAM

Before the last patch, my i5 could no longer.I still observed the effectiveness of the game cache system, bravo the devs.Indeed, the more I played, the less I had performance problems.However, I had many crashes at some point by playing multi.

Gameplay level, it is a return in the years pre 2015. It will not suit everyone, but the recipe is effective.
There is the same spirit as the first, but well improved.I think of the executions that are enjoyable, dodge, parade, shot and reflex parade.Everything comes naturally.The arsenal is quite generous.

History level, it is in line with the first, epic, even really very epic at times.Good W40K, what!

Content level, we stay in modern games that make bets to hold or bring the players back over a year.So the basic content may seem moderately abundant.

The multi I only did the coop operations and frankly, it's really nice to play.
I think the game will last me for a few months, even the year, given the content announced.

For weak points.Having played the game since early access, I would say:

- Bugs are boring, we repeat: do not play at the exit.
- A repetitive aspect in the gameplay: if you don't like, go your way.
- The output of late patches and features, I think of the ultra-wide support.
- We want more.",2024/10/20,fr

- Already, it's a corridor game and not necessarily most interesting, it's nice but it becomes very quickly repetitive.
- The game will not revolutionize anything, must be understood, it is a classic hack and slash.
- Currently, I do not know if it is only my case but still, optimization outside the game, that is to say the loads, the connection attempts, Toussa, are completely messy.
- The personalization of the characters, originally over-sale, is really not so advanced as that, there are quite a few elements of customization to unlock (and they are long enough to unlock the story to make it last).
- The bestiary is not very provided and, not to mention the rare bosses, we end up with no more than 5 different types of enemies for the two antagonistic factions.

Fixxer,0,23.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordhighfixxer/,"Problems With the Progression System
The current progression system in an otherwise great game is a turn-off and is going to drive would be players away from sticking with the game as it evolves over the course of its road map

Separate Cosmetic and Class Progression
Having a single currency, Requisitions, be required to progress these categories puts players in a position where they are going to make mistakes as they try to kit out their preferred Astartes Chapter. Players will be in search of the correct right shoulder insignia or company pauldron trim paint and this means sacrificing progression of class skills. There is no explanation of this risk to a new player and the system itself is so frustrating its easy to have level 15 in a class and not be able to afford even the first row of its perks.





The weapon system is convoluted and tying better weapons behind higher difficulty is a guaranteed way to drive players away out of frustration. The Minimal difficulty in this game is hard and recommending ""Level 5"" to players to take on the next difficulty tier is meaningless if they have spent their Requisitions on cosmetics instead of their class skills.





This game is going to draw a lot of attention when it fully launches. People will be excited about playing as a Space Marine. Even with the above suggested changes the game is going to be a GRIND to progress. When players find out their progress is also heavily skill gated in what is a seriously difficult game they will move on to the next thing. Its important to preserve the high difficulty for players who have the skill and want that challenge. its equally important that the perks and equipment necessary to play on higher difficulties become available to players of lower skill and that the systems involved here be retooled quickly or this game will end up with a very small player base of nothing but hardcore difficulty seekers. The entire backbone of what is otherwise a great game, its progression systems, are a total miss and I hope you take the above as constructive criticism to improve the game and sustain your audience while you still have the opportunity to do so.

FirePenguin,0,23.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fpenguin5349/,"At the moment the gameplay loop is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥
For melee:
- Chip damage is way to high with no tools of either preventing it, or replenishing health. (EDIT: A melee with ""fencing"" defence type has significantly reduced this problem)
- The idea of trying to keep getting armour as if it was replenishing health just isn't a sound one. The chances to replenish it are rare, but on top of that armour has such little HP and therefore what you regain is insignificant and often immediately lost.
- Parry is so odd. Not only have I found that holding the parry button delivers better results, but also a successful parry timing is done BEFORE the hit would land, unlike all other famous parry systems.
This is not an inherently bad idea, I think it's quite novel and interesting. Especially with the imagery of a parry that is prepared for being better than a parry that is ""just in time"". However this utterly ♥♥♥♥♥ the bed against small enemies in hordes. There is no predicting in a horde, there are attacks all the time and when you see an enemy wind up and you prepare to parry, that parry is highjacked by a random enemy that you weren't prepared for, turning your Perfect Parry into the ♥♥♥♥ parry. This leads to you getting STUNLOCKED which is a cardinal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sin in games like these. Absolute wank. (EDIT: This is completely removed by using a ""Fencing"" defence type weapon. Using one removes the ""just in time"" parry and makes all successful parries the same *actual* parry. Although this makes the game much much more playable and fun and removes the stunlocking, I kinda liked the preparing idea and would like to see it delegated to rare and boss heavy attacks).

Ranged:
- Guns feel like ♥♥♥♥♥ in terms of damage. A Rubric Marine cannot tank 20 Bolt rounds to the face unless the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is named.
- Ammo is rare as ♥♥♥♥ and because of the mentioned above, is absolutely useless as you burn right through it. I only don't feel this rarity when maining a melee class for obvious reasons.

Misc:
- What the everliving ♥♥♥♥ did they do to the Jump Pack in Operations? I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if I could fall out the map, just spawn me on top of a Player or NPC if that happens. There is no good reason to have neutered it so massively.
- also why is customisation just kind of poor? I guess more will come later but just in what I'm able to change, SM1 was superior. Why can't I change lens colour or thigh armour colour? And the fact there is only Mark X ♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Give me my gorgeous Mk 7 helmet and please don't make me pay £10 for it.
- The loading screens are abysmal and absurd. Sometimes it is faster to task manager the game out of existence than to sit through loading screens
- EDIT: the new fencing weapons feel kind of OP? I know it sounds like I'm complaining that one of my problems mentioned above is now fixed, but I can now just spam-parry my way out of minor-hordes. Not very engaging, stimulating or cognitive.

Fixes:
- Either reduce the damage Minor enemies deal in melee (one Tzeench minion should not take a whole bar off my shield), OR increase shield HP (shield HP is decent in Mini-boss events like Helbrutes so if HP is raised, so should Helbrute's damage by slightly), OR increase shield regen from specific enemy executions. Rubric marines should not give 1 shield with how much damage they deal, OR increase the health recovery after taking damage lifespan. It goes away far to fast to actually act upon.
- Have an more purposeful way to regain shield. I get nearly all of my Gun Strikes just unexpectedly, even though I'm always attempting to bash and stun enemies. Make bashing leading to a Gun Strike more consistent for minor enemies.
- You should not have to use the Prepare Parry mechanic for minor enemies. Not only does it play like ♥♥♥♥, they just aren't strong strong enough to put a Space Marine on the back foot.
- Buff the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Jump pack in Operations. It should go as far and be active as much as the campaign or PVP. ""Oh the slam, it would be too OP"" then nerf the slam damage dibshit.

I'm going to keep playing this game every now and then in hopes that the higher class level experience is better, but it can't be a good game if I have to slog through ♥♥♥♥ for 25 hours just to get it to play nice. Also I haven't tried PVP yet but I didn't come here to do that, I came to slaughter xenos and traitors and indulge in a rare substance called fun.",2024/9/14,en

We fight for Macragg!
Simplicity, conciseness, attention to details and dynamic gameplay - everything is short and clear, but how much pleasure from playing this.The plot was completed by the full composition in the coop for a couple of evenings under the fun cutting of tyranids and the appeal ""brother"" to each other.The plot itself is not some kind of superly deep story.Classic (as in Waha Community they love to call it) Bolter Porno with a “unexpected” turn, but replete with pathos, the spirit of a battle fraternity, epic skirmishes and beautiful locations.You feel that you got into a small story in the gloomy universe of a distant future.Different referers were pleased, including the previous part of both the bolt Ganu, and the back characters.All that we have been expecting for so long from Varhammer in Gamdev.
The operations are mostly interesting, some mechanics pleasantly surprised.In general, they were more vigorous than the plot due to customization and class features.
PVP Pure KAF.Easy to Play, Hard to Master.The mode with a dynamic point jumping on the map, classic dedication of points and a command Desmach.Fun, cheerfully, but the close battle here works a little imbalance in my opinion.

At the exit, optimization disappeared: for some reason the game began to bent in single operations, but in the coop everything was played normally.In the PVP mode, the FPS was also less than in others (add an endless throwing with shock grenades here, the effects of the hammer at the attack aircraft and the ultimate tactical, which together sometimes made this mode non -granular).In the scenes with an abundance of effects, obvious drawdowns appeared, here my pieces of iron did not stretch.
With the last patch, the optimizon improved and the multiplayer played without any problems.In no case do not put the game on the HDD.Well, either put it and then with each load screen you will have time to brew and drink tea, do cleaning and go to the store.

The story is striking, I didn't have graphic shortage and the graphics are really satisfactory.Most importantly, it is very nice to feel like a tank with the Horde mechanics.For me, the Space Marine was the only binding feature of the game, which was really a 3 -meter -tall space infantry.Your step will shake the place, kneel in front of the gariban human beings and say my lord to you and the angels of the emperor will know.Here is the pleasure of this game here.In this game, which completes its presentation with a cinematic action, it is up to us to remove the pleasure.In general, the music is beautiful, if you already like Grotesque music, the music that this game has shit in the background will bring you to the gas.As a result, optimization and cinematic performance are really nice.

The biggest aspect of the game is unfortunately the end of the story and the online pve modes are composed of sections in story mode.Random Generate Pve If we can cut horde as a huge warrior in tasks, this game will play for another 10 years.
If they color the online part a little more and the stories independent of the story come from the taste of this game inedible and will play for years more.

In summary, the kidney is given for the story mode.But if you are not very familiar with PVP mode like me, the online part does not satisfy.The giant team announced a 2 -year plan and has plans about PVA.

Although the character Customization part is not too detailed, it is satisfactory too much to make you feel the same thing.Why would I not make a assault from salamanders and put a golden yellow band on his arm?

Feel free to take if you like the universe or high -quality third -person shooters.
I would put 10/10 but I don’t want to hurt maximalism and there’s nothing ideal so I will put 9/10.

The game has an excellent gameplay, a mixer of a third -person shooter with a simple slasher allows you to dominate the battlefield that is filled with opponents on which it is easy to apply the entire arsenal that the game gives you.(The game can be jokingly called ""50 shades of bolts"") The difficulty is quite well-fed, but starting from the veteran, I really advise playing in the coop, even though in the solo I in this complexity and ran in places due to the stupidity of the artificial intelligence of the partners, there are segments where you have to sweat.

Content in the game is a ton, there is a pathos plot company with the ability to pass it in a coop, a separate coopeous company Events whose events take place parallel to the main and the plot of both is weaved.Well, the bond-brow-brown multiplayer, but it will most likely be twisted with new seasons, the same chaosmarins do not particularly pump.

The atmosphere is thick, each frame asks for a screenshot (already 50 screenshots are ready and another billion on the way).The sound is juicy, the bolters bang as it should.In general, art and sound designs are made at the highest level.

Despite some problems at the start of early access, the product itself is extremely well optimized related to non -core and game servers, even on my old woman 2060, the average fps game with Full HD (1080p) resolution.Of course, there are a couple of places where there were serious malfunctions, but these are scenes where literally thousands of teranid are fighting with a guards in real life.

Sokomol,1,10.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020348663/,"Space Marine 2, a highly anticipated game of many players.So what to say.I got to this game because of the late delivery of Ultrawide Support some time later, but all the hype I heard around, how excellent and super game, held me all the time, so I waited forsavor.

Is it as excellent and the best as everyone says?He's not!Is it a bad game?Nor do you definitely.It is a good game for one finish that is knocked down by bad gameplay by decisions of developers.If we do not take Lore into account, because I do not follow Lore 40k much, I ended up at fantasy, so I noticed a few strange things.But aside.

Let's start with the positives: the game looks good, it is perfectly optimized, for some type ""the greater the better"" the game can cause a wow effect.The soundtrack, although it is not the best, will find a few good songs that you want to listen to several times in the evening, sound and dubbing.

And what about the negatives that I think will collide?The wrong decision type ""hold the button E half a second so you can complete the ammunition.""Level design, although the world is nice, so often repeats.Go to point A, press the button, go to point B, punch the point ... and these are probably the only 2 things you will do in this game.

Further control ... I played the game on the hardest difficulty and most of the deaths were caused precisely because Titus did something I didn't want from him.Do you attack meele by attacking enemies?What if Titus gave up and began to attack the void, where no one stands?In the game you control your attacks close to the movement keys, not by attacking where you are looking.

And another thing.The game is not very well solved input.Do you make a miserable and then do you want to make Parry?Well, you are unlucky, you have to wait for Titus to complete the animation before pressing the button, because the game does not register this.And there are plenty of such moments.Do you jump and want to throw a grenade?You're unlucky again.
The game does not contain the graceful Combat, as Doom does, where you literally do a combat ballet and everything is in beautiful harmony.


Titus, Space Marine, the best of the best.A genetically modified individual ... Here the developers said that it would not be bad if the shooting from the side was totally inaccurate and even at 20cm you can miss your enemy's hub of the size of the building.In the game you can even head to have more accuracy, but at the moment you are slowed down in a mode where the enemy can totally cut you in 1 second, you really do not want.The fact that enemies are 100% accurate with their shooting.

Bosses are not bad, but I noticed another problem with them.There is a Dodge mechanics in the game, where when you timed it correctly, you can earn more injuries when you shoot it with a script to a weaker place.This sounds good on paper, but it is not polished in the design, because you are not immune to the other phenomena, so the enemy can cut you in about 1 second animation.

Ai enemies are OK, AI companions ... They try, but sometimes they make strange decisions, like if they are to pick you up your three times, look at you, start shooting and then start to revive.

The story is here, but none of you would sit on your ass.

The game is good as this is good and I can definitely recommend it to all who like to turn off the brain and massage a lot of enemies.Unfortunately, these few imperfections do not make it as excellent as everyone says.Repair these shortcomings, accelerate Combat and it will be a great game.I am curious about further extensions.If I ever find friends, I will definitely try the COOP regime.

Space Marine 2 isn't just good, it is phenomenal. It is one of the best action games ever made. I cannot recommend it enough. If you missed old-school games where you just played the game, it's for you. There are no absurd skill trees, open worlds, or other BS, just pure game. I missed that.

Titas, who was returned to the front of the day after the primary surgery (even a strong marine died due to severe pain), is a tiranid (space monster) and the Thousand Sun (Corps of the Betrayal) with his friends.is.
The colleagues who act together are quite excellent and strong, so if you are normal, you will be able to go smoothly if you do not do it.
However, if you rush into the same feeling as the Musou series, it will die relatively easily, so use Parry, avoidance, shooting and proximity properly.
The story is hot full of bromans by strong brother.

Akio Otsuka plays the protagonist and is an action that is relatively easy for everyone to challenge, so I hope that Warhammer will spread in Japan as well.

(postscript)
We are proceeding with multi.
You can play relatively easily up to the difficulty level, but if you go beyond that, you will feel nervous at once.
At present, heavy and tactical are outstanding and strong, so it would be nice to adjust the balance.
In addition, although the reward does not change depending on the stage at the same difficulty, it is clear that the stage in the latter half is clearly difficult, so it would be nice to adjust the area.

Leon,1,89.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081017963/,"So far i am enjoying the game, a friend gifted me more than enough to get the gold edition. The first day was before the patch note a day ago, my cpu was cooking at 90c+ but now it is hovering between 65-75c max.

Honestly got no idea about the space marine story or lore, but i did play some warhammer games such as vermintide 1, and 2, darktide, and this one currently.

Graphics wise the game looks great, some details are more focused on than others, but it is really nice looking.
Not sure why they went with 3 players co-op and not the usual 4 player majority of people got used to, but maybe they have their reasons.

Game running buttery smooth, 4k max settings, native resolution, no upscaling, 65+ fps all the time. PC specs 14900k, 4090, 64gb ram.

one thing they may need to improve on, but this might be due to my region, is that i dont have any nearby servers to join to, and this affects people like me in Middle East, as the least ping we saw was 87 or 94 ping, never lower.



i recommend buying the base for now and upgrade later if you feel like it. 8/10.

RAVVSlathotep,0,83.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RAVVSlathotep/,"For all the improvements made to the core gameplay loop, a glaring issue can be found in the half-arsed implementation of the Operations mode. Unlike it was claimed by the devs, it does not have a solo play mode. It also doesn't have a proper way to ensure we are the hosts, forcing us to matchmake into an unstable pool of players with extremely long load times (we cannot kick them while they are loading), players who are either AFK or are playing dress up, or simply hanging lobbies that don't even load at all. This lack of control has, personally, forced me to leave several lobbies nearly every time I want to play a mission.

I cannot recommend the game while one of the features that offers it replayability is held back by such a poorly thought out matchmaking system. Allow for private lobbies and give us a server list, this has been solved for decades.",2024/9/6,en

DaBounz,1,188.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016181539/,"Overpriced console game.

Combat is very cinematic and looks good, but gameplay is actually rather clunky and below average in quality (badly designed and implemented arkham knight mechanics).

Difficulties for the campaign are done the worse way possible : weaken the player character and increase enemy dmg an hp while keeping encounters exactly the same aside from that. This completely ruins the flow, which is already not too great to begin with. Players should always select normal difficulty if solo, especially since AI is an insult to intelligence and increase the frustration of the bad flow even further. Higher difficulties might be fun with a group of competent players (may be).

Campaign is 6-8h long, same for PVE...won't even mention PVP which has clearly been added to the game for reddit whiners who can't handle not having PVP in an RPG (play one game to see how hilariously bad it is though). So you get what...15-20h tops out of the game tops (unless you want to farm the same 6 PVE missions over and over again for skins...but why do that anyways?). For a base price of 60 bucks + 40 bucks season pass that you won't even want to farm, this is the definition of a VERY BAD investment. Check Steam store to see what you can get for a 100 bucks and cry.

Story is cool and fits well in the current 40k storyline developments though.

Money for the emperor !

Update : even though it lacks content, PVE missions (AKA Operations) are quite tasty. The different classes, with their respective gameplays and the progression systems are nice. There have been a bunch of gameplay balancing passes that have been done since release, some are good, some are bad.

What can I say - despite the fact that the game literally with tears in your eyes and blood on bayonets makes you look at tons of kinz, that artists animators did it day and night, not seeing their guys, as well as beautiful fattas, I find that I am ironic that at the timeThe first SMA, many scolded the game for Kinzo, and Dark Souls was felt with something fresh.Now the arrow turned.

Campaign:
A dark -skinned bro and an Indian from the ultramarins tribe join your funny campaign towards adventures in the gloomy 41th millennium.Do not get to the bottom - that chemistry between the characters, that the memes from the first part, that the tone of history, that the kilotons of the pathos, that the bosses - everything looks quite good.Of the minuses: at some point you can tire an incredible amount of the same type of fatalics, but still, the campaign is not so long to get bored completely.
Also, the problem with non -code, brothers and sisters, in this regard, get ready even for bugs in the campaign.

Pve:
Luxurious, adventures for 20 minutes, went and went out, and all this is connected with the main campaign, very diverse in terms of missions and opponents, and generally a healthy thing.BUT!Destroying problems, I remind.

PVP:

I'm convinced the game is single handedly being held up by the fact that it's a 40k game alone. If it were any other franchise it would have tanked day one. The game was already in a state that desperately needed changes and buffs, but instead they just nerfed the players to ♥♥♥♥. The coherency feature is just godawful and makes absolutely no sense in this game. Your forced to either stay with your ranged team mates on melee classes, or stay with your melee team mates on ranged classes. Forget about splitting up to more efficiently complete objectives or to flank enemies. Most classes have perk options that are obsolete and never worth taking. The game was advertised as a hack and slash type horde game, but the game punishes you for using a hack and slash style. The enemies are all reactive to you, so any time you start swinging your melee weapon or shooting, they are interrupting you with attacks, which you then need to dodge or parry, and while you're being swarmed in melee, there are 10 ranged gaunts and 5 majoris with devourers peppering down your armour, which you won't get back if you aren't within 5 feet from one of your team mates now, and then every 100 meters you travel you have to deal with an extremis encounter of some sort on top of all of that. The whole game is like a souls game fight, except with additional enemies. You make one mistake, you're downed. I thought this was Space Marines, not Space Guardsmen. Only 17% of the player base has actually completed an operations mission on ruthless, but somehow the devs think the game was ""too easy""?

If you enjoy working with friends to complete objectives and feel like a bad ass doing it, then this game is for you.

Now for some improvements they could implement down the line that would make the game an even better experience. There needs to be an option to run operations solo which I believe is coming in the form of private PVE lobbies. More importantly there needs to be a way to command your AI partners even if it's only to be able to have them target a specific target cause there is nothing more frustrating than trying to deal with a Zoanthrope flying in the air with your bolt pistol cause you took a melee class. Or if you are against that then give the melee classes the ability to perhaps grab the zoanthrope from the air and bring it to the ground to then smash with their melee weapons.

Depression Fortress 2,1,134,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TAKEOFFFLY-ONE/,"This is literally the best that happened to Warhammer 40.000

Preface
The first part of the year of its release (2011) seemed morally obsolete to me: endless gray-yellow corridors, jamming of blannchiks, a trivial plot and chirping men in the main roles.The game was not terrible, it was passing.
In 2020, either from nostalgia, or having plenty of a battles-crafts with open worlds, I wanted to play something most linear and simple and I again installed Space Marine.What was my surprise when all these straightforward corridors and old -fashioned QTE did not cause me a desire to cite from a layer of dust, but on the contrary gave me the same buzz from the idea completely simple and understandable to everyone: run, shoot, overcome!

The moment of weakness is followed by life full of heresies
Clearly realizing the current gaming trend on the half -open Lutogrindyka, which is interesting to watch, but which it was completely not interesting to play, I began to waIn with the release of Space Marine 2. Inside me, it was already accepted that the game could turn out to be another newfangled shit, which are fed from the shovels of playersAnd even at some point, I almost completely lost interest in Space Marine 2, but those pleasant memories of the first part eventually sold me part of the second.And what was my surprise when I discovered that this is still the same polished classic:

- corridor levels in which brutally cheerfully arrange ultranasilia, turning into a minced meat absolutely any creature in its path and not fearing that at some point you will have to call the Ministry of Emergencies to get out of the location
- Simple game mechanics: you shoot at the block = damage;There is damage to the body =;To the head = a lot of damage.And there are no smelly tsifes with the chances of a ricochet, classes of armor and other dull ultrazadr mud for premature impotent
- No pumping in the campaign and clear as a summer day of pumping in a cooperative: more level = immobil more perki
- There is a huge scale to indecent: the game really feels as if you are the little model on the battlefield from the first Dawn of War, which was sent to a suicidal mission in order to unwind the enemy opornik and all whom you will see for delivery
- the breathtakingly beautiful equipment of the space marines, the view of which each time brings you real aesthetic pleasure (in the first part it caused, if not laughter, then at least a smile of its absurdity)
- Cool details of the world, and sometimes even whole scenes working on the atmosphere.What is the only dreadnought from the final chapter, in the pieces of iron of which there is more charisma than in some modern games taken completely

And this whole holiday of life is sprinkled with pleasant graphony with good sound accompaniment.Of course, I would like the space marines once, as they think, spoke in a low volumetric voice with a stylized bang of the transmitters in the style of Flashgitz rollers, but since Peter Gennz, apparently, is the only person with a working microphone in post-sanctioning Russia, similar to usDo not hear another 100 years. No, well, seriously, there are no other actors of the voice acting?I have nothing against the Glaints, but you couldn’t think of anything better there than to take the very last role of a person’s voice, who did not voice the station in the subway?If there is no choice, give Petra finally money or give him a stick, but make him at least at the sound recording studio be captain of the space marines, and not Peter Granets.There are no questions to the voice acting, the rest are nothing more than statists.Well, the suddenly bursting voice of Shrek on Voks in a cooperative added zest.

I can’t call it minuses, because part of the described below is noted in the road map and will be in the future, but I consider it important to pay attention to this:

-very few cards for PVP and all of them completely copy each other without any changes in all modes
- Little unique extraordinary on the weapon, and some skins are literally different only to each other only the height of the location of the cleanliness
- At the moment, they did not bring armor to the chaosites (the cargo barge of the filth is stuck in the warp storms)
- So far only 6 PVE missions
- The search for the PVE lobby could be made more convenient, sometimes it bothers three times over the fact that your Main class is busy

As an Astert, players have low speed, low blood volume, low melee damage (need to be continuously stigmatized and straight enemies will be beaten), low gear returns (need to upgrade weapons), protectThe shield is low, and the shield has a long reply time (the time is re -calculated by the remote enemy, basically rely on the execution of the enemy to reply to the shield) remote weapon bullets, the full series of shotguns scrape one shuttle, a small elite, a sniper rifle, a sniper rifleThe damage was also low before the full level. Only the hot melting gun was a little intensity (only 3 occupations had this type of weapon).

The first content of 7 campaigns+6 action modes+PVP mode

The battle mode and action mode are divided into four difficulties. Novice suggests to play the lowest difficulty or ordinary difficulty.

7 battles (invited friends to play together) are full, well-made, 5-8h.

The PVP mode is only EAC's anti -cheating. It has been occupied by plug -ins. It is not recommended to play before rectifying the environment.

After the player finished playing 6 levels of the action mode, after freshness, the focus came.

If you want to experience high difficulty, you need a large amount of duration to improve the character level and weapon level, otherwise there is no gaming experience.
The experience value of the character upgrade is linked to the difficulty, low difficulty experience, and low -level characters cannot be played at all when high -level characters are not as high as high -level characters.
Weapon experience can get the highest -level weapon at least 20 times to get the highest -level weapon (each weapon needs to be brushed like this), and each weapon also needs a lot of materials to upgrade (one level can only pick up to get one material, and the BOSS can get additional to get additional obtainedone).
After clearing all 6 cooperation model levels, after reading the plot, in order to quickly improve the player's level and weapons, they basically captured the same level to repeat the running drawing brush, full of boring.(If anyone thinks repeating the same level, it is interesting, so I can only indicate that you are right)

The standard version can experience all the game content. The luxury version only has the color and pattern of the skin (the standard version can also unlock the color changes and patterns, but there are no luxury version).You can get it, but the amount of gain is very small). The ultimate additional skin has only one occupation.The armor model (note that the model is not the color) can be unlocked by just playing a certain number of times, no need to buy DLC.

As an ultimate version of grievances, my suggestion is: If you have the idea of ​​buying, it is recommended to buy the standard version and experience the plot of the battle and cooperation model (about 12-15H). Ordinary players do not need to rigid liver character level.",2024/9/14,zh-cn

Be sure to praise which time after several updates, the EAC of this game will no longer cause memory Standby List to quickly increase and fill a large amount of free memory, so that it may fill the free memory.Leaving the game program is almost right, unlike the previous time because EAC will be stuck for a while.The EAC of the new game sword god domain dream border will not be the case, it may be new.

Because the old -fashioned EAC will not take long after each game is executed, the complete game files will cause Standby List to increase rapidly. People with less memory or more free memory will be filled, compared with Popular machine war mercenaries VI and Eliden Faf Ring are still the same.

When the Standby List memory block is filled with idle memory, the system can cause wonderful problems.
The game is probably the increase in stuttering and INPUT Delay, and adjusting the game setting will not improve, making people think that the optimization is not good, because it is affected when using memory.Some people may not feel that after all, it may be occasionally jumping in the allowable range, but mainly because the fluency will be affected.
Others have some inexplicable phenomena such as spraying, spraying errors during compilation, insufficient image processing and jump memory, but not using complete memory in the use, and they really need to use memory. Virtual memory reduces efficiency.
Until now, Windows 11 is still the same. It may not be a problem. After all, the memory is not in vain, but I do n’t know why there is something to use after filling.
Anyway, do n’t go to clear memory. You must not shut down for a long time before you can fill it up slowly. You may only be cleaned up.

Michael Obama,0,10,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991097170/,"I'm very conflicted about this game. I will continue to play and might change to a positive. But right now these are my thoughts. I have played through the single player on veteran. (which is basically hard difficulty).

Hopefully this helps people if they are struggling to enjoy the game. I know I was in the very first hours. Even now I cannot recommend at the current price even if I am enjoying it more.

In short, Space Marine 2 is effectively Darksiders crossed with Doom: Eternal, without the parts that made either of those games good.

The combat is... not particularly fun? It's very difficult to figure out how the game actually wants you to play it.

For example...

You will take damage. I think this is intended, but initally feels at odds with the fact you are a hulking tank of a space marine. That's werid, but okay I just don't understand the game perhaps.

Anyway, you can't avoid taking damage, so in order to not die, you have to perform executions/context specific moves to get back armour (which is basically health). This is very much like doom eternal where you get enemies into a stun like state and do an execution to get back ammo/health (even has the same flashing red thing around enemies)

But the problem, this play style is full of inconsistency. In Doom Eternal you can attack enemies while reliably know you can get ammo/health/whatever. In Space Marine 2, this is not possible. The gun shot thing might happen or it might not. Parries sometimes work, and feel like sometimes they don't. It can be hard to tell when an enemy will go into an execution state while you are attacking it and so predicting when you are about to get the next armour boon is hard.

This makes a lot of the combat is more random and about chance than anything, and the game is about managing your health in this regard.

So you think, okay, maybe I'm doing it wrong. I'll sit back and used ranged weapons instead of melee.

No.

Guns are piss weak.

As far as I can tell, they are designed to close the distance with enemies and open them up for melee. Some special/heavy weapon are designed to shred mobs, but even then some of those enemies can block all ranged damage lol.

Okay, I'll go back to closing the distance with guns, using melee combos and parrys to get armour and fight through the enemies that way. Maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥ at parrying?

Nah, because some of the early level design has ranged enemies that you can't get to... Those ranged sniper enemies can take upwards of 100 bullets to kill with some weapons. That is almost all of your ammo for one enemy?! How the ♥♥♥♥ does this game want you to play? I still have no idea after 9 hours.

Enemies also need to be taken out in order because other wise you will get utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Once you know this the game is exponentially more enjoyable. But when you don't...

For instance, the ranged dudes, you might think its fine to just keep dodging and killing the little mobs first. No, no, no. If you don't go for the ranged dudes with an almost suicidal vigor you will be absolutely creamed.

You will be dodging. A lot. Pretty much spamming the space bar.

Which brings me onto the controls for PC. They are utterly utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Change these as fast as you can.

I recommend making right click aim (you know like in every game known to man) instead of right click being melee.

Then make middle mouse button parry instead of C. C being parry is utterly deranged.

Then make F melee. Trust me, again, this makes the game exponentially better.

Anyway, it' s very weird game that I am forcing myself to try and like. I do not understand the reviews that say the combat is brilliant. I feel like I'm playing a different game.",2024/9/8,en

It’s important to note that this game is not Darktide and it is most definitely not Helldivers. For some reason that’s rhetoric that kept being parroted before release.

The combat itself feels incredible and is insanely fun. I thought it felt clunky at first , but once I understood the mechanics- it clicked. This really does feel like a true return to what gaming was in the 2006-2013 era and what I wish we saw more of today.

A tight , fun campaign and not too long with the ability to play through it in co-op. Co-op exclusive missions. Straight forward PvP with a progression system that unlocks cosmetics by playing the game and weapon skills unlocked by X number of victories.

Chaos definitely got shafted in the customization since all they can do is change colors while Loyalists can mix and match different armor sets. I hope to see them expand on that as the game grows.

Tarkus,0,301.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006052891/,"30th of October review update
The game is headed in a direction I don't like. Ruthless difficulty is just not enjoyable anymore. Your space marine gets a lot less armor than in lower difficulties, while enemies just become bullet sponges. Your health pool is gated at the bottom of it, so when you have a lot of it it goes down fast, once you have fewer health bars remaining it goes down slower. It's like most of your health is concentrated in the bottom part of it. Makes no sense.

Enemies do a lot more damage in the higher difficulties, so much so that it feels unfairly punishing.

Playing against chaos is still a bad experience overall compared to Tyranids. And I don't even feel like touching Lethal difficulty with the game in its current state.

Player numbers are also dwindling down, going as low as 22 thousands concurrently playing tonight. I think the game is already on the way to die, with less than 2 months since its release.

They should have used difficulty 3 enemies health and damage values across all difficulties, and just change the number and type of enemies based on difficulties, like Helldivers 2 does. They have the swarm engine which can show you hundreds of enemies on screen and they barely use its capabilities





All I'm going to say about this most recent update is that whoever developed and approved the cohesion cringe mechanic for the new Lethal difficulty needs to be fired.

Plus, this update as a whole makes me want to uninstall the game, after playing for almost 300 hours total and every single day since its release. Feels like Helldivers 2 all over again!

I'm getting PTSD just writing this




With the latest patch, the game is definitely heading in the right direction and feels much better to play. It’s a lot of fun, and I can now confidently recommend it. As long as future updates keep improving things and don't cause any setbacks, this is shaping up to be something really great, and it already is.

It's almost unbelievable in 2024 to see a development team that’s so competent, knows what they're doing, and can deliver a solid update for their game right from the get-go

The only downside after the latest update is the persistent stuttering, which wasn’t an issue before

The stuttering has been fixed with a hotfix




I've experienced my PC hard freezing twice - once after the prologue mission and another time while attempting to close the game, which forced me to restart my computer. However, since the latest hotfix, I haven't encountered any further issues like this.

For reference, I'm running an AMD Radeon RX 6800 and an i9-10900KF.


Matchmaking in operations is bugged; often, it simply doesn’t work. On top of that, difficulty level 4 operations are frustratingly hard, reminiscent of the problems that have plagued

Here are some specific issues I’ve noticed. These are strictly regarding PvE Operations mode, especially at the highest difficulty 4:


1. it's one of the main reasons the game feels so frustratingly difficult.

2a. : Timing a parry feels unreliable, although it gets better once you get more used to it.
2b: The shield block doesn’t block all blue attacks, which doesn’t make sense to me.

3. You're always scraping for ammo, which feels excessive.

4. Enemies feel like bullet sponges. It takes a lot of melee strikes and ranged shots to bring down medium and heavy enemies (not including bosses, which are mostly fine). Even small units, especially the Chaos ones with shields, are way too tanky.

5. Just 2-3 hits from medium or heavy enemies will bring you down. With the weaker classes you can die instantly even when at full health.
Your armor feels like paper, and you’re constantly running out of it.

6. Chaos is much more frustrating to fight than Tyranids, though Tyranids aren’t much better.

7. Some classes are much more effective than others, with the Assault class being one of the weakest.

8a. Difficulty 4 is necessary to unlock the highest tier weapons, so you're forced to play at that difficulty sooner or later.
8b. A lot of these issues would be solved if weapon progression wasn’t locked behind higher difficulties. Let the hardcore players push through difficulty 4 and above while allowing more casual players to enjoy the game on difficulty 2/3, even if unlocking weapon tiers takes longer.


As a result, a lot of players end up avoiding combat altogether and rushing straight for the final boss/encounter. But if you're avoiding combat in a game like what's the point?

The game desperately needs better balancing, and an FOV slider on top of that. One of Saber developers mentioned that it’s fine for players to feel overpowered in PvE, but not in PvP. Well, as it stands, we actually feel in operations. Even the campaign, on difficulty level 4 is easier, much more fun, and overall more enjoyable.

4-5 hours to play gameplay questions:
Players can perform multiplayer mode after the early chapter, players can choose multiPaign and Operations.But after a comprehensive play, the difficulty design of the game is completely unreasonable.The lowest difficulty played.The feeling of the character's long -range and melee switching design gives me a very uncomfortable fighting battle.

Because I prefer the sniper occupation. Although the sniper is clearing high -quality enemies, the elite enemy and the BOSS battle output are extremely high, but the core of the combat design is to encourage players to alternate melee remotely.The big AOE skill and miscellaneous efficiency.The loading capacity of firearms and weapons is also too low. In the case of low difficulty in early wasteland, high -quality monster sea firepower and ammunition are not enough to clean up.In the miscellaneous soldiers.
(If you want to sniper the ammunition cycle plus the ability to be able to make the character almost full, because the answers are all in the laser sniper of the sniper's talent to kill the ammunition.. So I have to sit at least 20 hours to prison to refreshPlay, right)

UPDATE:
The CPU temp problems have been fixed finally and I don't have to worry about it overheating on me.

This game is my first ever Warhammer game apart from the actual board game itself and I've got to say. I absolutely love everything about it. Just killing so many creatures at the same time with a whole sword and stuff feels extremely satisfying and the gore makes it 100x better too.

The story itself is pretty short but the missions are quite long so you've got around over 8 hours of gameplay with the campaign alone.

The side operations are really fun to do as well as they are linear to the story line of the game.

Aside all that. 9/10 fantastic game, definitely recommend",2024/9/6,en

BUT!

I put a negative review, because they got problems with the connection!There is no more strength to endure it.Breaks of connection with the server occur very often.Especially infuriates when you are thrown into the room almost at the end of the mission (session).As a result, lost progress and time.

Seibers, as if they had not taken out important lessons from the World War Z, there were the same problems at the start, and now it happens.
In short, their network code goes along.
It is already very high time to do something with this code.",2024/10/23,ru
EMPulse,0,29.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988842298/,"The campaign is okay.It's a rather radical development, but it's rarely ridiculous.
However, the main campaign, which is divided into two main campaigns and PVE campaigns, is a bit short.The average PVE campaign is the average.

The graphics are excellent, the directing is fine, and the chest is magnificent, but people who don't know the Warhammer 40000 setting can just ... Oh, there are many monsters.

In other words, as all other Warhammer 40K games do, it doesn't tell you the world's setting.
In particular, the warp -related settings are a bit unusual ... There is a long -distance scene in the middle, but in the middle, there is no explanation of the situation where communication security is broken and why it is broken.It may be, but it can be understood at all.

If you don't know Warhammer in the first place, if you listen to the word Warp, you should just think about it.

In the end, there is a part that is satisfied only by the 40K fans of the Warhammer, and the new inflow is difficult to expect.
However, it is true that there are some parts that make use of the Wohammer 40K fans that are satisfied with the sights and settings that are satisfactory.


But the game is honestly dislike
First of all, the motions are heavy and dull to save the heavyness of Space Marine.This may be a bit frustrating.
In particular, campaigns often have to fight dogs, but sometimes the motion is slow and heavy and the next command input is delayed.
People who like to be able to manage them and cancel motion can be used to manage this, but those who are more likely to be fps can be annoyed.

And customization is not free to pretend to be fucking free.
First of all, it is difficult to match the skin with the codex standard, or there is no decal for some bottles and characteristics.
There may be some people who want to get a testimony among the 40K fans.
At the same time, Ultramarin is the main character chapter, so it's okay to use Ultramarin, but there are many chapters that use the classification and characteristics that do not follow the codex.

And changing the armor skin and armor color is quite inconvenient.I keep going back and forth, and I have to repeat it.
And PVE, PVP and Skin Settings are the same, but the two should be shared and the two must be separately ....
Another reason why there is no function to delete the armor or color settings?
In addition, when the main campaign comes, there is a bug where all the armor colors set in the multi -to -do Ultramarin are returned to Ultramarin.Save in different colors is also changed to ultramarine color.

I feel that I made PvP quite a bit ...
There is no function to see my total.Didn't you find it?But ... there is no place to go around the battle pants.Why is this not?

Besides, when you enter the game, you will see a video of the map at first ... I can't skip it.Even if I was in the middle!
That's why Gem is already running inside, but I have to be watching the map.
Of course, this is a 50: 150 picture of this.Of course, our team is 50

And Chaos is not just as free as the imperial smash.Skin is fixed and fixed, and it is possible to change color or some decals.This is a bit disappointing.
So if you don't care about it, you can also like the Southern Line Color Corn Buzzer.

Finally
As a Warhammer 40K fan, the campaign attraction is excellent, but
As a multiplayer game, the game is somewhat poor ...

As a Warhammer 40K fan, the campaign score is 9 points
I think the game score of multiplayer games is 6.5 points.

Therefore, if you can't die at 40K Warhammer, it is recommended as a standard purchase, but if not, it is honestly C -class

Instead of playing for a super-mega tank, I seem to play for a suffocation that flies into a lobby with 1 missed poke.I do not feel any speed or reaction of Spacmarin, his strength and vitality.Rather, I feel that some kind of omeganchik was stuck with a papier-masha with a armor, while everyone around was driven in titanium alloys.

At the end of the game, I am already morally tired that the dodgers are poorly made that the mobs are not sharpened for this.The same chaos dreadnought has an attack from which it is impossible to escape, but it can be avoided with a dump, but he immediately makes another attack, so that, as they would call the Souls in Dark, to catch in the roll.

Well, pre-ordered this game as fast as possible since I saw the gameplay... it was like love at first sight, never played read anything about the universe of Warhammer 40K and I knew this was the entry point for it, didn't disappoint at all.

Positives:

-Main story is very good, for a person that didn't played the first game I get to knew Titus and understand what he did back there and that it is still haunting him.
-I didn't knew the universe of warhammer 40k but got a pretty good taste of it because of this game and I want to know MORE!
-Character development, even tho the campaign is short the characters have a good development (will not talk about it because of spoiler), specially the other 2 brothers that fight along side you.
-You can play co-op in the main story and the other mode which is super interesting, you can play your story with your brother and enjoy the masterpiece that it is.
-The Swarm technique is insane, seeing all the hundreds of monsters around and around the map without taking a huge toll in your pc performance its incredible, it feels marvelous fighting hordes of horrendous heretics without burning your pc!
-SO MUCH TESTOSTERONE ! FOR THE EMPEROR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Negatives:

-Bots-AI they get stuck sometimes
-Some visual bugs in pieces of the armor while watching a semi-cutscene, kind of distracts you
-Super short main story, around 8/9 hours which is a bummer since it was going pretty well.
-Can't customize anything in the campaign basically, it is poor the characterization of Titus and his brothers, your basically only choose which weapon to start the mission...
-It had that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing, if your pre-ordered with gold edition you got 3 or 4 days in advance which is a petty move to do in this days... no I will not pay more 30 Euros for skins and 3 days of early access.

Kharos,1,146.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKharos/,"This is one of those times when I wish there was a middle ground between Recommended and Not Recommended. Aside from what are largely circumstantial issues, such as the Epic Games integration and performance problems that some people are having, neither of which I have personally had a problem with; there are things that this game does right, and things that it does worse than the first game. I don't normally write reviews, and especially ones that are longer than a few sentences, but I feel like I have to say at least a few things about every general aspect of the game here.

To start with the good sides:
- Story: It serves its predecessor well, it answers a lot of questions with some subtle references which I really liked, and is overall well written, especially when compared to some of the recent 40k lore.
- Visuals: The sense of scale is impressive, the fidelity is as you would expect from a AAA title, and the animation work is unique in the sense that it doesn't necessarily copy from either Space Marine or Astartes, but has its unique take on depicting space marines which is fluid and satisfying.
- Audio: It's not on the same level as Darktide, especially in the soundtrack, but it gets the job done quite well in a lot of places. There are a few disappointing sounds, like the heavy bolter, but it otherwise manages to feel atmospheric.

Now the bad or mediocre sides:
- Gameplay: It's so hit and miss. When you break it down on paper, it sounds good, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The ranged combat is okay; the weapons are a bit too inaccurate during longer bursts for being carried by the superhuman warriors that space marines are, and most of them feel the same, with a lot feeling like they're less powerful than their counterparts in the first game, or fulfilling a purpose that another weapon can fulfill better. It's the melee combat that is the main problem. You're better off playing it like Dark Souls and rolling around, both in PVE and PVE, because parry is simply too inconsistent. It doesn't matter if you perfectly time your parry if you are already playing an animation, like an attack, because you cannot cancel that animation. This problem gets worse when the attacks, even for the knife and chainsword, are much slower and clunkier than their counterparts in the first game. Additionally, in PVE, enemies can interrupt your attacks by hitting you, but you cannot interrupt theirs using the same method, which makes it not only feel unfair, but also weightless. The animation-pause does more to hurt the experience than help, as timing gets offset every time you hit something. Finally, melee in PVP can be cheated easily by just rolling, kind of like you can cheat the PVE by just rolling. Do not even try for parrying, it's a gamble. All of this makes the combat feel unfinished or badly designed, and I really hope this is addressed because it is currently my biggest pet peeve about the gameplay.
- Customisation: Nonexistent for Chaos, and practically nonexistent for space marines. With Chaos, each class is limited to a warband, so if you're playing a raptor for example, you will be a Night Lord. You can change colours, but you will still retain Night Lord model pieces, same goes for the other classes and warbands. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist for Chaos. For the Primaris, it is also very lackluster. There are less options than there were in the first game, and they're lacking in the variety department, especially when it comes to chapter-specific content. Also, please, for the love of the Emperor, give us back Space Marines. Not Primaris. Space Marines. Not everyone likes the Primaris designs, and I certainly don't. But I feel like this would fall on deaf ears, it's not like GW ever listens to what the community wants.

Overall, it's a decent game. It's hard to judge because there are parts that are very good, and then there's a couple parts that are really bad, and it's hard to dictate which one outweighs the other because they're largely dependent on what the user expects from the game.",2024/9/6,en

Recluse,1,31.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrantoftheisles/,"Writing a review for non-Warhammer fans, so if you're into Warhammer, I'll just say that this game will probably scratch whatever itch you've got. Go for it. The game was literally made for you.

If, however, you're not somebody who's into playing as a tacky-looking action figure, fighting against barely-legally-distinct xenomorphs, then I'd like to give an honest review after my short time with the game to help you get a bit more of an idea.

Ranged weapon variety? Forget it. You, at time of writing, basically have four major options - some form of 'bolter' (every gun that fires bullets is a bolter, I guess?) that are all more or less very same-feeling, a 'melta' (fire shotgun), some plasma weapons that all differ very slightly from one another, and then sniper rifles. They all get the job done, but none of them feel particularly satisfying. Animation-wise, a lot of the larger enemies don't react to shots whatsoever, so these weapons don't feel particularly 'punchy.' I'd give the actual shooting experience in the game something like a 4/10 - clunky controls, weird aiming system (which is justified by the hybrid ranged/melee control scheme, but that doesn't make it any less weird and clunky) and a lack of visual feedback often just makes you feel like your guns aren't doing much, even if they are.

Melee weapons? That's the good part of this game. Many melee weapons, all with unique combos to learn and enjoy, and individualized strengths even though they, theoretically, should all pretty much do the same thing. They cooked here. 9/10 melee system, very good. Lots of focus on countering and dodges, or knowing how to pull off combos without getting your health bar torn apart.

General aesthetics? Look, I get it, some people adore Warhammer and Space Marines, but like... they're ugly. Horribly ugly. Like something a middle schooler would draw in the back of a notebook while they're not paying attention in math class. To make things worse, the game has you earn cosmetics - perfectly fine on its own! - and the cosmetics will be... a laughably tiny change. ""Congratulations, your reward for completing 40 different 30 minute long missions is - we put a strip of paper on your pauldron!"" Again, I'm sure this is something meaningful for the crowd that happily throws away thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on figures of these guys, but for somebody who isn't all that into it... it's just a strip of paper with a seal. Not a very good reward. Your best aesthetic customization is going to be in colors, and there you have more room to work with, but at the heart of your look you'll always be the same, really ugly action figure.

Highway_Crossing_Frog?,1,196.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973470717/,"I'm not a Souls-like player and I usually gravitate towards the medium difficulty settings of a game. So when I tell you that I find this game highly satisfying for the challenge it provides, take that as you will.

There are 3 primary game modes:

1) Campaign. The campaign is fun, but rather short. The game itself is highly cinematic, so it feels HIGHLY cinematic in the best way. Recommended to play with friends, as the bots are fairly incompetent when you need them most (the most annoying enemies, the mini bosses, and the bosses). There is very little replayability here, as none of the unlocking or leveling mechanisms in the other parts of the game apply to the campaign and it's very linear. But there are some amazing moments that I will literally never forget, so I recommend playing it.

2) Operations. This is a PVE setting somewhat akin to L4D or Darktide that I find to be the meat and potatoes of the game. On the scale of a lifetime gamer who does not revel in the hardest games or bragging about how good I am at hard games, I found this game mode to be VERY challenging. Here more than anywhere else, you will be forced to play a certain way in order to thrive. That said, the feeling of accomplishment I get out of winning rounds at the highest difficulties is very good, and there are a ton of crunchy weapon leveling mechanisms and class perks to fine tune.

A recent patch was released with some amazing free content, but also with a significant difficulty spike that catered to a loud minority of players. More than a mere difficulty spike, it sought to increase difficulty by making the player less effective rather than making the enemy more dangerous (it did some of both to be fair). The result for me was that I almost quit the game. Fortunately, the devs listened to the community outcry and reversed many of the changes in record time. To me the game still has not fully been returned to its former state of perfect balance, but I'm optimistic for future patches. Class and weapon balance is severely lacking (only 2 classes have effective ranged defenses, making the other 4 classes highly ineffective against the Chaos faction, which is heavily focused on range attacks for example). Still, on the balance, all difficulties are beatable and this game mode is fun and rewarding. When I need to let off steam, there is little more satisfying than parrying, pummeling down, and executing a Tyranid warrior or Lictor.

3) PVP. I'm not a huge PVP guy but I've played a few hours of it. I found it rather simplistic. You will play as a space marine or chaos marine, at random. Strangely, the incredible depth of customization that is available to your space marines is NOT available to you if you happen to get assigned Chaos Marines. There is a separate leveling mechanic in PVP vs PVE, which felt dissatisfying to me when I gave it a try after 100 hours of PVE.

Overall, this is a great game with a lot of flaws, deeply satisfying and often frustrating. The devs really listen to the community, which, as long as they don't revert to catering to the self-titled ""hardcore"" minority, can only lead to more positive growth.

Maybe, if we're really really lucky, we'll even get to play as Terminators one day.",2024/10/21,en

Fighting is a real strong point: fluid and satisfactory, with a good variety of weapons and enemies that push to adapt constantly.The story is well put together and offers great moments of adrenaline, all served by an epic soundtrack that strengthens immersion.

On the negative side, there are a few moments when action can become repetitive, especially during waves of enemies.In addition, certain aspects of orders could be better optimized on PC.

Gagoterapia,1,83.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198181878923/,"Pros
+ Space marine simulator
+ Both campaign mode and operations mode can be played in cooperative
+ Classes are very different from each other, with different skills and equipment, being able to improve or customize
+ Melee combat feels very satisfactory, especially eliminations
+ Sufficient complexity in the levels of operations to need strategy
+ Aesthetically the universe of Warhammer 40k is a joy
+ Although simple, it has PVP mode, which lengthens the life of the game

Cons
- The story of the campaign, although better than that of the first title, remains a bit soda (except the last mission)
- The customization of your space sailor is more limited than in Space Marine I (certain colors or chapters are paid)
- The 6 Missions of the operations mode know little

The campaign is short, but within the enough for the game proposal.With beginning, middle and end, it presents with memorable bases its characters.Its PVE is related to the campaign and stands out for being very challenging at higher levels.

Already the PVP, at least during the time I played, was a show apart.Extremely fun and no frills.All game modes are well done.

Perhaps the only negative point of this game is the lack of a soundtrack that made it even more unique in a pattern market.Definitely, Space Marine 2 is not here to please the pasta.Your only proposal is to be fun, and in this regard it is highly recommended.

Achievements/100%: Your 100% has nothing complicated, most will be farm.A highlight for the '' merciless '' achievement that can be the great hindrance to the compleitents in the future, over time it may be difficult to make the sequence of slaughtering PVP without dying.The achievement '' end with them '' it is recommended not to mark campaign enemies in operations mode (there is a possibility of not accounting for the enemy in Operations mode).As for the conquest of default 41k of enemies, there is a glitch in the very easy campaign to make this amount in a short time.

FROST,1,72.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/3206703627/,"I personally compare dishes, just an ordinary player.
At present, I only played PVE and wrote a little bit of opinion. I hope the big guy will not spray me.

I feel that the game is good and I can give a recommendation, but there are too many places to improve.


1. Add more difficulty levels. Now there are only 4 difficulty levels. I personally think that the span of level 3 to 4 is too large (maybe I compare the dishes) to add a level between level 3 and level 4.

2. Strengthen the player's weapons (yes, that is, all) including attack speed, damage, etc.
The Star Warrior was holding a shotgun instead of a BB gun, and a chain sawing sword instead of a branch in his hand.
There are almost no other weapons that can be used except for hot melt.
Ask everywhere how to fight 4, and the response to only get hot melt.

The specific method of strengthening:

Blasting the shotgun should strengthen the damage and add some range damage

(After all, it is a bomb, where the caliber is placed there, the 0.75 inches is almost 20 centimeters faster. It can imagine that a 20mm cannon has this damage.)

Strengthen the damage and overheating of the plasma/plasma gun

The plasma/plasma guns of my tactics and special warfare are unlocked. Due to the damage and overheating problems of the plasma/plasma gun, I can hardly see it now.
Especially the special combat plasma/plasma gun is too easy to overheat. I don't know if it is my problem, but I feel that it will be overheated without a few guns.

Strengthen the attack speed, damage and retreat of melee weapons

Strange can be strong, but can you squeeze the player in the middle when you let a lot of monsters rush to the face?
At present, I personally feel that I have not repelled this concept. I can only roll around by the monsters. I keep pressing the space and using invincible frames to escape.
The damage is also. Under the difficulty, hitting a knife ax, cutting for a long time is a bit useful, and the player must fall to the ground to cut a few times.
In terms of attack speed, why do so many people blow daggers .... Isn't it because they can't die, then increase the speed, anyway, the damage is not bad anyway.

3. Enhanced waist shooting
In a word, dare to ask the quasi of this waist shooting is to learn WOT next door?IntersectionIntersection
The bullets hit, like the shell next door, can be crooked and outrageous.


4. Add equipment system
Such as grenade bags, magazine bags, amulets, etc.


5. Improve the upper limit
For example, the movement speed is increased, the recoil decreases, or the damage is improved, etc.

6. Add more occupations
Think tank, pharmacist, etc.

7. I hope there can be more battles in the future, such as playing the Star Army or Chaos.

8. In the future, adding a large battlefield mode and adding a random terrain system. The model of the Jedi dive 2 is really in line with Star Warrior.

There are so many temporarily, I hope you can be happy in the game!",2024/9/9,zh-cn

■ Partial corrections and apology
You can play in story mode by inviting the Steam friend
It is impossible to cross play in story mode (invited PS user)
There is no story mode matching function

Limited, but cooperative play in story mode was possible
I'm sorry to post a review without verifying it properly
I apologize and correct it
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――


There is a lie in the product description.

It may be bad, but I feel that way
The previous work has not been played, but I was looking forward to checking the information before the release.
I watched a lot of introduction videos such as YouTube, but it can be said that this YouTuber was also dripping lies.

What is it?This work is not a cooperative shooter
[Protect the empire in three people cooperative play!] And the cooperation play that sells this game in the Steam introduction page
Or the phrase introducing a diverse department is dancing
In the videos of YouTuber, the introduction of each government, the evolution of weapons, the growth elements of improving the skills, and the armor staplation
I was sending fun information such as

They are not applied to Study Modes

I say again, but it is not applied
The story mode to sortie at a three -person party is a unique character of NPC except yourself.
There is no cooperation play
There are no elements of the above weapons, improving skills, and armor stamizes
The weapons used during the mission have another weapon across the movie scene
Special skills (power -ups and jump packs) are also automatically assigned for each story scene.
In other words, it is just to experience the story of Warhammer40000 alone.
The cooperation shooter with a growth factor is not said.

In the game mode called operations different from the story mode
You will play cooperative play that contains these elements
However, this operation is a system that feels gradually opened as the story progresses.
(Because the operation itself contains a story spoiler)
It's not a problem in the long run
People who are critical to the lies of this game are the most
The person who bought it with his friends in hopes of cooperative play like Halo or Gears

The main elements that advertise extensively are the characteristics of the game
I feel that it is very dishonest to be applied only to some game mode.

---postscript---
I made a relaxing story in about 10 hours
Characters and relationships that would be connected from the previous work
The hero's past is made on the premise that the player knows, and there is almost no explanation in the game.
So I don't know.

The general command of Ultramarine is also a friend of the player and the old knowledge.
I want to carry out an important strategy, but I can't get in touch with the general commander.
I can't give information other than ""big and strong""
A plenty of atmosphere with the skull on the Ultramarine fleet, and maybe one of the main characters.
At the end of the story, I remove the skull surface in a meaningful manner
The protagonist, Titus, reacts like ""You were you ...""
Players probably don't know 1mm.Because there is no information

After clearing, you will play ""Operation Mode"" with cooperation play elements.
To be honest, too much ...

For example, Halo and Gears have finished the long story mode with plenty of satisfaction.
There is a ""mode to enjoy the act of donpachi with the enemy"" like this work.
It was really purely the desire to fight against the enemy and enjoy it.

It's a special MAP prepared just for fighting, or an easy -to -understand area.
It was an enemy attack (WAVE) that is introduced at the right time

This work has a partially cut out of the progress of the story, but the details are different.
1.Where and where
2.Do this task
3.Finally defeat the boss

We will proceed with the progress of the same navigation as the story.
I feel like I defeat it because there is an enemy on the way

So I feel dissatisfied with the fact that there are various impurities between pure donpachi.
More like this, I sit down in one area and squeeze it with a hammer while keeping the hordes of enemies coming from one to the next.
It was good like that.

Furthermore, by clearing the stage, you will gain uniform experience and acquire tactical skills and custom equipment.
Various elements, such as ""number of enemies defeated, number of special kills, number of times they helped friends""
Because it is hardly reflected as an experience (very small)
It is not meaningful to defeat the enemy, even though it is in a mode that is wachawacha with the enemy, so it is more efficient to pass through and clear quickly.
It feels like a chiggle
In particular, there are many people who go through the enemies on the way and go quickly because they know that when they match with high -level people.


I don't want to get bored because it's still in the first play period.
But it looks a little tired
I feel like that

I hope that if you increase the difficulty and acquire skills, you may be able to get some fun.",2024/9/9,ja

If you have managed to avoid spoilers, you have absolutely no idea what is going on to you.
Every time you say: This is the most epic thing I've ever seen, the game can trump it.

- Variety of weapons and armor is cool
- Graphics are faint in cutscene, but the worlds are made absolutely unstable and your chin will fall from the scenery.
- Already in EA the game goes without any problems, stutters and falls.(So ​​far I have only played a solo campaign, I can't say how it is with matchmaking on COOP and so on)
- I have 4090 and 13900K, so I can't say too objectively as the game goes on weaker sets, but I think everything is fine in my opinion, just a little more demanding in more hectic situations.(I think the falls somewhere to some 55 fps at native 2K and the cleaned settings.
- Some steamers slapped that the game could be flew in less than 6 hours.I would like to see the passages ... It must have been more sweaty than me in the last 3 weeks.For a mortal, the campaign has about 11 hours as Devs complained.
- If you are a fan of 40k ... I would not hesitate.
The only minus and point down is possible the amount of content when you have a 11 -hour campaign and then 6 missions from which each other number of hours, but I would actually see it on such ... 30 - 40h before you unlock everything and startthat bored.

After playing for 2 hours, PVE has been refunded.
The key and mouse party, the buttons of the game can be said to be quite unreasonable. On the premise of melee attacks, anti -anti -anti, dodge, execution, shooting, and aiming at the premise (Left -button shooting, can the right button be changed to something else?), Even if it uses one click to switch the melee remote mode, it will not allow Nezha to do it.
Secondly, in terms of gaming, the sense of melee strike is almost the level of Lao Rol 5. It focuses on one of you who hit you and hit me. In the face of a group of miscellaneous fish with a samurai, there is almost no way to do it. Reasonable break of the game; there is no feedback on the fight against, and I do n’t know if I do n’t know if it ’s success or failure.
The long -range only played the shotgun series, and the fighting dogs must make up the gun, and the samurai immunohistan shotgun, humorous remote weapon, existed for the execution after the melee mark.
Self -explosive spores fry a tube of blood and samurai to cut off the semi -tube blood. If you don't know, I think I am a canned spinach.The amount of melee blood -sucking was not enough for me to be stabbed by the dog twice.

Warhamer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is in a good way, a typical sequel in which we find everything we liked on the original game, but in a more bombastic and more modern service.The fans of the first episode have nothing to hesitate about.In addition, I would also recommend the title to players who have affinity to Old-School-conceived shooters from the perspective of a third person, and those who would like to play Horde Shooter even in singleplayer.

Epic Doom,1,9.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/epic_doom/,"A masterpiece that is so rare in today's gaming landscape - reminiscent of a time we called the ""golden age of gaming"" with absolute Warhammer 40K brutality that we all love.

Graphics
• Incredible model detail everywhere
• High fidelity and dense environments
• Loincloth physics is 👌
• World just looks amazingly beautiful - sheer scale 'shock and awe' at every horizon

Gameplay
• Simple but satisfying, much polished from Space Marine I
• Movement feels super satisfying and heavy as an Astartes should
• Gunplay is impactful and smooth, though aiming feels a bit clunky at times due to the way it's configured
• Melee is a transcendent experience, as the Emperor intended, with all the right splashes of red
• Old school gaming feel, this plays like a true Space Marine successor/sequel should


• Well-paced, Titus, Chairon, and Chadriel have some amazing moments in this campaign to save the Recidious System from annihilation by xenos and Choas scum alike
• Background characters like Major Sarkaana, Cpt. Sevastus Acheran and others aboard the battle barge were all memorable in their own rights - though many Ultramarines don the same Primaris power armour their dialogues and faces behind the suit intrigued me enough to warrant their own spin-off campaigns if possible
• World-building elements in the story campaign created a larger-than-life immersive experience, thanks to the attention-to-detail when designing the objects in the game - everything feels so authentic to the 41st millennium time period
• Epic, grand, dazzling - are all words that are too small to describe the awe I felt when finishing the campaign, it was a religious experience to say the least
• Too short, would have loved a longer campaign - easily finish-able in a day. Hopefully future expansions could be added that bring fourth more stories in this game/engine.

Overall, this was the successor to Space Marine that was worth waiting 13 years for - in fact there was a time when this game would not have been possible and to see it and play it is a blessing and a great privilege. For anyone who is a fan of the 40K universe I say this is a must buy - my only complaint is that it will leave you wanting more.",2024/9/16,en

PonyKnight,1,36.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PonyKnight/,"I must say right away that I think the first part of a very overvalued, as it was just October WH40K, but the franchise was lucky only on strategies, so even such fans were insanely happy.Unfortunately, even among the strategies, the series began problems and the DOW3 was a complete failure.Last year, the wonderful Warhammer 40000: Rogue Trader, from the Russian studio Owlcat Games, the first franchise game in a long time, which was immediately good and the first widely known good franchise RPG.This year, another Russian studio (well, or what she is now on the papers) released Space Marine 2, a game that immediately came out without special jambs and, in principle, one of the best games of the year.


The main problem of the first part was in the monotony of everything, albeit with glimpses of the beautiful architecture of temples and other things.The second part fully corrects this problem giving levels on three different planets with a very detailed environment.If on the first planet we see mainly alien jungle, then in the second and third we are driven through the city, temples and places of burials.Even the main hub is incredibly detailed and changes between missions.In the multiplayer, as in the first part, we can open new parts of the armor and make a copy of your favorite figure out of our character.Enemies were also diversified, as in the first part, these are still 2 fractions, but with a much greater variety of classes of enemies.In the game, everything is done in detail and beautifully.It’s really not to complain about the visual, the developers clearly worked a lot on it and obviously with great love.


The plot is medium long, I think that in the area of ​​10+ hours.Plus, a few more cooperative sides of tasks (operations).The whole game can be gone alone and in the coop.Even on the highest complexity, bots are useful.They will kill enemies, if you need to revive, then this will be their priority and they do not die to the end.I would like to be able to command them to attack a priority goal, but these are trifles.In principle, cooperative missions are the same as the plot in the structure of levels, but with several new mechanics and classes (each has its own main skill and a set of weapons).Only one class representative can be in the team at the same time, which, in principle, can become a problem, but more on that later.PVP mode also uses separate classes with separate armor and other.In general, the game has a lot of content and for different taste.In the future, we are promised new weapons, skins, maps and years of support.Given how the game shot, you can not worry for this, but even just a plot and a coop cost your money.


Gameplay, the combat system is quite simple and, in principle, works.Near and long -range weapons are equally important.In many similar games, strong enemies make sense to kill only in a close battle, but in SM2, you often need to use a firearm and grenades, especially against enemies with distant attacks.For the most part, we dodge and parry the attacks, finishing with animations is needed to replenish the reservation, so you will often have to finish the animations and this is not enough, but in principle this does not become a strong problem.In the coope, the classes have trees of pumping, so the grind fans will do something in addition to opening armor and flowers.In general, as I said, the gameplay works and he is norms, not a new word in the genre, but also not dull.


I believe that the game has some problems with the balance on the highest complexity, the weakest enemies with distant attacks, too much inflict damage and very often.Zoanthropes are generally the strongest opponents in the game, which are too good in everything.But these are, in principle, not big problems, I consider the abundance of downloads a big one.In order to go into any game mode, in the beginning you have to boot into the hub of which you already choose what to play in the terminal.The hub, of course is very beautiful, but at the 25th hour I really want the opportunity to do it all from the main menu.You can’t configure normally normally, if you want to connect to the already started by the game or not, you connect to the team and only after that you see what classes they have, and as a result, the expectation of someone can change the class.I really hope that in the future it will be corrected.The second problem is that even in a single game you are always connected to the servers and if during a single company with bots you have chopped off the Internet, the game offers you to play offline, but throws you to the last control point, which is very annoying.


WH40K fans have been eating very well for the second year in a row.Not just a good game, but one of the best this year and generally one of the best in the franchise.With proper support, she will live with a large number of players for many years.One of the rare cases when the developers tried to make a bunch of everything and they did it.Of course I would like to have a in-game wiki for beginners, as if you will be rushed into incomprehensible words, but these are trifles.I hope that in the future, the main menu will add the opportunity to choose the modes of the game and so on, but otherwise, the gloomy future of the game looks very promising.",2024/9/14,ru

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a long -awaited sequel that is expected and followed by the fans of the first game.The action -packed and intense war atmosphere in the first game continues in this game, but this time new mechanics, advanced graphics and a deeper story.

Graphic and atmosphere
Space Marine 2 is visually impressive.The game successfully reflects the dark and gothic aesthetics of the Warhammer 40K universe.The atmosphere of the game is incredibly intense with detailed environmental design, huge battlefields and creepy designs of Tyranids.Thanks to the ""Swarm Engine"", which was previously used in the ""World War Z"" game, character animations and explosions look realistic and impressive.In particular, the blood and disintegration effects, which are used in abundance, make the Space Marine 2 into a visual feast.

Gameplay
In terms of gameplay, Space Marine 2 maintains the action -packed style of the first game.Again, as a Space Marine, you enter the epic battles against Tyranids.Using iconic Warhammer weapons such as close fighting weapons, heavy machine guns and plasma weapons makes war scenes even more excited.High -paced, bloody wars keep the spirit of the first game alive.However, thanks to the newly added combo and more fluent control mechanics, the fights have become much more fluent and enjoyable.

The diversity of enemies is also very impressive.Different species of Tyranids offer various war scenarios, each requiring different tactics.The huge boss wars add an epic feeling to the game.

Story and atmosphere
The depth of the Warhammer 40K universe is reflected in the story of the game.The story is shaped around our main character Titus, and we see it fighting against the Tyranide invasion.The atmosphere of the game gives a very gloomy and intense feeling with the combination of gothic sci -fi and chaos.This atmosphere will be a big plus, especially for players who dominate the Warhammer universe.

Multiplayer mode
As in the first game, the multiplayer mode is one of the most exciting aspects of Space Marine 2.It is quite satisfactory and fun to fight against huge tyranid herds with your friends.In addition, equipment and character customizations in cooperative mode diversify the multiplayer part of the game.The PVP is also a pleasant pleasant.Especially if you are bored of fast-pace games such as COD, low tempo, slow coveremen and team-based conflicts will be like medicine.

Conclusion
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a sequel designed to satisfy the fans of the first game and reinforced with new generation technologies.High -paced action, war scenes offering visual feast and the dark atmosphere of the Warhammer 40K universe makes the game a successful experience.Even for those who are not familiar with the 40K universe, Warhammer draws attention as an action game full of intense war mechanics and impressive visuals.

If you are looking for an action -packed third -person shooter game and if you are the fan of the Warhammer universe, ""Space Marine 2"" may be for you.",2024/9/14,tr

Why?
1.

2. The opponents only focus on you and run past your team yourself (if you play with bots)
3. The ranged weapons, despite their size, hardly do any harm.
4. Skills such as parrying/blocking are often not carried out.
5. Even a Space Marine prevented the smallest objects on the floor like a branch to carry out an alternative role
6. After the campaign, there are 6 missions that can be grown again and again for cosmetics and skill points to grint the same missions again for higher levels of difficulty.

However, i dont feel like a space marine when i play it anymore. The weapons don't feel impactfull, melee feels like a gentle massage on most of the enemies and a smal group of the weakest ones is capable of taking you down very fast and easilly.

Moreover, Saber Interactive, repeating the same mistakes of Arrowhead on the Nerfdivers fiasco, listened to the sweaty try hard minority of the comunity, and just released an update bumping up even more the dificulty across the board, Making you feel more like a guardsman than an Astates.

Not the game i bought, not the power fantasy i wanted to play anymore.

Recently i received an answer from the developer:

Brother Numitor [developer]  @ 7:02pm
Hello Cisco,

Thank you for the comments on the game. The feedback from our battle brothers is always welcome, and used for future updates of the game, and this time it'll be no different.

Also, I'm glad to inform that patch 4.1 fixed the balancing of the weapons in the game.

Please keep the comments coming, brother!

Initially this is a good, fun game but the higher difficulties were incredibly difficult which made me simply not want to bother playing anymore. Matchmaking didn't seem to work most of the time and the bots literally did nothing and armor would only protect a single hit except from the most damaging attacks which could take more.

Patch 3.0 changed the armor to work like you would expect, an extended health bar, and vastly improved the bots and made them actually do something. The game was suddenly way easier on the highest difficulties and you could actually progress. Honestly bots were usually better than the players I got matched with.

CaHkTyM,1,178.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198198450890/,"I am writing a review in support of the game in order to at least overshadow a large amount of heresy, which poured on this game from lodge heretics, because when I saw mixed reviews yesterday, I did not needle the co -ifigel.
Basically, negative reviews were divided into 2 types: the lack of support for large -format monitors and the flights that come complete with poor optimization, that is, apparently no one has complaints about Gamley, he is chic, everything is happy with everything.

1. The claim regarding the support of the widescreen monitors is not only heresy, but also the complete lack of desire to study the information, but as a result not to find out that the developers warned in advance that this very support would be added in the same month, so you either sit either, endure and wait, or do not buy the game until they add it, otherwise some were different here.

2. Next, we go to the problems of optimization and flights incomprehensible to me and many other people.When I read reviews that people with 30 and 40 series of video cards fly out and frisit game, then I fall out of this.Who are these people?Where do they come from?
Then I read positive reviews, people from the 20th, 30th and 40th series of video cards calmly play the game and do not complain, and the processors are not very different from those who write negative reviews, so many are also surprised at those who meet problems with optimization.And some, judging by the reviews, manage to calmly play in the GTX series.And I understand that it’s foolish for me to say something with my 4090 and i9-13900K, since I have a calm 110-125 FPS in 4K on the ultras and 70-80, but when I saw the complaints to the quality of it.Optimization, then it became bad for me.
And either it is a matter of an individual PC configuration, or people simply do not know what FSR and DLSS are, or these are really some heretics and adherents of chaos, but it is possible that this is just a combination of everything at once.

In terms of gameplay, the game is what you need, zaruba, meat, blood, purely run and make the local original graves from a third -person.The plot campaign for the time of passage and fullness is about the same as in the first part, in fact, it simply is, but it is also quite good.They brought a normal Russian voice acting, everything as promised, pleasant.Long -term PVE mode, or rather operations with pumping for nerds, I have it, I love it.PVP mode for me just exists, I have forced my love for a long time, but let it be, they don’t force him to play.If there are friends, then the buzz, it is more interesting to go through the plot with them, and to master the content more fun.
I myself am not to say that I am a huge fan of this universe and an unreal Loroveda, just an amateur and layman, I know something, something is not, and I can just only recommend this game, because, as far as I know, good games on Vahe come outIt is rare enough, and this is one of them.",2024/9/6,ru

SM2 is kinda like Gears of War or God of War I guess. Its core gameplay is fun but unfortunately very shallow and repetitive. It lacks any meaningful RPG mechanics. The story is short, not replayable, and you can't significantly customize your main hero. The squad mates are also not customizable, and are dumb as bricks. I did almost finish the campaign and it was alright, mid at best.


I also just put a few hours into the main ""meat"" of the game, which are the coop Operations. And yeah, I simply don't see myself continuing to play this. The levels are super linear, but movements is so slow and in combat you're stuck inside animations for half the time. Combat = parry simulator, and honestly the Batman games did this much better. Clearly the game was meant for console peasan...I mean players, and ported over to PC. It worked for them, the game sold a lot. But MKB feels terrible. The progression seems fine, but the loop is just not there for me.

Simplistic, shiny spectacle would be my best description of SM2. I wasn't familiar with the first game, so I didn't really know what to expect. Extremely overhyped by game reviewers, and I totally fell for it.

Runs well, looks good, but gotta give it a thumbs down. Game will probably settle in around Mostly Positive, which is exactly what it deserves.

For that Warhammer feel, for me personally, I'm just gonna go back to Darktide and Helldivers. For this type of combat, the Batman games are vastly superior as Bruce doesn't fight as if he weighs like a ton of bricks, sloshing his weight around in slow mo.",2024/9/10,en

Toner: A complaint from neighboring constellations was received - the planet Zablus turned into a den of frosts!Tyranids, that is, local drunk and drunkenness, flooded all the nooks and crannies and lay on the sidewalks, in spaceships, under the cosmostols ... They are thumping, rowdy, sing their moronic songs and require ""on the spacecraft"" at the expense of the institution.

And then there are chaosites, the most corrupted organized crime groups of the Galaxy!They bribe everyone, from small officials to old people on benches.And all this is only to drag your schemes and dump all all galactic budgets in your pocket!And who is the main opera who knows how to give out to everyone in fairness?That's right - Comrade Titishkin!

What about the graphone?The whole area looks like after the raid of cosmosaks, garbage bins burn around, broken glass shines, and there are whole barricades from empty bottles.On the planet, not a single whole corner - everything is broken, broken, as after a party of galactic students!

The gaples are generally not a fool!We have a complete set here - searches, raids, interrogations with elements of galactic folklore.Lupi on the back with a shocker, and if the suspect rustled, you can cut it on the head for prevention!And if you came across a chaos, a corrupt bureaucrat - arrange a raid, pull the Zhban into the site and apply administrative sanctions right on the spot!Tityushkin has two instruments - a rod and cosmocodex, and believe me, he has all the article!

What can I say ... Everyone yells into your ears - from drunkards to bureaucrats, but the louder of all, of course, Titishkin.It is such that it will not do without a megaphone: “We’re diverging, citizens of the cosmolate, otherwise I will begin to write protocols now!”

This video EGR is a real cosmodetic for connoisseurs of a calm and methodical gameplay!It's time to visit galactic taverns, put all the cosmopyanchugs in place and disperse all the galactic organized crime groups so that even the mouse does not slip past.On your wand, it is already glowing with a laser: “I serve space-narode!”, And these are not just words!

Both the design of scene art and interstellar warrior are very good in line with the style of war hammer 40K. For fans with 40K war hammer 40K, this may be the most circled and the number of war hammer 40K IP masterpieces.
The plot task process is about 8-10 hours, and the simple difficulty may be shorter

But the disadvantage of this game is also very obvious:
1. The plug -in of PVP still exists. The little lazy bear has not played any effective effect, but now it has become rare as the number of online people decreases.
2. PVE's low -character performance, such as the shield of paper paste that will disappear by the shield that will be interrupted, rolling without invincible frames, the mobs are caught twice.It also determines that failure, barrels and warriors, etc., can make players hard straight, etc.
3. The difficulty setting of the PVE is unreasonable. In order to increase the difficulty of N3 and N4, it is actually a rude multiples to increase the value of the monster and greatly reduce the number of supply.The location, and sometimes the team composition is mainly in the case of melee, and is forced to escape directly; however, the official announcement has said that the value of the monster will be reduced in the future.
4. There are too few PVE content, there are only six maps, and the high difficulty is basically only a specific two pictures.

In short, this is a better 40K game. Hammer powder can start. Even experience campaigns are a good experience

Gameplay is fine and solid, a pretty enjoyable combat system. Story is exactly what you'd expect, graphics are fine. That's about it.

Optimalization is very subpar.
Connection to online services is very spotty, you'll get stuck at loading screens, disconnected, the ping is not great, etc. It's all hosted on epic online services so go figure.
No FOV slider.
Veteran difficulty does not really make you feel like a space marine, one difficulty level lower is way too easy.

Tyranid section:
Enemies shoot through walls CONSTANTLY, that one elevator section in particular is awful - you have to one-shot it, otherwise after dying you cannot pick-up any medkits/ammo/weapons/etc., it all gets bugged. (reloading the level is not very optimal, the loading screens are so long)
The long-ranged enemies are insanely strong and don't give you too much indication that they are shooting at you. The bigger long-ranged enemies are bullet sponges.
The lyctor boss was underwhelming, repetetive and quite easy. The ""minigun/shotgun"" type enemies the boss spawned in were 100x harder than he was (they melt you down to zero HP in one good burst). They re-use him after as a normal enemy, actually much more fun.
The section with the small critters and the flamethrower was a cool concept but executed extremely poorly - it was more annoying than fun.
The flying enemies have way too much HP.
Teammates missing cutscenes, only see a black screen instead.
The bosses are so uninspired, filled with enemy spam because they are not worth it to fight on their own.

If you miss the mid 2000s games like Gear Of War you will love this one! No Coporate greed BS, no DEI, no ""suprise mechanics"", just big dudes killing big things. My updated review after completing the campagin on veteran and countless OP Missions: this is the best non-RTS 40K game out there at the moment! The last view fights of the campaign are the most 40K boner-material there is!!

Gameplay: Art, graphics, music, atmosphere are top notch. Its war everywhere, like it should be, the weapons have a punch, gore is deliciously over the top. Campaign is a little repetitive during the first half, a problem the first game had too. The second half of the game is amazing with new enemies, guns, locations etc.
Corporate greed/BS: No lootboxes, no microtransactions! Campaign can be played offline, OPs with bots.
Bugs: During the campaign I had one animation bug. Multiplayer was great, I had some connection issues once but thats it.
Balancing: The classes need finetuning in OP/MP, also some weapons.
Difficulty: Played campaign on veteran. Its a challenge sometimes, the defense sections can be hard, but otherwise than that its doable.
Multiplayer: Coop so far was VERY fun and this is where SM2 shines the most!

Verdict so far: To my knowledge everything is lore accurate, they went into great detail in this one. Big dudes with bigger weapons killing stuff, this is what I want to see! If you know 40K you will love this game, its a love letter to all the fans!

Great game, like a sip of fresh air, after summer without games.For the first time you go and see a good picture and large -scale battles of guards with tyranids.Huge locations, the infrastructure of the Imperium, the guards holding to the last - this is that it is very necessary for the Warhammer fan, you can look at the details for a long time, because there are a lot of them, even though the company is small.

In parallel with the company, there is a plot of PVE of missions and this is very cool.That is, not only Titus with a detachment cuts out 99% of enemies, other brothers from the order also perform no less important tasks, such as banging a tyrant of the hive or raising a ship and demolishing the artifact of thousands of thousands.There is an opportunity to fight with rubricates (finally not Nurlit), this is very non-standard.

PVP is not very, you need to finalize.Cosmetics are so -so, cool in certain classes of loyalists (especially in bastion, tactics and raener).The idea with the Legions of Chaos IMBA, but spoils its complete absence of cosmetics.The developers promise to add a lot and finish a lot to the game, so in anticipation)",2024/9/17,ru

For everyone who waited for the continuation of the story of Captain Demetrian Titus, Saber Interactive decided to prepare one of the biggest surprises when it comes to the premieres of 2024.Ultramarine dubbed by the fantastic Marek Strong returns, and with him and you will have the opportunity to face the greatest enemies of humanity in the Warhammer world embedded in the 40th Millennium.Is this a successful return?I will not expose myself to the Inquisition if I say - by all means!

The Emperor Protects!

Over 200 years have passed since the events of the first part of the game, during which Titus took its penance in the ranks of the Death Guard.In playable tutorial, we accompany him during one of the operations in which the hero almost loses his life, face to face with the overwhelming forces of the Tyranids and dueling with a huge Carnifex.The ""Emperor protects"", however, they are not words thrown on the wind, so our hero is put together on board the warship and once again finds a trace of the conspiracy of chaos forces.

The story skeleton remains similar to the one we know from the first part.Fighting with Tyranids turns out to be an introduction to the invasion of chaos, and reckless fun with the relics of the warp, which are done by priests Adeptus mechanicus, as they do nothing, they remind the player similar inquisition practices from the first part of the adventures of the Space Marine.The action rushes so rapidly that instead of thinking about the meanders of the script and so you will rather rush with the hammer and bolter to fight, so instead of looking for holes in the whole, it is better to look at what is the most important part of the game - fight!


Aliens will cut, crush and tear to shreds with a quite large arsenal, definitely larger than in the first part.In melee combat you will use four different types of weapons, there will be several types of lateral weapons and a dozen major rifles and thrills for a short, medium and long distance.

Arsenal quite substantial, but the size is justified if you look at who we will fight with.Somehow the creators managed to prepare even greater clashes than in the first part, and thanks to the skills of Titus, throwing even at several dozen enemies at once you will not feel flawless.A mix of struggle in a metering and use of lateral weapons will not only provide constant pressure on opponents, but in sensitive moments executions on enemies will renew the life and armor of our hero.Fight is a real visit to the slaughterhouse - blood bursts in all directions, cut off limbs and torn bodies will be densely under the feet of the powerful armor of our hero.

I remembered the first part of the game myself as a fairly monotonous break through the next waves of opponents.In my opinion, the two is definitely more dynamic, and the greater number of the hero's abilities in melee combat, weapons and diversity of the mission makes us feel involved all the time in what we see on the screen.


Noteworthy is both the graphic and sound design - in my opinion, both really make a great impression.On the screen swarms enemies, both in the air and on earth, the Tyranids storm the positions of the Imperial Guard again and again and try to interrupt our hero and his team.This is obviously accompanied by suggestive sounds of explosions, screams of enemies and allies.Bolter ribbing, air -piercing the sound of lasers and wrapping into the ground of a powerful electric hammer season the shivers on their backs, and if we add really nice dubbing and actors who speak their issues with commitment, we get a really successful mix.


- a bloody shave without a handle;
- satisfying fighting;
- improved shortcomings of the first part;
- nice graphic design;
- great sound setting;

- too clearly repeats the story scheme of the first part;
- occasional problems with connection with other players;
- some development of Titus's ability could be useful, and not just the accompanying warriors as part of the operation;
- no side activity in the operational base;
- relatively little mission in the Operations mode (although new ones are still coming);",2024/9/9,pl

Hopefully it doesn't get broken with another patch again. If it does, at least now I can trust it will be fixed.
The game is very fun and has just so much cool set design; really nails the whole 40K aesthetic. And I love running into stuff or hearing someone talk about something in the lore and then being able to explain it to my Warhammer-novitiate cousins and they go ""Ohhhh that's so coool!"" In tonight's session, the older one noticed a servitor plugged into the wall as he was walking past and he was like ""Woah guys guys come look at this! Its the most messed up thing so far; he's like plugged into the wall!""

Original negative review after patch 3.0:
I love this game soooo much man, it hurts me to leave a negative review. This 3.0 patch really messed it up for me and my cousins though. It crashes like every 5 minutes now. And one of them was playing on a Steam Deck and now it doesn't even let Linux users login for online play any more? It worked before the patch just fine and we had already played through the first 2 story missions and the first Operations mission. Just wasted 3 hours TRYING to play through more of the story. First had to install it on a spare computer so the Steam Deck user could play. Now every time we go into a mission it works for about 5 minutes then crashes. Whole game freezes, white screen, windows does the whole ""This program isn't responding"" thing. Just so disappointed right now.

Lucky us. Can't recommend for a sixty dollar price tag, unless you wait for some patches when you can't even get out of the opening without troubleshooting.

Edit after 15 hours played.

The sluggishness in the cinematic cutscenes can really dampen the intended effect of awe at the things you get to see in this game up close from the amazing 40k universe. The game is worth it.. but maybe wait a while for them to fix some of their bugs, since their mentality seems to be they believe it's ""rare"" to encounter these issues. Both me and hubby ran this and had the same exact issues on completely different machines, and when you see you've experienced every issue on their bug list that has ""rare"" listed for the bug occurances as much as there are bugs in the game.. well.

For anyone having the same issue I and hubby had with the game where it wouldn't load the first opening cutscene, among others. Try disabling any overlays you have including steam overlay. Game doesn't really seem to like it much. Good luck fellow Astartes, The Emperor protects.

The update and optimization of the game should not bring players a better experience code?Why is the game update more stuck and unstable than before.There are some settings that make me unbearable.
In the first point, level 4, and fifth level difficulties, why must I leave all the players and walk together. I am obviously the Star Warrior 2, not the three -person trio of the war hammer version.Many weapons and skills mechanisms must open their distance with teammates in the battle and provide cross -firepower.For example: the plasma weapons of the special warriors and the laser of sniper.The huge body shape of Star Warriors can easily stop teammates' gun lines.There is also the jumping backpack of the assault soldiers. His professional positioning must go to the back of the enemy to strike the key target.

Don't be so useless.

Third, you still have to talk about the stability of the server. It may trigger a drop or collapse in one or two hours.The victory that was about to get into the instantly turned into a bubble, as the only last monk in the team's hope in the team.Directly lead to the failure of the battle.Everyone is not a sage who is in the heart, and the sky is not shocked.Are you testing the player's blood pressure?Summary in one sentence: disgusting!Too disgusting!IntersectionIntersection

The games are teeming with details that will delight the real fan of the GW universe.
The campaign is magnificent, there are so mythical scenes that some times I pushed vasts, swept away in these specific moments.
The operations mode is really an interesting addition to the scenario because it is linked to certain campaign passages.
The multi is quite simple, too bad the balance between the classes is not at the top, but the updates should solve this problem.
Beware of the difficulty, it is quite high and it is a fairly demanding game when it comes to control of its actions, the enemies are legion and devious, they will tend you ambushes and you will very often be surrounded by all sides without the possibility of folds;We are clearly in a hardcore gamers category ... so if you are Plûtot ""casual"" go your way where you can never enjoy this game.

Bravo to the team of designers, Pax Imperialis!",2024/9/17,fr

Pros:
1. The game is very beautiful, the Grim Dark style linked to Warhammer 40K is well represented.The Lore is friendly and the Environment Design is very successful but ...

AGAINST:
1. A laziness level design.The missions and the campaign always have the same diagram (corridor → arena → corridor → arena ...).
2. sometimes long but acceptable loading times.
3. A perfectible camera locking.
4. ... which fades after a hundred times.In addition, in veteran mode, it is almost necessary, to do executions to avoid damage.Because there are few cutlery and care is almost nonexistent (in veteran mode) except the special capacity which is not often available).It may be much easier ... in easy ...
5 .... A high difficulty, weapons are traffic jams on enemies other than small mobs.In addition, regardless of the chosen firearm, you see almost no difference.
6 .... it's not bad compulsory to play in contact.
7. ... Unfortunately too few and not representative of the game.

A class with a shield is a separate type of autism, how do you not try, which weapon do not use it to the phh*ru, they just stand and absorb damage, for example, girls have an energy shield that breaks down why you can’t make a stamine at the thyroid gland so that it is like yes*N did not stand with a clamped block button or that the percentage of damage from getting over time increases?But apparently there was no desire to think about PVP mode!

I hope they will work on PVP and develop as I would not want to quickly forget about this game!

Seth Brogan,0,42.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sethamphetamemes/,"Campaign was good, graphics good, story good, operations good, pvp good. But I have one major issue with the game's progression of difficulty. Its feigned, or poorly executed.

TL;DR: Game felt good at first, but as you progress in difficulty, it loses it's shine.. The game's enemies don't increase in number, rather they increase in health as you go up in difficulty, so the enemies are spongier, not harder. This paired with the mechanics of survival on higher difficulty ruined the game for me.

Full explanation:

Instead of throwing more enemies at you, or more variety, they just make the enemies spongier, (give them more health and resistance to stagger.) Same enemy, same moves. Just now it takes 2-3 mags of ammo, instead of 1. Guns feel under powered/useless at higher difficulties.

On the 1st or the 2nd difficulty, you feel like an Astartes, you feel powerful. You charge into combat, your teammates don't need constant supervision. Your weapons feel powerful. Knock it up to 3 difficulty, everything still feels good, weapons are okay, but melee seems more effective.

You hit difficulty 4, all of a sudden your guns feel pretty weak, even gold tier, max perked weapons. Dumping full mags into enemies skulls, and having to reload before they give an execute window. Enemy attacks can nearly wipe your health bar, with one hit. (Speaking about Majoris/Extremis here, the small enemies are never really a huge issue, even on max diffy). Juggling armor charges becomes a chore.

Playing on 5's isn't even playing the same game. No longer do you feel like an Astartes charging into combat, now you're literally just running around scrounging for life stem's and looking for the ever scarce ammo,(which is now even more limited with caps on uses), for a gun that feels useless. All of this while probably roll spamming to wait for your teammates re-spawn timer. This was 9/10 of my 5's, just running for your life, while praying your teammates are doing the same and not dying.

Final Take:

Game was a blast for 40 hours, but if I gotta play like a b!$%# to play on the higher difficulty, that's not fun. Ill still play a 3-4 with friends, but it feels like a chore as I know this game is gonna end up in the uninstalled folder after month or two.",2024/11/8,en

The continuation of the ultramarine adventures did not disappoint.The action is intense, full of amazing moments that make me feel like the Emperor himself led me to battle.The fight against the hordes of the Tyranid is a pure pleasure for every fan of this world.Animations, sounds, and especially the design of enemies and environments, reflect the dark and Gothic atmosphere of 41 Millenium.Every step of the hero - from Bolter's roar, through majestic explosions, to the sound of heavy space marine shoes on a metal surface - reminds me why Warhammer 40,000 is a universe full of amazing depth and a unique atmosphere.

The game mechanics have been improved in relation to the previous part.New movements and liquidity in combat allow you to feel like a real Astartes - superhuman fast, strong and ruthless.To this, let's add epic clashes that show the vastness and complexation of Warhammer's battles.

Most importantly, Space Marine 2 is not just a action game - this is an experience that allows you to feel the pride and glory of Ultramarines who guard the Empire.Warhammer universe fans will definitely be delighted, seeing how faithfully devoted Lore, and new story threads only deepen the interest in this fantastic world.

A story that sticks to the core of 40k, the beautiful, immersive set pieces. This is THE 40k game I've been waiting for. The combat system has taken some time to get used to, but there's nothing more satisfying than pulling off a chain of executions and heavy hitting slams into the horde that surrounds you (before you turn the entire place into a red mist). And it's not just the melee. The ranged weapons have the most satisfying bolter punches I've seen in a 40k game yet.

The multiplayer PVP mode could use some balancing, and the campaign AI really needs a tweak or two, but this is something that nobody is a stranger to at this point. It's an expected headache when you make gameplay surrounding co-op and then give us robots with the brains of a sloth to back us up.

Tanvaras,0,56.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tanvaras/,"Release version - Worked well, fun game with friends.

Newest Patch - Nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf..... Still a huge NO from me, friends have already moved on, many issue still around. Should of been boosting useless skills and weapons and not nerfing good things. Gawd help solo players.

Older patch - Infinite black screen on mission launch. Talk about cocking up their game.

Co-Op missions (affecting my friends and I), Launch mission, Load into black screen, stumble around in the dark to find the launch area again, if we get lucky mission might start. But then loads incorrect mission to what we chose. Very poor Quality Assurance on Sabers behalf to release such a poorly done patch.

Currently the Dev's have no clue on which way to go with this game, tweaking balance to the complainers about how hard it is (its not hard) and now this patch makes the game unplayable for quite a few.

We'll see if the Dev's can fix this asap, and I might thumbs up this review. But as it stands, releasing a patch not ready for release was a very bad move.

I don't hold our for much to change, its radio silence from the Dev's on Steam, which is a shame really. Wont be buying another product with this type of support from Saber unless they can start being active and actually fix the issues that matter, and worry about dumbing down the game later on.",2024/9/27,en

FaceRekt,1,119.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FaceRekt/,"An excellent game with some performance issues on lower-end pc's (I'm still rocking a 1080Ti because GPUs are stupid expensive still).

Pros:
- This game *nails* the 40k aesthetic and environment better than any game before it - even Darktide.
- 3 game modes on launch. Even if Eternal War has some server issues, having more options on launch is good. Operations will get fleshed out further based on roadmap being posted by devs, so there'll be even more content to dig through later.
- Combat feels pretty good! The default control scheme on mouse and keyboard is a little whack, but you get used to it (or you can change it). Only thing is you *will* get animation trapped sometimes. It just happens.
- Visceral executions are a delight to watch

Cons:
- Story is fine I guess, any complaints I have are spoilers.
- Enemy variety is a little low.
- The AI for your two squadmates in solo-Campaign are *not* okay. They suck ass. Will frequently not target enemies, not execute stunned enemies, will not target enemies attacking objectives, sometimes won't even res you if you go down. Play with friends, or play on Easy (game doesn't have achievements for beating campaign on set difficulties, just for beating campaign at all) because playing on the hardest difficulty without friends has a few very acute pain points in the story. Otherwise, game isn't actually that hard.
- Eternal War (PvP) mode is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Time to kill is way too short, and there seems to be no rails on who you can get match-making into. So if you're a new guy into the PvP mode, you can get matched with people with all - and I mean *all* - the unlocked gear and get totally ♥♥♥♥ on until you catch up. Which can take a while, given you're getting ♥♥♥♥ on. This mode needs a rework, ASAP.
- The pay to get early access was scummy. Wish companies would stop this ♥♥♥♥.
- Performance issues; I've got an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 16GB of RAM, and a 1080Ti. Game runs well enough but has some serious hangups once in a while even on Low settings. Possibly just lag from people joining/leaving sessions, but it's hard to tell if it's my hardware or the network. I'm overdue for an upgrade, so this might be an entirely *me* problem.
- Solo queueing into Operations is a similar annoyance in lack of team cohesion that solo-ing into LFD2 or *any* co-op PvE will bring you. People will run ahead, ignoring enemies, letting teammates die, just to try and run the level as fast as possible. Annoying as ♥♥♥♥, as it always is.

In addition to the plot, there are 6 operations that occur parallel to the main plot.You can play with bots, but it hurts to play the difficulties above normal with bots, because they are stupid, do not finish enemies, do not capture points and do not perform various plot actions, and one thing is difficult to have everywhere.Therefore, I recommend playing in a cooperative.Fortunately, the selection of players is quickly.
Multiplayer battles in the classics are fast and simple.Although now there are players who perfectly studied locations and pumped their fighters.But pumping is a matter of time.Just play and enjoy.

DELTA ㋛,1,44.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DELTICH/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a purebred video game that is not ashamed to be what it is.Your goal is to just come and destroy everything in your path, nothing more.At the same time, the developers took a bold step, completely abandoning any pumping of a hero or weapon in the plot campaign.If you are tired of the next anniversary and other modern games, where for five minutes the gameplay accounts for 30 minutes of digging in different menu, so that the impact power becomes 1% more, and you just want to chop the mobs to parts with beautiful graphics and a steep fighting - SpaceMarine 2 is for you.

Space Marine II works on the Swarm Engine on its own engine, and this is perhaps one of the few games that finally demonstrate the very “almost non-nectogen”.From the details of the environment, the armor of the characters, the range of drawing, amazing lighting and the scale of the game, sometimes simply breathtaking.One of the most noticeable changes in the game is its visual design, detailed models of characters and surroundings, gloomy, bloody landscapes and epic and large -scale scenes of battles create an indescribable atmosphere, which perfectly corresponds to the spirit of the Universe of Warhammer 40k.The sound design is also at a height - dynamic and tense battles are accompanied by powerful sound effects and grand musical accompaniment, which makes each battle even more memorable.The developers also took into account the criticism and reviews of players about the first part, introducing a number of significant improvements.One of the main innovations was a cooler and deeper fighting.Now players have to face even more diverse enemies, each of which requires a special approach and strategy.The system of pumping the characters was also significantly expanded, providing more opportunities for customization and development of the hero’s skills (but this is mostly done for a coope, for the campaign, just a choice of weapons was made, and 2 two types of armor, if you have Delux publication).

The plot in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 stars from the sky is not enough, but it has become more saturated.He continues to develop the history of the original, but at the same time introduces new elements that add depths.The characters, both new and familiar from the first part, received more worked out stories and motivation, which allows players to plunge deeper into what is happening.You can describe the whole plot literally in two sentences, since the story here is more likely to blow something up and destroy someone.Most of the tasks boils down to the fact that the heroes should lay a bomb, draw a gun or prevent monsters from destroying an important object, and the main conflict develops against the background, only in the final third makes itself felt.In principle, the plot in the Warhammer universe is not required.

If you summarize, the new Space Marine in 2024 looks like an ideal militant in the world of Warhammer 40k, like a genre Messiah, with a bolter in one hand and a pilome in the other.The new part undoubtedly justified all my expectations and brought many innovations that make the game not only with popcorn and meat spectacle with excellent graphics, exciting sound design and improved mechanics, but also represents a worthy continuation, so to say the “successful” original.If you are a fan of the Warhammer 40k universe or just like high-quality action games like Gear of War, this continuation is definitely worth your attention.Despite a number of shortcomings spent in the SPACE MARINE II plot campaign, 10 hours gave me one of the most pleasant impressions in 2024 - this is exactly the last five years for us.",2024/9/7,ru

Where is the agenda?Why are there no women Astartes?!


Play only at the highest level of complexity, seriously!


Meat game, a great continuation of the first part!
This is if in a nutshell, then in the game.
The beginning, for me personally it was unexpected, from the landing of the Cauls of Death Council!Where are the ultramarins?!
And only when our cosmodes took off his helmet, everything fell into place :)

It is simply impossible to convey the delight from the meat cut of tyranids!Especially if you play the jastics from the PS5, feel the resistance of the trigger with each shot, the vibration when running to every step adds the feeling of the severity of space -cosmodes, the relics of the bolter!





When at the beginning of the game you are shown the swarm of the Tiranids running, somewhere there in the far, it doesn’t bother you much, this is the background, right?After all, so?!
But as this huge crowd approaches, you understand that this is not a background, that these are not static boobs, this is a really huge crowd of enemies that you need to dig out alone!And they will not stop the high walls, they are like those zombies from the film with delirium Petrovich, these xenos will simply build a living staircase and come for you!





In the first hours, I was dying more than once, but this did not scare me off to transmit to a lighter difficulty, on the contrary, the action is so perky, bloody, brutal that I want hardcore!
The fighting is not very complicated: there is a chain sword or a knife for close combat, there is a bolt pistol and a full-fledged bolter, and of course there is a dodger and parrying.
Tactics of battle:
While the enemy is far away, we shoot from the bolter.
When it’s close, the bass with a sword, we parry, restore HP.
Restore armor with finishing off.

By the way, the parrying kills a trifle immediately, and a more serious enemy for a moment, for our attack by a chain sword.Here is the finishing of a large game is especially bloody!Then the cosmodes will tear off the claw of tyranid and put it under the rib, then the spine will tear out, then he will trample the head ... Brr ... tin!





The graphics here are not bad, that is not bad, not perfect.As for me, graphics, it could be better, but this is my opinion.
Yes, there are a lot of graphic trifles, blood flows through the armor and a cloak of GG, the dirt clings to the boots of the armor and spreads to the sides of the thunder dial, the explosions, the elements of the armor are quite detailed.
BUT!On the first planet, the flower crown is such a strange fading gray .... When you go into the buildings, the brightness of the flowers returns.I don't know, I can do it wrong in brightness)

On my not a top bucket, the game goes with subsidence up to 70 FPS at maximum settings (with the exception of blur in the movement, turned off for nafig).

At the time of writing, connect to the servers, that’s still a quest.Therefore, the company is held in offline mode.But as soon as the game starts for the standard of publication, I will pass (or may already reproduce) a company with a friend.

PVP mode has not yet watched, perhaps I will supplement the review later.





I took the ultra publication and did not regret it!
The game costs your money, Komon guys, this is Waha!
A beautiful picture with decent optimization.
Exciting, blood-and-frotted battles with crowds of tyranids, an interesting design of locations saturated with a 40th millennium.

Ska3o4nuk,1,171.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086745517/,"The emperor protects this game

I have come across YouTube more than once thought that Russia is Warhammer 40k.And however, we have something like that from Wahi, a lot of intersections.This game only proves how much Russians subtly feel this universe, because this game was developed by developers from St. Petersburg and at the moment - this is the most successful and best game on Warhammer 40k.And before that, other Russian developers have made a cool RPG Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader.Russia knows how and can when it is allowed.It is ironic that the British came up with Warhammer, and it is the Russians who perfectly understand it.

Why is the game so good?And let's understand.

1) The absolute absence of a Western political agenda, which at the genetic level is alien to Russians, as for the children of the emperor, the ideas of xenos are alien to.There is only Warhammer 40k in their dirty and gloomy splendor, no non -warrous personalities, nasty feminists and no one scolds Donald Trump.Yes, in this game they give us to play for the team from white, black and Asian, who, after passing the game, become like relatives.And so it was possible?Of course, you just need to register and serve the characters so that people like them.That's how simple as it turned out.

2) overcoming.What is this game is complicated, it is perfect perfectly by this the spirit of the universe.There is a coope in the game and it is not added here for a checkmark, it will be hard without it.So that you understand that the game has additional missions for another detachment of spaceport, this is PVE, which is imprisoned for a coope.If you try to play without brothers with bots, then even on the most minimal complexity, get ready to overcome and fight at the limit of your capabilities, for Tyranids and the Order of thousands of sons will literally destroy you.And this is after a patch, in which the difficulty was reduced, and the “director”, which, as in Left4dead, generates random skirmishes with enemies, reduced aggressiveness.I am scared to imagine what hell was going on on the maximum complexity before the patch, it was probably easier to win the gods of chaos than to pass it.

3) Visual.The game conveys the spirit of the universe with its appearance.Huge industrial buildings, no, not so, huge industrial buildings.Paphos, no, not so, pathos.You look at this and do not want to be there for any money, which is absolutely right, because Warhammer 40k is a nightmare in which there is only a place for suffering.

4) Oda to militarism and brotherhood.The game perfectly conveys the spirit of partnership and sensations of himself part of something immense, which is the Imperium.If before this game you did not know about the emperor, then after the game the word ""emperor"" protects ""will become part of you.The game conveys the concept of ""heroism"" by all 200%, there are real soldiers who are ready to give all themselves in the name of their race.The Cadians are generally handsome, run such small space -breeds, and they have no less courage than the angels of the emperor, in whom fear is specially turned off in the brains.

5) gameplay.This is the same classic DOOM meat.The weapon makes ""bang-bah"", and the enemy turns into minced meat.What else do you need for happiness?You feel the weight of the armor, what are the cosmodes heavy.And the enemies are really felt by a threat, for which the Imperium became so cruel, having built a vertical of power and unscrewing the ideology of militarism to the maximum.It’s not a shame with such enemies to be f*with a wool, but very reasonable.

6) the hordes of enemies.I love this technology that allows you to make a lot of enemies on the screen.We could see her before in the stunning dilogy of the games A Plague Tale, where there were hordes of rats.And here instead of rats we have tyranides, which are many times more dangerous and larger.This is a really impressive sight that you also have to fight.

7) Tit.The main character, he is a white cisgender man of a natural, who is not some kind of insignificance, but a really great hero who, even in the conditions of the Imperium, remains a good person.Lord, I have already forgotten with these Western games that it happens.Titus is very cool, he is immune to the influence of the warp, and he is also a saint, for the emperor himself talks to him.This means that he can play an important role in the universe, I personally think that he can close the great break, sharing the Imperium into two halves.God forbid, if the western agenda once wounds Titus and Warhammer 40k, I conjure the fans of the universe to fight against this disgrace.

Does the game have minuses?I did not notice them.True, I have nothing to scold the game for.Everything is played perfectly, the waha is transmitted in all its glory, the plot is simple and at the same time interesting.The price/quality ratio is excellent.Can the game interest not only fans?Of course it can, this is a cool meat jumper, the language of meat is understandable to any gamer.You can not miss this game, you must definitely play this.",2024/10/3,ru

After this audit and adjustment, the quality of the armor was improved, and it was also confirmed that the problem of the power armor's protective film was completely resolved if the battle-brothers were not in close contact with the battlefield.This is a hope that we needed to embody the will of the emperor at the forefront of the battlefield, and accepts it as a signal that proves that the empire has not abandoned the will of us and the emperor.Nevertheless, we are aware that there is still a way to go further.

We could confirm that the quality of the bolt to be used for the baller was also improved, but it is not enough to thoroughly clear the enemies of our Astartes, especially Chaos, heresy, and the evil beings of aliens.In the temple for the prosperity of mankind and the stability of the empire, it is again emphasized that the Bolter weapon needs to have the quality and power that is more suitable for the mission.Plasma weapons and Melta weapons have been excellent until now, but plasma and Melta weapons are not as versatile as Volters, and they can't always use them.I hope you remember that the leading role of the Astartes firearms has always been a ballter from the glorious times to now.

We welcome the decision of the Imperial head and evaluate the decisive will shown in this audit positively.Through this continuous implementation of this midnight effort, I believe that greater corruption can be prevented in advance, and that the empire can fulfill its true devotion to us and the emperor.We expect the empire to make a wise and decision -making judgment in the future, so that the emperor's warriors can be prepared to complete their duties.

As always, we will be the guardian of mankind and the judge of justice and fight for the emperor and the empire as the guardian of mankind and the judge of justice.We are always ready to join the empire's midnight and improvement as a faithful servant of the emperor, so that corruption is rooted under the name of the emperor, and greed does not shake themselves, humanity and its great empire.

🐒Monke🐒,1,64.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MasqueicoMonke/,"First and first of all, maybe this analysis is skewed by the simple fact that I enjoy the W40k universe has a long time, but let's go to the simpler questions (which usually the person wants to know when reading ssasporcaria):

Is the game good?Yes.

Is the game heavy?Okay.

Is it worth buying?If you have the money and you won't spend on more important things for sure.

Is there a lot of customization anyway?It has, but I found it somehow limited to some things (for example wanting to paint a certain part of Power Armor but not power because it was well ""widespread"" to coloring), and of course they have basically put all theCustomizations such as ""buyable"" with points you earn when you play missions in operations mode, something else, a business that I found in a way ""Paia"" was the fact that you will not be able to paint the chapter champion armor (in this caseThere are only overseas so far but most likely it will be worth it to release in the future too).

Which version is worth taking?Dude, it depends on whether you like the franchise or not, Season Pass that is given in Gold will be more to get new customizations than anything else, if you get the ultra just take if you think you play with a minigun (or someAnother heavy trabuco) Style The TF2 Heavy is cool/fun (the class is cool but I prefer to play full melee), I would recommend taking the standard if you are not someone who already enjoy the W40k universe/thematic.

Can you play solo or is it mandatory to have a friend to play together?Bicho, you can play solo, the bot is kind of dumb but it helps.The game to play with friends is very good, and if you want to play the ""Operations"" mode that is the PVE mode of the game (outside the campaign), matchmaking is very fast, not to mention that it has PVP modethat there are a lot of people playing at the moment.

Do you have a lot of variety of weapon?More or less.Currently there are the ""stamped stickers"" of the franchise, some of them are kind of corner because there are stronger weapons (kind of not so balanced) in the future, what they spoke and Roadmap, new weapons will be added, so justwait.

Is the campaign too long?Man, from what I have seen, not so much, it's 20 -hour talk to what it seems (this with you taking your time and playing in calm), despite that, for what I played, I enjoyed the course of the story and progression.What will give the game longevity is more PVE mode and PVP.


(Only an addendum, as I said, the game is very heavy, and apparently has some bugs such as invisible enemies and/or your character also invisible, I personally have not witnessed any bugs so far, game is running good (despitethat my pc is a why to run the game))

Not that's it.",2024/9/6,pt
Deal_Pickle,1,23,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198121189481/,"I have difficulty knowing where to place this game ... The story is good and the graphics super, but the game is nothing other than a release in an ultra linear world ...

I probably ask too much, or was it our technology, or the time that limits developers, but the Warhammer universe is gigantic!And I find that all its potential is only explored 1%...

The story campaign is an epic adventure for 8 hours, as in the good old, without meaningless running around in the open world and collecting unnecessary trash (Hello, ubisoft)
Visual and optimization are my respect, a very beautiful game.The corporate pathos is felt literally in everything.
Joining enemies are juicy, plus them quite a lot that pleases.
In my opinion, the W40K Laura was also respected - it’s nice to see references and familiar details.

But not everything is as rosy as it seems at first glance, so if you are not a fan of ""wahi"" pay attention to the following shortcomings of the game at the moment:

- Lack of content.I took pre -order and gave it for the game 4.5k.In my opinion, the game is not worth that money.Wait until it is filled, or take it at a discount.
- A terrible network code.He played with friends, there were frequent breaks, long downloads and the inability to connect to the network.I heard that all Saber games had such problems, I hope to correct it.
- PVP mode is boring, a la, ""as in the zero"", ""to be"" - not everyone will come in.

Next, let's deduct points
The only special martial arts or wolf cubs from the family's hair from the home of the Killing Team from the beginning of the killing team originally thought that after being the original P Starmer's warrior, I could give me the whole point of atonement and expected the technology and ruthlessness that I haven't seen in 100 years.Live, then turn on the weapon library to see the slow firing speed shotgun, fast shooting shotgun, big magazine burst shotgun, mirror explosion shotgun, three -point shooting shotgun and bomb -preparation very few shotgunsEssence
Well, after finishing the plot, the motion mode is realized that those humorous shotguns are all used for funny original P toys. The entire game can be used in two guns, which are hot melt and multi -tube hot melt without bringing with hot melt without bringing with hot melt without bringing it with it.The hot -melt original P was drowned in the shit of the nest's waterway. This is the self -confidence given by the original P weapon library, Kiliman!Dola!Where is my ammunition?IntersectionWhat about I built a gun?What about my gravity cannon?
But in the most poke, I laugh at the skill tree that directly copys the dark tide. How can I even copy the halo of the humorous mosquito legs of the soldiers?However, the four thieves next door facing the tide of the corpse tide without injuries, the blood was full of blood, and the grenade was brushed, and the three original P brush waves and worms here were sweaty.The red -letter warrior on the face with the murderer team with the murderer sacred beetle terminator or even rolled directly into the eaves and turned into a marathon.Essence
Say a joke: ""Death is my skill"" (he really said this)
For a little bit, for this set of humorous skill trees and weapon development systems, we must make the first six pictures of the first shot of the liver.After the epic game experience of the Blood Crazy Tyrannosaurus King, I finally couldn't help laughing and became a fool.
As a game that wants to operate for a long time, the stacking is necessary, and some of his campaign stacking can be regarded as qualified, and the cooperation mode as the core of the game and the battle mode that has been given by the Wind Moon Film War Troupe,He is unqualified. At this stage, there are too little and too few. He only hopes that you should not pay tribute to the legendary operation in the long -term operation.

Finally, the Space Chaoxiong has also ushered in its own free upgrade. It is difficult to mention the difficulty. The enemy's strength and wave frequency are super enhanced. Special units are one by one.Lecart poke me?When I went to the seed of dazzling wolf cubs that year, can you be mixed with this half of the heart?What is even more terrible is that the desire to attack the brain bugs and the emulsion of the Changshu Mandarin, who played a group of Boolong plus female diol, even soared.
CSM is heavyweight. Seeing a wave of enemies on the screen, the next second corner of the enemy came out of the two sage beetle teriters plus a wizard and brushed three red -letter fighters behind this.Essence
In addition to the melee judgment of the cutting attack system, the distance and invincible time of the rolling tumbling and invincible time, the most inexplicable change is that his aiming and accuracy time of the poison cannon was randomized.Come to roll into a passionate look at the aiming line, and immediately lose half of the blood when you are crooked. The real restoration of the modern Sangirf is a crispy game experience that can only be raised to the dragon.
Even if it is, add a brotherhood system copied from the dark tide, and the fighting brothers must approach each other to return to the armor!And I turned over the 10th version of CODEX without seeing where I wrote that there were no fighting brothers around the super -warrior.As a jail, you see a group of weirds rushing towards you. If you can hold back and not jump up and smash the floor, you have already surpassed 90%of adolescent sports, and in this difficulty 5, you flew out by yourself alone.It means that you will become a waste that cannot be returned to armor.

If your teammates need to stand in the back row to get a shooting vision or avoid teammates from blocking the gunsIf you are in the battle, you will encounter the same problem, and the pioneer must make a choice every time I pick up the enemy: I jump out and cut off the swallowing gun and venom cannibal.The venom burst of the venom that keeps the front is randomly drawn?

Space Marine 2 has a great potential and may become extremely popular co-op game. It's extremely fun to play this game in co-op. My wife also liked this game, I was really happy to play SM2 with her.

Story is good, combat feels amazing, world (level design) looks really cool and impressive, co-op is awesome (I was playing in team of 2 friends), boss fights are kinda challenging and enjoyable, graphics and performance is really good for my GeForce GTX 1070 video card, I have no problems at all.

I am into warhammer for well over 20 years. I own basicly every 40k game there is from psp Squad Command to Chaos Gate for windows 95. I am an absolute Fanboi, there is no way to call it otherwise. I am a true nerd on that subject. Read the Books, watched the Films/Shows (Yes, the 80s VHS Movies and Warhammer+ Content). I own several Armies and collect the various army books since 2nd Edition.

With that out of the Way I can truly say, this game is a loveletter from the Developers to the Hardcore Fanbois. And I hereby and with my Purchase thank them for this absolutely Gorgeous game.

The 40k IP has been treated mixed. We had some great Games like Battlefleet Gothic, Dawn of War 1-2(not 3 though), some mediocre Stuff like Mechanicus (The OST is fire though), Rogue Trader and alot of Terrible Games. (Dawn of War 3, Storm of Vengance, The Mobile Games, Eternal War).

I am a Gamer for most of my life. Burnt my fingers on more Games I was exited about then I care to admit. I was very cautios with this one. I really hoped it would be atleast ""ok´ish"" and was very sceptical when I saw that ""Play 4 days Earlier for 40€"" nonsense. But boy, this game restored a bit of my Faith in the Gaming Industry.

Over the course of the last 10-15 years I watched a noticeable decline. For me, personaly, AAA was utter trash with a 60-80€ Price Tag. Indie Games where the stuff to go for and I havent Bought Anything from any ""Big Publisher"" for over 10 Years (Allright, with the exception of Anno 1800 and I regret that, but that does not belong here).

This Game is exactly what was modern Gaming was Missing. Its a Joyride, feature complete game on day 1. Not one of those games, and you know wich one I mean, wich turn into Games as a Service or thats actually ""Finished"" 2-3 Years AFTER release.

Hell, even if you´re not a total 40k nut like me, this game will blast you Away. The Story/Singleplayer Campaign is a 8-12 Hours long, 90s testoterone filled action Movie. Filled with a world to dive in, a world that engages you and makes you Forget your Job and all your Problems in Life. Its a Rollercoaster Ride you will remember in the Years to come.

The Game is full of Content. While most Publishers would´ve went the Lazy way and Recycle the Singleplayer for the Coop experience, this game offers a whole new set of Missions bound into the Story. That says alot. Ubisoft would´ve sold this as a several Game.

By the dark Gods, everytime I thought they hit the climax, they pushed it from 10/10 to 11/10 and in the End even to 12/10. I am glad Games like this still are made.

My Heretic heart jumps with Joy.

This game gets a Clear recommendation from me.

First of all I LOVE THIS GAME

BUTT

It has high highs and very low lows

----------WHAT I LOVE AND WOULD KISS THE DEVELOPERS FOR -------------------------------

1. World building ( I never knew what a battlebarge interior looked like and am trying to recreate one in another game so this helps a lot ) ( the little room of a marine )

2. Graphics

3. Space marine lines, interactions, roasts, voice actors - chefs kiss

4. The random interactions on the ship ( Relationship between serfs, marines, techpriests and servitors )
As a side-note, there was an interaction where a servitor reported severe spine injury and that did describe the horror of a servitor)

5. Gaunts dying from the psychic blast when a warrior dies is PERFECTION.

6. Marine movement, weapon sounds, all great

7. The way you can find random areas with weapons or dataslates.

8. Fisting flowers ( Imperial fist reference?)



----------What I hate, dislike, am confused about ( I may be wrong, I accept that, so feel free to discuss with me on this)

1. The armor colors on the customization menu are POOP. Mostly. A lot of colors are missing and some are completely different from the GW colors with the same name. Was it hard to sample bucket those colors from the GW website? AND WHY ARE THERE SO FEW?

2. The eliminator sniper seems way to weak compared to the tabletop

3. The pyroblaster flame looks terrible, range way to short

4. If a unit makes a special attack you cant react with a grenade or some other things, Titus stays there like a brain damaged guardsmen.

5. The way they made the tyrannid rippers is terrible. They are just floating 3D models that are not actually there like the rest of the units and for some reason are not affected by the psychic blast when a warrior dies.

6. The leman russes I saw never move their sponson weapons or USE THEM.

7. The game loads so slow I can take a nap in the meantime.

8. I had a heavy bolter with some rounds left, then I started fighting the LICTOR and I no longer had the weapon, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I was using that.

9. The cutscenes are premade and it does not matter what loadout you selected, it always shows one weapon. A BIT LAZY

10. The enemy variety seems poor, when you see how many units tyrannids actually have. Many of them could be bosses. ( I write this not having finished the game yet so I may eat my words later on)



----------What I wanted but did not get, maybe for now --------------------

1. Letting me play the campaign with custom colors and armor. LET ME PRETEND I AM FIGHTING WITH MY HOMEBREW ARMY. PLEASE!!!

2. Did not see a way to apply custom chapter badges ( homebrew reasons as well )


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- NEW REVIEW AFTER I FINISHED THE MAIN CAMPAIGN --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

WHAT I AM MOST DISAPPOINTED

1. The campaign is way too short, took me 2 days to finish

2. The tyrannid enemies and variety is VERY LACKING
WHAT YOU GET - Rippers, Gaunts, Warriors, Lictor, Carnifexes, spore mines, Harpy, Raveners, Zoanthropes

WHAT YOU DID NOT GET - Bio-Titans, Genestealer, Hive guards, Mawlock, Pyrovores or Biovores, Tervigones, Tyranofexes, Venomthropes

3. Sometimes the guard units just stop and wait for the player to move to the next area, like in poor designed games when the animation just finishes and nothing more happens ( more specifically the bridge section )

4. Random lore aspects that don't make sense like the tyrannids collecting corpses but there are no reclamation pools or tendrils OR having both first-born vehicle models and primaris models

5. Forcing me to use certain weapons in the latest boss battles, when I was saving some special weapons.

6. Like I said before, Leman Russ tanks not shooting their side weapons at all.

7 . The guardsmen depiction is kinda ♥♥♥♥ in regards to their equipment ( they never use mortars, heavy weapons, sentinels, hellhounds, special weapons AT ALL) ( NOT EVEN A BASILISK BOMBARDMENT )

8. No mission with a usable vehicle, just teases us ( at least implement one with an invictor suit )

9. Most of the game is filled with massive teases ( seeing a baneblade stationary BUT NEVER AFTERWARDS, NEVER IN COMBAT) ( a helldrake that suddenly becomes irrelevant )

10. The fact that I have to unlock colors that are WAY TO FEW and INNACURATE

11. The price of the game when you take into consideration all of its negative aspects


The whole game feels like a cash grab, but with some effort put into it because there are still many pozitive aspects.

If with the next patches they change some things I WILL CHANGE THE REVIEW.

I am just disappointed.",2024/9/8,en

sssddsdsd,0,18.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198217730923/,"In the Warhammer Series, this game is first seen and the story etc. are played without understanding the story.
Game system, especially reviews will be written around PVE mode.
* There is a little spoiler

General commentary
If you want to enjoy the series fans, the sense of presence and the world, those who are tired of the character that tends to be in recent shooters, or to lovers soul -based shooters.
I regret buying it because I think it's a hord shooter and I don't recommend it.At least it didn't suit me.
He had the impression that he had forced the horn shooter, the soul, and the hunt, but as a horn shooter, the upper enemy was too hard and there were too many small fish enemies for soul and hunt.

What I think is good
1: You can customize the armor quite well (the character itself is fixed with a unusual uncle who plays the role, but it is good)
2: A sense of presence from the solid world view
3: A refreshing finisher can be fired repeatedly

What I thought it didn't suit me
Overall game
1: If you make it a head -like soul -like that seemed to be a horn shooter, you will be able to do it immediately
2: The movement is light (I think it has a solid feeling to some extent, but a little too much, stress on a large crowd)
3: There is no gap between the top enemies from inside, and if it is a 1vs hunter like a game that hunts a certain monster, it may be fine, but there is a large amount of small fish enemies and long -range attacks from all sides.Title
4: This gun is just a bean gun, but the enemy flies and flies to the sky, which is simply boring.
5: There are few weapons that are suitable for the horde, and there are some things that can strengthen the penetration of bullets by doing their best and raising their levels, but I didn't think I would do that.
6: At the time of writing this review, I feel that the armor is too nervous and the means of recovering physical strength is too limited, so I personally like games that can be enjoyed more easily, so I didn't fit me.

Terminid
1: The upper enemy is too hard and the power of this gun is delicate and there is no exhilaration, feeling like shooting a sponge.
2: The upper enemy floats has no gap, has a lot of physical strength, has a lot of barrier, and shoots a long -range attack.
3: The lower enemies fall on their own if they defeat all the middle enemies around them, but the most important middle enemies appear in Barrett sponge and quite a group.

chaos
1: Even if the middle enemy is stiff and shoots with a gun, it runs away by teleport even if you hit it, and the enemy shoots infinitely from all sides.To be clear, shit
2: There is a shield in the lower enemies, and it often springs up in a considerable number of people.Fucking
3: The high -end humanoid long -range type does not flicker, and it is infinite high -heat.Fucking
4: I don't like the color.Fucking
5: Chaos shit",2024/9/16,ja
Legendz-Senpai⚜,1,71.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Legendz_Senpai/,"I can confirm that Space Marine 2 is probably the best game in the Warhammer 40k universe ever released so far, especially in 3-player co-op, it's enjoyable and awesome.
the game is really beautiful graphically, the scenario is solid and respects the universe of warhammer 40k very well if you like the universe you will really be served. There is a pretty crazy attention to detail in the game the number of enemies that are displayed by combat is really impressive the same for the enemy and allied units in the distance that you can kill there are many different ways to play the game even if in the end it remains the same thing you have a lot of weapons in melee and at a distance. The animations are so enjoyable the cinematics are really magnificent worthy of a movie. The modus operandi is really nice and allows you to play with your own squad at the same time as the main missions of the campaign (always with 3) which allows you to explore the actions during the campaign a little more. And if you are interested in multiplayer for the moment it is really very nice worthy of the first opus of space marine and the future content that the studio plans to put really gives me good hope (new pve mission, pvp mod, horde mode, new weapons etc ...) In short to be honest I never buy games in advance and even less at 80 € to play them in advance but I must say that I am so impressed by the qualities of the game that I recommend you to play it even if you are not a hardcore fan of warhammer. Many studios should perhaps take Saber Interactive as an example to take time to refine their game (isn't that right ubisoft) then just imagine a real single player game as refined as space marine 2 in the star wars universe. I 100% recommend the game.",2024/9/7,en

Both there and there, the super -soldiers of the future exterminate giant beetles from distant space, but Sony again confirmed the title of ""offices"", so today I write only todayAbout Space Marine 2 as a game of the year.

The game is old -fashioned.It is made according to the formula from the zero: each self -respecting blockbuster should have a ten hour campaign, multiplayer and cooperative.But precisely because now they do not make such games, it is felt by a sip of fresh air.I also did not even have problems with bugs and the technical condition at the start.

It disappears from my head immediately after passing, but I remember exactly that it passed it literally with an open mouth.This is the most reliable Warhammer at the moment.Familiar from the books of the construction of a planetary scale and countless hordes of enemies are here and they are made with the maximum scale and details.Therefore, my space marineer for a long time did not run towards the goals of the missions, but painstakingly studied every meter of hives.

It was clearly not created as the main mode.But like the old parts of Call of Duty allows you to just have fun to run and shoot.Short matches, small cards, instant revival, funny phrases, rewards for each action.The old kind classic of the times of games in Jewel for a hundred.

Make a sweat.The path to the maximum level is a heavy rise to the top.You get in the face, rise, raise the levels of weapons and class, learn to play and begin to feel more confident at this level of difficulty.Then you go to the next level and ... already at the very beginning of the mission, the game puts you in place.You are nobody again, go learn to play.Sooner or later, you get to the last, fifth level of complexity, which will become a complicated test of your skills.Maybe you will not master it, but by that time at least you are pumping weapons and skills.
And then it turns out that you pumped only one class and one set of weapons.All the others need to download in the same way from scratch.And in the game only 6 (after updating 7) missions.You need to go through time after time.Do you know what madness is?This mode is too slow progression.

In general, I recommend trying Space Marine 2 even to those who are not a fan of the Warhammer 40 000 universe. It is beautiful, unusual, challenges and rewards for overcoming it.In addition, this is a game from ""our"" developers.These come out infrequently, but always delight.If this is not a turmoil, lol (but it is difficult to call it a game).

The rest of the game is very positive.The combat system makes you want every time and even the imperator would be proud of the graphic because it even runs very smoothly.Interface and audio look very well revised and the German Syncro can be heard from.In my opinion, the absolute highlight is the campaign.I can not criticize absolutely anything because it is a lot of fun and the staging is more than successful.

The design of course fucks, but it was very upset that it was the heresy of Trizch who appears in the game in the universe again.At the end of last year, the magnificent Rogue Trader was already released, in which Tsinchu’s demons were also mostly in the main story.I would like to watch in large games at other chaos.

In general, I am sure that these developers will still fill the game with many content.And if the game is interesting to people, they will support it for several years.But at the exit for the game for 5k wooden, well, too weak and empty.The same Rogue Trader on the release, although he had many bugs and strong distortions in the balance, but content in it was 100+ hours.Yes, and it cost much cheaper.The long -range weapon is all the same in sensations, to use something other than heavy bolts and milly in general.Types of opponents are also extremely few - 5 for tyranids and 4 for chaosites.There are few missions, the tasks on the missions are reduced to pressing the buttons on the terminals.

It also seemed that the soundtrack was not enough for the game.I did not remember a single track playing against the background.As if they specially tried to write music, which would be slightly and as unobtrusive as possible in the ear at the time of dashes for locations.But this is Waha, there should be epic orchestral compositions.As it was in the same Rogue Trader, by the way.

I did not encounter technical problems at all, once only from 20-30 sessions in the operations caught a disconnect, but it was more like a local network problem.

If you think to buy, but in doubt - it is better to wait six months or a year.Then maybe the content will be delivered, and the discounts are drunk.Only completely broken fans of the universe will be able to entertain themselves on a release.

In short, I don’t understand why so many Space Marine 2 are called one of the best games in the universe at the moment.

DanWardog,1,141.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994343052/,"The style of the game is on point with satisfying gameplay, but it has some GLARING issues. I'd recommend it, but I hope it gets some polish soon!

Pros:
Style: The feel of the 40k universe is really hit on the head. This alone has probably gotten me through the game. I just really adore it.
Audio: Crunchy sound design is very satisfying.
Weapons: The gear you use feels pretty good, the design is limited, but it's loyal to the universe.
Gameplay: Fairly rhythmic fighting with parries, counters & dodges.
Big enemies: Boss fights can be tough ( Angel of Death difficulty ), but typically manageable ( caveat below ).
Story: The story is a bit shallow, but good enough.

Cons:
The most glaring issue is ally AI. It's horrendous, pathetically bad. This can make some boss fights an absolute slog when you're trying to balance yourself to proceed through the fight. It also destroys immersion seeing an Astartes knuckle f***ing himself in the corner while you're fighting for your life.
Hit boxes: The hit boxes are bad. You'll get hit at bizarre ranges & you'll often shoot invisible walls when attacking enemies. I've also been struck countless times through cover from ranged attacks.
Homing Melee Attacks: One the most annoying things in this game is enemies leaping at you ( not talking about parry counters ) & having them turn in the air or have them YA YEET themselves after you when you dodge.
Stun Lock: Though I understand it's a swarm hitting you & that's sort of the point, getting stun locked is just a poor choice. No one likes stun lock. No one likes losing control of their character. No one wants to have 2/3 of their health gone from 3 gaunts.

Edit:

Tacked on Feature: After finally playing the PvP I gotta' say it's pretty dog-sh*t. The fact that you have to re-level up just to use weapons is a very brain-dead decision. It's artificial play time that should not exist in a game where PvP feels like a tack-on to begin with. Being dumped into games where the majority of my team is > Level 10 & the opponents are < Level 20 is laughable. Less options, less-powerful gear ( in some aspects ) & less experience vs a team higher in all regards. Trashy.",2024/9/10,en

Pros:

Excellent graphics and design, people working on the environment, weapons and armor are great fellows, Ehe

Good animations of weapons of near and long -range combat, characters and bosses (especially in the campaign).

The story campaign was OK, but the general tonality of what was happening was not felt seriously or gloomy.

The coop is good, everything except the bad balance pleases me.Especially pleased with the recently added 7 mission.

PVP did not touch, but its presence as additional content is also pleasing.

Cons:

Deadly balance of complexity - we will simply make mobs 400% fatter.
The overwhelming part of the long -range weapons shoots with peas, regardless of the level of rarity.A person who decided that boltgars should apply scanty damage, have a huge scatter and still throw limited ammunition on top - are you normal?The damage of near-fighting weapons on elite enemies also raises questions, although 10 strokes (not a mini-boss) are not as annoyed by the enemy as 30 shots to the head to a state of finishing, which very much harms the sensation of shooting.

The terrible mixing of sound - the sounds themselves are not bad, but due to mixing in them there is no impact and ""juiciness"".

Slothing soundtrack, which is inferior even to the first part.This is especially true for music during the battle, when some kind of baking or hammer blows, fixed 10 times.The title theme is just a generic without charisma, who is not terrible, but is also forgotten immediately after pressing the “start the game”.Embent on the battle barge ""OK"", but no more.

I want to like this game, but I can't recommend it when the first game is better in every way. Saber Interactive clearly has some big fans of the franchise in their midst, but the gameplay needs a lot more time in the oven.

Visually, the game is stunning. If you're a lore enjoyer, you're in for a good time.

The gameplay is passable to bad in the best of times. They attempt to wow you with some cool swarming tech, but once the novelty wears off, you're left with a lot to be desired.

Gunplay is bland and simple while Melee is clunky and unpolished. Hitting enemies feels like hitting a sponge. Dodge and Parry prompts aren't responsive and sometimes simply wont do anything at all. You'll take 3/4 of your health in damage for failing a prompt. Better hope someone on your team is killing the ranged enemies or that failed prompt will end with you dying while your character tries to stand up.

When an enemy's health gets low enough, they're stunned and prompt you to run over and Execute them with a special animation. When executed, you'll restore armor (not health). This would be great if smaller enemies didn't die in one hit, preventing you from executing them for armor. Don't forget that you're getting hit for a majority of your health, so, good luck! Sometimes it feels like it's is more efficient to recover health/armor by dying and letting your AI companions resurrect you.

It is even not as good as dark.
There are a few very big questions, I hope you know before the 9th tour.
1. The guns cannot be interrupted instructions, and they are not completely invincible. Under the difficulty of difficulty, the high blood elite cannot be directly taken off, so I still recommend melee execution.
2. There are bugs in some maps. The wizards that have not been killed in the last scene (last stage) will resurrect the thousands across the map, resulting in the game that is almost impossible.
3. There are two sections of the block, and the second paragraph is a push, but the push is not blocked, and the resistance of the blocking itself is not strong, and the situation of the mixed tide or plural elite cannot be supported.
4. Instructions In addition to being executed and blocking interruption, the rolling roll cannot be interrupted, which means that you must end the last action if you want to roll.As a result, the weapon with a large action frame like Thunder Hammer suffers.
5. There is no nanny at present in this game. The battle returns to the battle is relatively strict. There are three cases. One is that the shield will be opened next to you.Execute immediately.So the full shield should be given to the teammates to the teammates.
6. High difficulty remote survivability is insufficient, and it is difficult to balance the surrounding and miscellaneous and handled elites.At present, both the two mains have problems, which are mainly reflected in the treatment of the elites too slowly, and it is difficult to deal with Licat and snake worms without teammates.
7. In terms of mechanism, the role of the shield is actually connected. There are shield-clear mixed/injury-no shield-execution cycle to maintain the battle rhythm, but once it is stuck to the shield for a minute by remote melee.

Specifically, the latest mechanic that requires your character to be in close proximity to your teammates in order to both regenerate armor (after ~25s of taking no damage) or regain armor through combat (parries/gun strikes/executions), absolutely needs to be adjusted or removed entirely.

This mechanic is currently broken (or at least I hope it is not intended to be this way) when you are the last survivor in your squad. The game does not allow you to regenerate armor, PERIOD. Good luck trying to survive an enemy wave on Lethal difficulty for 300s as you wait for team to re-spawn. It should be turned off when you are the sole survivor.

I swear the distance required to be considered within range of your squad is shorter than the distance I can throw a Melta Bomb. It also seems like the 25s armor regeneration timer resets if you happen to step out of that range. This can cause you to be without armor for what seems like minutes at a time, even if there is no enemies around. You can only pray your brothers don't just run off while your back is turned to them because you're Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palming a massive Tyranid wave trying to survive.

Stefan_Melchiott,1,81.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolf_Ratnik/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - naturally, one of the best games of 2024.
It is worth noting right away that I am not an ardent fan, played literally in a couple of games in the universe, once tried to figure it out in a hunger strike, but threw it.First of all, I became interested in the project, like aa-game from my fellow countrymen.
Space Marine 2 passed in the solo, initially there were plans to play with friends, but it did not grow together and immediately note that playing without a cooperative is not difficult even on high difficulties, so if someone tells you about the need to play with a company of friends, this is not necessary.
It is also important to note the most excellent optimization (against the background of other titles of 24 years, the game looks great, but at the same time requires much less resources).
The plot covers the continuation of the story of the Titus ultramarine, who returned from the guard of death and set about new tasks (I advise you to go through the first part in order to completely immerse himself in the game).And then we simply follow the instructions of the command, carry out tasks and as a result of the past of our hero is mixed with the present, which is built in a new epic history.
The gameplain game is ochering, a combat system is very balanced, where it is necessary to use not only firearms, but also with cold weapons.The game makes you always be at the middle distance, not to go far from the enemy, but not to break into the Epic itself.There are many missions that bring a completely new experience, some interesting mechanics.
In addition to the plot missions, there are additional tasks that cover the events, which occurred against the background in the main plot.There is already pumping, different classes, which adds interest to the game.In the future, developers promise to add more and more new missions.
The multiplayer is excellent, for once, we do not need to endlessly download some guns, knock out some ranks.The network game simply gives funny emotions, which has long been missing in modern games.

I definitely advise the game of both solo and team players, you will have fun.

Plot
The plot is very simple, I won’t spoil it, but it has come to me, it intersects closely with the plot of the first part (which I did not play, but I will definitely play) that I can say about the plot at all - it will be a bit of the type of “this evil one must kill, and this subject should be killed, and this subjectIt is necessary to break "", but even so the game can surprise with sharp turns, and in some places you do not expect what will happen next, in general the plot is normal, I put Boltgana 7 out of 10
Gameplay
Gameplay is an ordinary robilovo, but what, but the blood is chew, different sutures and animations are also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyway, there is a parry, a bias and some kind of shot and the most high is a finishing ... here is finishing up as inDuma is the same bloody and high, different finishing on all kinds of enemies from the small beetle of tyranid to fuck ... And then you will see who you can finish, the blood is 10/10 of it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anywayI like it.I put 9 VAAAGX of 10 for gemplepley.
Graphics without questions - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as if you are watching a movie, facial expressions, armor quality, card details and everything that is on the map looks gasped.About the atmosphere of the map and the game itself also rolls over, in some moments goosebumps go on the skin, so it is Ahuenna.
In general, I put 10 chain swords out of 10
He is the main character as thought out as much as possible, his character, his speech is simply Ahuenna, when you play for him, you feel like a real lieutenant of the Ultramarin company.
Captain, Capellan and Kalgar - all of them are also made cool and thoughtfully, each of them has different relationships to the GG, for example, the chaplain does not particularly trust the main character and says that he will always follow him, the captain loves GG (not in the sense)He trusts him and gives out difficult tasks, and Kalgar simply loves GG, he trusts him greatly and believes in him
Minor characters - two secondary characters who pass the company with us, they are also made very well, each of them has its own character and dialect, each of them belongs to heretics, tyranids and GG are different, there are moments in which I was very worried about them
Characters in the form of classes - I played only for two of course, but then I will definitely play for others.
The class ""support"" is silent and strict, communicates only with military phrases and words, to kill the buzz for it, a heavy bolter makes a rattatata and now the enemy exploded the head
The class ""Sturmovik"" is also silent, but less strict, to kill a separate buzz for it, he just hates heretics and xenos, and therefore screams how he does not like them much
In general, I put 8 chaplains out of 10 for characters
In general, I am sure that this game of the year, if not - the emperor’s sword in the ass, the game absolutely deservedly received so many positive reviews.

Zacirus,0,86.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zacirus/,"Pre patch 3, this game would have been one of my highest recommended Warhammer 40K games ever made.

Now? Probably not.

Gameplay loop and game feel were fantastic PRE Patch 3, some balancing was off, but overall it was hectic fun challenge on Ruthless/Angel of Death (Difficulty 4) and it felt like an earned victory when you and your buddies pulled it off.

Post Patch 3, there are practically no enemy hordes throughout each Operations level, certainly none that are overwhelming. There are tiny little groups of enemies that pose no real threat scattered distantly from each other so you have plenty of time to to kill the five or six enemies on screen and then run for 2-3 minutes taking in the sights with nothing to do to the next tiny group of enemies, any big bad type enemies spawn in basically solo, so you can easily focus them with no pressure and destroy them in seconds. Can now easily Duo every Operations on Difficulty 4 and grind with no real challenge, but why would I? It's dull to play currently and more prone to crashing.

The campaign was a fantastic, and focused fight for your life on launch and the story beats are still wonderful, loved seeing Titus make his return. Played on Angel of Death the first time through with a buddy and it took us about 10-12 hours. It was a really fun overcoming the odds by being a good team and covering each other. Not anymore.

Currently I could replay the campaign post Patch 3 on Angel of Death and solo it without resistance. That's not fun or a challenge. Why even have different difficulties at this point if they're all easy mode.

I will gladly change my review if they fix the spawn rates, fix the constant crashing and make this fun to play again.",2024/9/27,en

When I tried to access the PVE and PVP multiplayer modes, the game crashed constantly after a few minutes from the start of a game.I was not the only one to face this problem: many other users reported similar situations, which made frustration even bigger.I had tried several solutions, but without success, and I found myself forced to negatively evaluate a game which, despite its visual quality and its potential, was unjustable for a significant part of the experience.

Fortunately, with the last update, everything has changed.The developers finally resolved the bug that caused the crash in multiplayer modes, and now I can say that Space Marine 2 has returned to being a title that really deserves.The PVE and PVP modes work perfectly, and I can finally enjoy the entire game package without problems.",2024/9/21,it

Starting with the good/okay aspects.

The atmosphere in this game is truly incredible, you feel completely immersed in the 41st millennium and the sound design and animations are gorgeous.

The campaign is a solid 6.5/10 it is quite literally, just the first games story, rehashed slightly, complete with fun and interesting enemy, who you get to fight for too short of an amount of time, before the tedious and boring one. It fulfilled the power fantasy and was a compelling enough story that once it kicked off I wanted to see it through as quickly as possible.

The PVE Operations are the strength of this game by far, it is a lot of fun playing with two friends and earning gear and unlocking perks. I look forward to seeing how they expand on it.

Now for my issues with the game.

Customization is hidden behind a grind, which is fine, progression isn't inherently bad, however, the way you unlock emblems and color palettes feels needlessly convoluted, they can only be unlocked in a specific order once you pick a faction and the currency used to unlock things is shared with the PVE game mode perks, and the weapon skins making it a bit grindy. These customization options are really cool! But don't think you can place that particular Iron Warriors Skull on your RIGHT pauldron, I am afraid that one is restricted to the LEFT pauldron only. That really cool metallic you found that would be perfect for your chapter's main color? Sorry, that is a tertiary color only, it can be used for trim and nothing else.
Speaking of traitor marines, the customization for them is basically non existent (On a side note, after customizing my marine, I have played 12 straight games of Chaos where I can't see it, which is hilarious).

PvP is okay, but it feels more like a demo for the game mode that has yet to be released. There are only 3 maps, and 3 game modes. The classes all feel well made and overall balanced. Close combat however feels like it has the depth of a puddle, it is generally whoever lands the first attack wins. Parrying does nothing but block damage, there is no stagger, no window for you to attack back, your opponent can just keep flailing away and you must hope a teammate comes to your rescue. I think utilizing the very fun parry system in the campaign would've been a slam dunk and added depth. I mostly play sniper so this isn't hugely impactful for me, but still.

I could go on more, but honestly this game feels more like a demo than a full release, which is crazy to say after a decade of waiting. I will continue to play here and there with friends because I love the universe, but if this game was anything other than 40k I would not be playing it at all.",2024/9/21,en
Spidson,1,40.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/spidson/,"+I WILL BE USING THIS MORTAL VESSEL TO PASS MY JUDGMENT+

+It is with a gaze that has witnessed a million battles, a gaze that sees far beyond the limits of mortal comprehension, that I have deigned to examine this creation worthy of your time. And though the centuries have weathered countless conflicts, none have dimmed the fires of my eternal judgment. Hear me now, for my word is as binding as the stars themselves.+

+This... recreation of warfare seeks to glorify the deeds of the Adeptus Astartes, the finest of my creations, who carry my will into the void. In this, it is an admirable representation, capturing the brutal reality of battle with an unflinching hand. You, the player, are placed into the power-armored boots of a Space Marine, a once Captain of the Ultramarines, no less. Titus, once a hero of legend, returns to unleash righteous fury against the xenos filth that dare threaten the Imperium.+

+The graphics, like the eternal architecture of Terra itself, are grand and imposing, crafting a galaxy teeming with life and war. You will witness the burning skies, the shattered ruins of planets, and the never-ending tides of the enemy with such clarity that you might forget, for a brief moment, the fragility of your own existence. The immersion is total; you are the embodiment of my wrath, and for that, I commend the creators.+

+But let it not be said that my judgment is blind to faults. The enemies, while numerous and suitably grotesque, are repetitive in their design, much like the countless masses of orks and tyranids I have destroyed over millennia. Their minds are as predictable as the winds of Cadia before its fall. And though the combat is fierce and satisfying, there is a rhythm to it that one may find tiresome after enough time. Yet I understand the limitations of mortal creativity, and I am forgiving.+

+Where the game shines, however, is in the portrayal of the Adeptus Astartes. Each blow, each strike feels heavy with the weight of a thousand years of warfare, and each step resounds with the thundering presence of an unstoppable force. You are no mere man in this world, but a demigod among men, and the gameplay reflects that truth in glorious fashion.+

+The story, though not as intricate as the weave of fate I have spun for humanity, serves its purpose. It is a tale of defiance in the face of oblivion, a tale the galaxy knows all too well. Titus stands, as all Space Marines must, as the last bulwark against annihilation. Though his struggles are but a fragment of the grand narrative, they are a necessary reminder of the eternal struggle against darkness.+",2024/9/20,en

Metuz,1,87.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vinceh/,"As of writing this review I have never been more torn on whether to recommend a game or not.

The campaign has moments which will make Warhammer fans giddy like a kid at Christmas, especially on the last two missions (if you've played it you know.) Even non Warhammer fans will have a good time with this. The voice acting, graphics and audio are all strong.
However, it's criminally short. Took me about 5.5 hours to complete and I died...a lot.

The AI in this game is something out of 2004. Squad mates will watch you getting annihilated and not budge an inch, or decide to stand in front of you as you attempt to lay waste to heretics. It's infuriating, and something you'll need to get used to because the online matchmaking in SM2 is straight up cheeks. I hope you enjoy restarting your game a lot, and loading screens, because you'll become familiar with both.

Bugs, crashes, loooong loading times, and infinite loading times are going to likely infest your experience worse than any Tyranid could, and this after the game was already pushed back a considerable amount of time.

The core game play of SM2 is really solid. Any third person shooter fans, especially those that enjoyed Gears of War are going to have a great time. It's challenging, brutal and unapologetic in it's approach. It knows it's target audience and swings for the fences, and most of the time it connects.

This game will live or die in the next 3-6 months on how much the Dev will support it.
Fixing the myriad of tech issues, and bringing more content to coop and multiplayer. More maps are needed, it's a non-negotiable.

SM2 is a real mixed bag. A frustrating, disappointing mixed bag all within a room filled with potential. This could be something truly special but it's not there...yet.

I'm going to reluctantly recommend it purely because I'm a Warhammer fan, and there are moments in this game that are perfection, but as a non Warhammer fan wait for a sale. By that time you'll have a feel for how many of the issues have been fixed, and what the landscape is looking like with more content to make it worthwhile.",2024/9/17,en
Die Happy,1,129.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/die_happy/,"So 80 Hours in this game features 3 distinct parts.


TLDR: game looks and sounds great, very true to source material

campaign story is decent but nothing to write home about. great spectical but obviously parts were cut from it. maybe not enough time, still good fun, specially in coop.

PVE mode 3 player coop in style of darktide, L4F etc, has a lot of meat to sink your teeth into, customisation, leveling etc.

PVP more 6vs6 with 3 game modes and 3 maps. fun but lacking a lot of content and is a 2010 style shooter.

BUY if you like the PVE or PVP campaign is not worth the full price

LONG VERSION

outside of PVP the gameplay is a 3rd person shooter where you can often run out of ammo but that where melee comes in. this has a whole melee system with attack combos, blocking parrying, doging in it. kind of like the lastes god of war games. if you take damage you lose armor which regenerates after 30 seconds or you can execute enemies to get some back. when out or armor you loose health which you can get back by doing damage a short time after taking it. like in bloodbourne. if you miss that short mindow there are me packs that restore some health and some classes can get health back r hel other with it.

so now you run around and 20 small enemies + a handfull elites leading them show up. you shoot and melee the hell out of them taking damage, regenerating armour by executing which also give you i-frames. blocking, doging parrying etc. with enough pratice it becomes a dance of death. which can be really fun when you get into ""the flowstate"" of the combat.

a single player campaign:
playable with up to 3 players in coop. this is the main story. features no progression or leveling or armor customisation. the story is and plot is ok. nothing fancy but servicable. in terms of looks and sound its great though. bombastic and warhammer as hell. depending on your difficulty you will play this for about 8-10 hours. good for one playthough but thats it. there are a lot of shooters that deliver a better story. but the spectacle is here.

adjacent to the campaign is the operations mode:

you play 3 marines can choose from 6 diffent classes featuring unique skills and skill trees ofthen even unique weapons. you play 3 player coop missions kind of like darktide, left 4 dead etc. with a director that keeps thing fresh and sets up enemy spawns etc.

this mode features full leveling of weapons and classes with skill trees with 4 difficulty levels. this is where i spend 90% of my playtime. leveling different classes and their weapons earning ingame currency to buy their gear and customize their armor look from the 9 loyalist legions + a plethora of 1st and second founding astartes chapters. armor visual customization looks really good. in this mode i have arnound 60-70 hours and have maxed 4 of the 6 classes but often just a handfull of their available weapons.


next is the 6vs6 pvp modes, it is disconnected from the other modes in terms of progression and although you have the same classes some skills are slightly different and you only unlock weapon loadouts & cosmetics. there are no skilltrees or weapon skill trees. you also earn ingamemoney you can use in the operations mode to unlock new cosmetics and weapons.

you play loyalist vs traitors while for loyalist you can customize way the traitors models are locked in in terms of model but you can customize colors & emblems. so for example the vanguard is always a world eater, the heavy always death guard. but you can color them differently.

3 game modes, deathmatch, domination and capture and hold. on only 3 maps.
the game modes are fine, the maps are fine but it is all very COD 2010. spawncamping can easily happen. matchmaking isnt great. the melee system is gutted compared to pve modes, you can parry and block but besides negating damage but you dont get an advantage for it over the enemy. thoug melee ignores armor. besides that you regenerate armor faster than in pve and even heal quite fast.
it is fun but has its problems lacking content and using dated mechanics.

still very fun game and if you play the PVE coop mode or enjoy the PVP you can get a lot of hours out of it.
if you are only here for the campaign. better way for a sale.",2024/9/16,en

This latest installment in the Warhammer 40K universe sets a new standard for action-packed shooters with its impeccable blend of brutal melee combat, strategic gunplay, and stunning visuals. Saber Interactive really came through with this installment. It is a game that long time fans of Warhammer 40k truly have been asking for.

From the moment you step into the power armor of a Space Marine, the game impresses with its attention to detail. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking paired with a bombastic audio design, Space Marine 2 showcases the grimdark universe with a level of realism that immerses you completely. The environments are richly detailed, from the war-torn landscapes to the imposing architecture of the Imperium’s strongholds.

The combat is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The gameplay feels both fluid and weighty, with a seamless transition between hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry. The abilities and upgrades add depth and variety, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and exhilarating. The game’s AI is notably sharp, presenting a formidable challenge that keeps you on your toes without ever feeling unfair.

Narratively, the game excels in delivering a compelling story set against the backdrop of a galaxy in turmoil. The voice acting and script are top-notch, with a storyline that feels both epic and personal. The character development is rich, and the dialogue manages to balance gravitas with moments of dark humor, adding layers to the experience.

Multiplayer has a offering of diverse modes and a progression system that keeps the action engaging and competitive. Whether you’re battling in co-op missions or competing in PvP, the multiplayer experience is both rewarding and addictive. Looking forward to see what Saber Interactive does with future content.

In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a masterclass in combining thrilling gameplay with a deep, immersive world.

Craftless Rogue,1,12.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Revendawn/,"My Dearest Martha,

I write this letter having been beset by Tyranid scum and Chaos villainy. I have finished the main campaign with my AI brothers and there is much to say.

They say war is hell and while that is true here it is a very pretty hell. The sights and sounds of battle are massive in scale and in quality. Watching enemies explode into bloody bits or some magical dust ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was always satisfying. While most of my time was spent with two other squad mates there was always a feeling of a larger campaign at play. Sometimes from background battles raging, but also in those moments when you are charging forward alongside a massive army.

The spectacle is really incredible and I found, in general, the combat to be fun. Guns felt like that had impact and ""oomph"" melee weapons had weight. It felt good to run around, see the sights, and fight. All the pieces make for an extremely compelling experience that I couldn't walk away from, even if occasional issues would cause the odd rage-quit.

So let's talk about the bad stuff, because this has not been all roses. For every time you get a jump pack and the game gets 100x more fun there are a few things and missions that bring the overall experience down.

First off - this game is clearly a multiplayer/COOP game first. The AI squad is awful. They get the most important part right, which is trying to revive you if you go down, but beyond that they are poor in combat, and almost non-existent when it comes to objectives or tactics. Now it's okay to make a game where you want COOP as a focus, but if you are going to advertise and push that it's a solo game too you do need to properly support that experience and I think the game falls incredibly short in this key area.

In fact I think that if you had a better, more effective, and/or commandable squad the other issues I have might not matter. I also felt that for a giant armored Space Marine I felt like dolled up tissue paper. The game asks a lot in terms of special blocks, regular blocks, special dodges, regular dodges, pistol counters, executions, ranged fighting, and melee swarms all at once, but gives very little health and armor to support all of that even on the baseline difficulties. It doesn't make the game impossible by any means, but it does make it a little less fun.

Still I can't help but think that much of this is less of an issue if my squad was doing a better job of not making me fight everything mostly alone possibly while juggling objectives and in one really bad stage while also using a flamethrower to keep swarms at bay.

While I've focused on issues a bit I think overall my net experience with the game is far more better moments than troubled ones. There was only one stage I hated (the swarm bunker thing) and a few objectives that made me long for less brain-dead brothers at my side. It didn't prevent me from completing the campaign over a few days because I couldn't stop playing. They are also all issues that can be fixed.

So often we see games come out with problems way beyond the scope of a patch, but in the case of Space Marine 2 I don't think there is anything that couldn't be improved down the line. Hopefully they actually make some of these improvements, because I think this game could be damn-near perfect if they did.

Also as these issues are almost all tied to the single player experience, if you are playing online or with friends I think realistically you are just going to have a much better time. So it's an easy recommend to online/COOP players and while I still recommend it to solo player I do warn that there are some pain points, especially on higher difficulties from your AI companions.

At a time where my gaming has been an hour here, an hour there, try this, try that, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 became my world for a few days. Despite the blood and carnage of it all it was a glorious focus and a stellar time.

For the Emperor,

Alexai26,1,45.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198311354476/,"To start we would have to divide in two parts, one for normal people and another for W40K fans, I think it would be the best way to describe what this game is.

For normal people, the game looks very well graphically, the worst are the characters, who look good, but it does not reach the phostorealism of the stages, in terms of performance, I am not playing everything up/ultra less the textures, because it asks me for more than 8 GB of video RAM to use texture in ultra.I have used DLSS and I get an average of frames over 60 to 2K, which seems very well optimized, and does not usually fall when they carry hundreds of enemies on screen.I find this game with World War Z, in terms of mechanics and difficulty, for me it is not an easy game, just like WWZ you need to improve your team a lot to survive the waves, but just left and everythingThis will be subject to changes.In a good game, to relax a few hours a day, massacring enemies brutally, but if you want to be hooked for many hours, in my case I get tired of me, that is, perfect to play a few hours a day, but from 2 or 3hours, it can be heavy that day, but the next day you enjoy it again as a child.Despite the campaign, and the PVE game modes are necessaryThey will continue to take new content, but today, for me, I see it scarce, the game consists of repeating and repeating until you get the best scores, times and with the greatest difficulty.

For Warhammer fans, with all customization options as a scheme of colors, ornaments, badges, you will spend hours designing your favorite space sailor, your own chapter and even if you throw your own character imagination.And in photo mode, it is as if you had its Warhammer table game on your screen, the whole atmosphere takes you to the mad and dystopian future of W40K.

In summary, the game is fun, the extra cosmetic content I only see it necessary if you are a fan of the W40K and you can afford the fuck that is worth every nonsense.For a person who does not know W40K, it may seem expensive or little content, and that there are other better games, for tastes, I just hope I have helped you with this review.Of all motorcycles if you are not sure, wait for the demo or see gameplay videos on YouTube or streaming, now one thing, the video codec does not do justice to how the game is seen on your screen.

Note: The game uses servers for progress and multiplayer modes, but according to Roadmap, you can create a private and offline server, and you should upload experience, or at least in offline mode as WWZ occurs (this is in the air, we will see to seeAs they do at the end), you can play perfectly without internet connection in disconnected mode, or simply without internet connection.The only thing you do not advance in experience to your characters, therefore you do not unlock, improvements, cosmetics, etc,

As a clarification in WWZ, which has two modes the online that has its own level of progress, and the offline, that is, if I play online, and I carry at level 10, in the offline I follow at level 0 or vice versa.I like it that way because I always do not want to play with unknown people, and I simply fancy macharcar tyrannates to my ball quietly without the subnormal on duty being shooting me to run (this is already true, and yes, there is a friend fire).",2024/9/7,es

I've been into this world since i was 8 years old (i'm 28 now), i have read a LOT of Warhammer fiction and i can assure you that this game perfectly depicts what an Astartes looks like and what is he capable of.
Saber nailed it: the setting is perfectly captured in all possible ways, the lore respected and made alive and the gameplay is just fantastic.
It was the game i was expecting since i've finished Space Marine 13 years ago and i'm playing it with the same friends (i mean BATTLE BRATHAS) i used to play SM1 and actual Warhammer tabletop games back in the days.
I cannot recommend this game enough.

I'm playing with an RTX 3070 for laptop with medium/high settings and the game runs smoothly, i've not experienced freezes so far even when my screen was swarmed by filthy xenos.

While having some fundamental changes to the mechanics, the core is still there - and the additions / changes don't remove anything; in fact it contributes to the power fantasy. With practice and dedication - and some nice Relic weapons, you can wade through Lethal like it's your first time doing Substantial.

The graphics are awesome, attention to lore is fantastic, and the overall feel of the game gives you a level of immersion I haven't had in ages. Some mentioned this is a reminder of what we've lost, but look at what's been found.

And consecrated by the gaming community!

Relic's done a pretty decent job so far handling the community, and their responsiveness and willingness to engage is a great predictor for the future of this game.

I have high hopes that I'll be fisting the enemies of the Imperium for years to come.

Speaking is that the role of the character is extremely poor, the blood bars cannot be returned, the medical package is limited, the blood backbone skills need to kill the enemy, the white shield is crispy as paper, and it will be dropped by it.Although the execution has become invincible, the overall survival ability is compared to the first generation.Except for the long -range weapons and the hot -melt guns without any lethality, the melee weapons will be touched several times before they are hit slowly when they are hit slowly. Swinging in the mobs is simply impossible. It is recommended that mobs directly.Spray it with hot melting and then concentrate on handling the elite monsters.
The level design is nauseous. The most difficult thing is the first few levels. The combat ability and long -range ability of the worms are very strong. There are samurai and knife and insects in melee.At the maximum difficulty of the worm, the battle points can let you die. The main weapon is hot -melt. You can't handle brain insects and remote range, but if you do n’t take hot melt, you ca n’t handle several samurai.It can only be said that the battle may be designed for cooperation.

Pel,0,196.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006601029/,"Another case of nerfing fun things and putting leashes on players in a PVE mode designed to have a power fantasy.

I guess Saber is unaware what happened with Helldivers 2, I just hope it doesn't take them as long to realize no one wants these changes. Limited ammo uses, sounds really dumb for heavies and snipers that rely on ammo but ok, tougher enemies, they already take 3/4 of the mag to get to the executable stage but ok.
-70% melta-bomb damage to bosses? It only has one use, and that was its designated purpose, what were you thinking? The worst offense being, putting the imaginary leash on teammates so if the need to restore armor is present it CANNOT be done unless teammates are nearby? Who thought that was a good decision, I would love to see how that idea was received in the board room if Saber even held a meeting for this design choice.
Either none of Saber plays their own game or they just wanted their player base to leave because playing one game would have told you that snipers, assaults, and vanguards tend to leave their allies to focus on damage dealers to help the team but now they are punished for doing so. Having to constantly check to see if your team is near you so you can restore your only source of replenish-able health is insanely stupid and means that if we use our ability to grapple, or jump pack to a distant enemy (which is what its class is literally SUPPOSED TO DO) we are punished for it by not receiving armor back.

Hart,0,30.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994056144/,"Very pretty, but if you're looking for interesting gameplay, look elsewhere.

The environments are very well designed and the graphics engine does an admirable job of bringing large hordes of enemies to life. The art team clearly loved this game and the wealth of visual inspiration found in the 40k universe makes for an environment that's consistently grimdark and occasionally breathtaking despite the dark, oppressive story beats.

However, the gameplay is too basic to remain entertaining for long. Melee is a one-button affair with a push-X-to-parry system that wants to draw comparisons to Arkham Knights but feels more like a ""push X to not die"" scene from a mid-2000s action game. You do not dictate the pace of combat and any aggression on your part is immediately punished with chip damage from ranged fire and minor foes on your flanks. That chip damage swiftly mounts into fatalities. You -must- parry and retaliate, exploiting the invulnerability allowed by the retaliation and execution animations to restore your armor, slowly wearing down swarms of foes at a pace that is simply out of character for Space Marines.

Guns are inaccurate unless you're aiming down sights, ammunition is sharply limited, and anything worth shooting is also either resilient enough to shrug off ranged fire or capable of blocking sniper rounds with a sword. If an ally engages an enemy you can pop off a few head shots to knock it into execution range, but for the most part you're better off wading into the melee horde yourself and tediously retaliating your way to victory.

The visual character customization is beautiful but harshly restricted and/or greedily monetized, the equipment specialization and character growth are slow and ineffectual until you get one of a the handful of major abilities scattered throughout a 25 level grind. Relics and other equipment make more of a difference visually than in combat effectiveness - an additional 10% damage doesn't take you from 6 heavy attacks to 5 to stun a warrior, but the max rank sword sure does look a little prettier than the starter sword.

To cap that all off, in multiplayer every player has to play as a different class - but you can't select your class and then queue into a team where you're not competing for that class spot. There's about a 1 in 3 chance that someone has already selected the class you want to play when you join a team, and you can't progress your class if you can't play it, so expect to have to leave and re-queue, sometimes multiple times in a row, in order to play a preferred class in multiplayer.

The final nail in the coffin, then, is that despite the shallowness of the gameplay and the general jank of the multiplayer system, this game is terribly short, confusingly lacking in content despite having so little depth. There are only six campaign missions, which have no replayability. The only other option for PvE are operations, but again, there are only six operations. This is a full-priced $60 game that you could finish in a day, that nonetheless expects you to grind out 48 mission completions with each class to unlock visual armor.",2024/9/7,en

Quackers,0,52.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/QuackerCracker/,"Please realise that this is literally one of the only games I've been looking forward to for a very very long time. I was hoping of actually enjoying a game for the first time in months, just for everything I feared to manifest after more than just a few hours of gameplay. Initially I thought the game was phenomenal, the weighty thump of the bolters, the tearing viscera of chainswords, the diverse abilities and a 2010s storyline packed with an explosive finale. I finished the game on the 2nd highest difficult, as reccomended, and wanted to try out more gameplay.

So I decided to play outside of the story mode.

The highest difficulty, Ruthless, shows the true colors of this game. After breezing through the first three difficulties and getting my class to high level, more issues began to arise as I became more intent on progressing my weapons. That's when the most glaring problems began to show; the combat is incredibly clunky with parries and snapshots almost guaranteeing you will be hit by 2-3 other enemies if you take them. The enemies themselves are monotonous to fight against with less AI responsiveness than even Halo Reach had, a game 14 years old. There's only six operation missions in total that most of them range from tedious to straight out not fun (people know the agony of the Heldrake mission while playing as Assault/Vanguard/Bulwark). The assault fails in any degree of melee, despite being for its namesake an ""assaulting"" class to get into close combat, meanwhile the fully-ranged heavy's best weapon is its close range multi-melta. PvP is a mess with a TTK that feels either like I'm playing HLL/Squad but swaps to Halo Reach but everyone has armor lock in an instant. Trying to play the campaign again shows how much the story was the definition of a one-time experience with much of the plotholes and abandoned storylines showing far more glaringly on the second playthrough. Almost all the weaponry is borderline identical save for the melta which is the only usable weapon in high level Operations, of which you will probably be kicked if you aren't using a melta or playing Bulwark 60%%+ of the time. The lack of mechanical flow in the melee kills any degree of skill-based gameplay with even using core mechanics like parrying and snapshots working against you 90% of the time by opening yourself up to other attacks for a solid 1+ second. In melee you are entirely powerless against any more than 3-4 enemies even if its just gaunts or tzaangors. Of which, even the most minor of enemies take several shots/hits to even stagger them (again, unless you use a melta). Tack all of this onto a subpar overall multiplayer experience with three total maps, 60-90+ second load times on a current-gen PC, an AI that would barely function as a support chatbot on a corporate website, borderline unfair enemy spawns (neurothrope vs melee-centric teams), ranged enemies that you can't even see shooting through entire buildings and walls, and to cap it all off I can't even play as a custom or my favourite chapter without hearing them recite a voice line about Ultramar or the Guilliman every 15 seconds.

It feels like they were rushed to do the bare minimum to call it a ""complete"" game, but failed to do any quality testing beyond the initial gameplay mechanics. These are all things they can, and I hope certainly will, fix in a few weeks to months of patches, but if you want a complete list of changes I would suggest and that I've seen others propose, you can read them below.

- Add I-Frames to parry/snapshots like executions currently have
- Have melee regenerate small amounts of HP on kill or increase the current healing mechanic in melee dramatically as stimpacks are way too far and few between while having no real way of getting HP back
- Nerf the melta's HP regen while buffing ranged HP regen hit (You can go from 1-100% HP in a single shot of melta vs getting maybe 10-15% of your HP back with a bolter)
- Remove the stagger from the melta (I don't think anyone can argue that having a melta on Ruthless makes the game 10x easier when the enemies can't even swing back and hordes disappear in 1-2 shots)
- Increase practically all bolter damage to actually be a real bolter and annihilate soft targets in 1-2 shots
- Rework Operations Assault entirely - Copy/pasting the current PvP Assault mechanics onto Operations, make the hammer viable with faster swings/heavies, make the fist viable by doing massive single-target damage
- Add more boss-oriented Operations or alternative endings (the final boss fight in the campaign was 10/10 and the Hive Tyrant was pretty good as well)
- More melee weapons that actually feel different. A power axe for anti-elites, eviscerator for anti-horde, and so on.
- More hordes. There's too many times where I feel like I'm fighting a probing force rather than an entire hive invasion fleet.
- Make walls actually solid and ranged enemy attacks not go through them (pretty obvious)",2024/9/18,en

Mr_KayZ,0,8.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_KayZ/,"Saber, this is a fun game. Its a co-op shooter, where we are space marines and we are fit to lead our wildest fantasies for however we want. We are super humans that can tear through enemies and make them fear us.

I don't have time for 4000 hours to drop into this game as I got university and a job to upkeep. I play games to relax. This is not what I want outta SM2. Sure add another difficulty bar, make higher levels higher and more difficult, that is fine. This doesn't mean you should make the other lower levels harder just because you felt like it. This is not the way to make a good game, this makes people hate it.

Industry-wide people hate the everloving crap outta nerfs, especially in co-op PVE shooters. Helldivers 2 is an excellent example. They had extreme nerfs which caused people top recoil and despise it, only to return when Arrowhead released the mother of all buffs to win back player loyalty. And it worked, maybe not a whole lot, but its a step in the right direction and what you need to do as well.

Nerfs are never the answer, making a game increasingly punishing for casuals isn't either. This is your Helldivers moment, Saber, don't ♥♥♥♥ this up. Buff the space marines and you will win back the gamers. Otherwise, what await you are more bad reviews as this one. Don't go down this path, it never ends well.",2024/10/20,en

Griselbrand,0,40.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/griselbrand/,"Game is fun, great action, beautiful set pieces. But my god, this game has some serious bugs to work out. And they randomly seem to get worse.

Matchmaking is horrrrible.

I spend so much time just trying to get into a match and every step along the way the game is likely to give you an error after a long load screen. Sometimes immediately upon selecting match make it gives you loading screens and then times out, sometimes you're still in your own world and someone else tries to join you and times out. Sometimes you are trying to join someone else's match and long load screen and... times out.

Then, when you finally manage to join a match with other players, half the time you've both chosen the same class and one of you is forced to leave or change to another class that you may not have leveled up high enough to the difficulty you've already selected when choosing matchmaking, you now have to quit the matchmake or risk sabotaging the match for the other players because you dont have the right perks/weapons on this character to pull your own weight.

It's just a badly designed process. And this could at least be balanced out if the game was tuned in a way that you could actually manage things solo. But that's not possible with the garbage NPCs they give you for squadmates. Unless you're max level with max level guns, you're likely not going to be able to pull off even the first operations on easy difficulty.

So much of this game needs more time to cook. Look at the subreddit and you'll see posts like where you upgrade the same weapon and some of its stats go down. Why is that a thing? Not a variant weapon, but the same one has lower stats at a higher level. It's just nonsensical stuff.

I have yet to successfully close the game via the ingame menu without it freezing. Have to alt+f4 or force it to stop via steam. At the end of every mission I either get disconnected or sit through incredibly long load times as the game hangs, then disconnects me from the squad I was with.

Oh, and then the few times I've managed to get a really solid group together and are crushing a mission, 30+ minutes in, the game can hard crash where I'm then forced to reboot my PC and there is no option to rejoin squad mates. So not only do you not get to complete the mission, you get literally zero rewards from it. No XP per kill or per objective completed while you were in the mission. XP only comes at the end of the mission... Again, who in 2024 came up with these backwards ideas and terrible net code?

This game is ultimately just not End User friendly. It wastes your time. The entire time I've been writing this I've been stuck at the end of a mission load screen and am once again going to have to alt+f4. What a mess.",2024/9/29,en

For nothing that corridors -corridors are everything very beautifully done, a lot of details, the game is certainly not a benchmark, but I definitely want to praise for graphony, juicy, bloody, dynamically.
Shooting is much better than in the first part, in principle, I probably shot 2/3 of the game than in a hand -to -hand (played in a coop, and there was someone to mess with swords).The arsenal is diverse, there are for different enemies, with different chips, but there are no wow from guns, they simply fulfill their purpose.It’s convenient and fun to shoot while there are tyranes, but a little boring.On the gamepad, by the way, the management did not like the management at all, uncomfortable, played on clamps.
“Ulta” now is different for all characters, useful in their own way, does not develop in any way.Bestiary is diverse enough for not very long passage.The meat grinder is meat, weapons of near -battle have even a pair of simple combo.
The plot is fast, overcoming, chaos, steep ultramarins, well, you know in short, a typical Varhammer 40k.The finale left a little with the thought ""and is that all?""Obviously cut for the DLC.It is played in the coopeous better, there is a whole mode for all this.

Cordic,0,84.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198194856986/,"Balancing is a big issue. Weapons are way to weak to be used in a Power Fantasy world. Recent updates show the Saber Devs did not hear the community and are taking the same path the Devs did with Helldivers2 and this will kill the community just like it did with Hellsdivers2. Nerfing weapons and grenades, parry, was not needed and the game is even less fun now. Still no way to regen health which is critical because Armour does not protect the character that much at all, so health regen is sorely missed from the first Space Marine game. Some (most) weapons like All Bolter weapons are specificly way to weak, in lore these are the main weapons for a Space Marine and they are not properly represented here at all ( add Plasma is not proper either ).

Still can not freely choose the class we want to play because the Devs limited the class to one of each per match ( So stupid to put limits on what class people can choose to play and to force them to change is unexceptable ). This is a huge problem for me as it just seems wrong to do this.

We have to go through 4 loadings screens before actually entering the game. All games need to just stop this, seriously. Then leaving a match there are several loading screen that also can not be skipped. So when you try to get into a match and you have to back out because someone else is playing the class you want to play as, you have a ton of loading screens to go through and then back through, just to try and get into a match. Hopefully you dont get disconnected from the frequent Server Disconnect errors this game has, which have been there since day 1 and Early Access.

The magnificent battle with hordes of tyranids and the battle with thousands of sons bring joy.
The visual part of the game is a separate type of orgasm.I kiss the hands of artists.
Operations.Coope of the mission with pumping its class.At the moment there are 6 of them, after 60 hours spent in them, I want to continue to recall them.In the future, of course, we are waiting for new tasks.
Campaign.Passed at the 3rd level in the coop.She is beautiful, she is magnificent.We think to take 4 difficulties.
Great localization.
Customization.Hello all the bloody raven from Dawn of War.
All the first legions of the emperor are present.There are orders, there are not many of them but still, another part of the orders of the heirs of Ultramarin in the passage season.The bloody crows are present.
I think the main advantages I noted.Perhaps I missed something.

A seasonal pass with a price tag 2199. For a comfortable game, you do not need it since this is a set of cosmetics, but the price is for it, I personally scares me.I understand that this is not extra money for developers, but still this is the price of some games.
The new game content at the request of the developers will be free.

Well, a spoon of tar.
At the moment, servers are bad.The same bastion feels unpleasant on the front line with the lags.Yes, and others are not easier.Fortunately, this is all fixable, we are waiting for a patch.
Well, you need to do something with gray HP (contested health).Bilds through weapons with a large area break this system.You can restore your full health.
I also heard about the influx of heretics with divine skills.Anti-cheat does not save.But we are not here for PVP.

The single -player battle is indeed cool, without numerical growth, and no professional restrictions.The appearance can be limited. At present, only the right shoulder armor and two weapon skin can be used in single -player campaign.

Many people have serious balance issues. As soon as the PVP is smashed, a quasi -PVE finds this.I will not say much about my PVP.The PVE weapon value has a paradoxic paradox. Gold guns have to fight the highest difficulty but it is difficult to hit the highest difficulty ... Only professional talents and appearance painting can be used to be full.In addition, this game season ticket is only qualified for you. The content itself is all coated with appearance, and you must buy it by your own liver gold coins.The benefit is that at least you have nothing to do with the strength (laughs).

Compared with the first generation, the role performance does not retreat. There are too many negative feedback in the level of the level of the PVE wasteland. The key talent of many occupations to change the game experience is too late. The role performance is not growing.return.The resources of ammunition packages are short of resources, but the enemy has various bullying dogs. The melee can block the bullets but the blood volume of the enemy group evaporates instantly.The firearms other than the hot -hanging grenade of the hot melt and the grenades can not make the enemy hard, and interrupting the enemy's behavior is the most critical factor for survival in the game. This has led to most weapons.The charging laser has become a special attack on BOSS because of numerical supermodels.At present, the status quo of PVE is not that a certain weapon is easy to use, but it cannot be played without a certain minority installation.

In terms of network, the country is difficult to use, and the accelerator may not be used, and the online system is very stupid. There is almost no abnormal self -test. The drop must return to the title interface to register.Once you are interrupted with the homeowner during the matching phase, at least you need to switch the single -player mode before cutting back to the strange machine soul soothing ceremony. Otherwise, you will match the air rotation again, and you will not wait for teammates for 40,000 years.

In general, the volume of the single -player campaign in this game is insufficient. The growth curve of multiple people is steep, the fresh period is short, the anti -cheating shape is the same, the cost of obtaining the positive feedback is high, the length of time and depth of the study is very shallow.Essence",2024/9/14,zh-cn

not having an fov slider is like not having subtitles for the hearing impaired.

It would be a 10/10 Emperor mandated purchase but there were a few gamebreaking bugs that me and my friend encountered during our playthrough that made us have to restart several times.

The pvp is skill based and requires you to move as a unit like OG halo multiplayer and the movement feels a lot like gears of war minus the cover to cover aspect of moving in that game.

The Campaign immediately entered my top 5 best campaigns along with Halo and Last of Us. The final missions is pure unfiltered fan service and I couldn't get enough of it.

The Scenarios are also awesome and provide a good bit of replay-ability with the perks and cosmetic unlocks and each class feels powerful in their own right.

One of my personal favorite things in this game has to be NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS!!!

All in all its an amazing game that I'm having a ton of fun with and i even have zero regrets when it comes to purchasing the early access either which is the first time I have done so in years.",2024/9/10,en
The Bulldozer,1,20.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198372793657/,"I really hate to do this so early on, but out of my alleged 2 hours of ""playtime"", only 20-30 minutes has actually been in control of a Space Marine. I'm not joking when I say I've simply started scrolling through twitter and watching whole YouTube videos whilst waiting for things to load, and it also turns out that despite having downloaded the game for no less than 4 hours, I am SOMEHOW missing some ""Epic Games Multiplayer Files"". For some reason, loading into the Campaign requires connecting to a server, and basically every single cut-scene has either frozen itself partway through, has had such delayed audio that it's genuinely confusing as to who's saying what unless you have Subtitles on, or flat out just crashes the game. That half an hour I've actually been able to play the game was fun, I admit, but that simply does NOT excuse how everything outside of the gameplay seems to have been handled.

Oh, and on a separate note, a friend of mine from the UK wanted me to gift this for them when it released today and I couldn't due to ""Regional Price differences"". Turns out that people in the UK are paying what is effectively an extra $12 in USD for this game compared to Americans, so please do note that if you are from that region across the big pond.

Edit: Game seems to be running a lot better now, so now that I can physically play the video game I'm changing the review. Price difference still seems to be an issue, though, so make of it what you will.",2024/9/10,en

My 2024 Goty

Man game, pure testosterone, made for who is a fan of Warhammer.It will take tears out of your eyes, finally we arrived at AAA and deserve this place.

Fast and responsive combat, Gore on display, gives you a feeling of being a super soldier.If you want Power Fantasy's appearance, play the easiest, because in the last two difficulties Titus is made of paper, and you have to be smart and see the fight as something more tactical.

Melee combat weapons are extremely strong, which makes the various bolters of the game support weapons.The hammer is the last melee combat weapon to be unlocked and is fantastic to deal with any enemy, even the bosses that will be in their way.As it was in the first game, carrying a weapon of loud damage, like a sniper, and the hammer for the rest.

Unlike the first game, Titus's ""Rage"" doesn't help you much, at least in the highest difficulties.Using Rage in the middle of a lot of enemies won't heal you anything, you have to have a vision of when you use it to fill your life bar.The game has two life systems: HP, which can only be healed with Rage and Medpacks scattered on the map (at most, you will find 4 by level, and they don't even recover their entire lives, they recover about 40% of your total life), and the armor, which will be your real life, being recovered over time or with executions in enemies.Rarely you will perform a weak enemy, it reserves the elites.The game becomes a samba where you kill hundreds of basic mobs while focusing on putting the elite in a state of execution to stay alive within the combat.

Positioning is master against both and against, but the insect hordes offer a much greater challenge than them.These damn insects will surround you both closely and far, with grenades that obstruct your way and pests that will make your vision blurred.Wizards are masters in long -range combat, but Marines are not as dangerous as cultists with snipers rifles, who together destroy their lives and put me on the ground several times.

Beautiful cutscenes, basic history, but invokes all that Warhammer represents with the overseas, angels of the empire of man, who come when the empire most needs to save the day.

Even though I'm not a fan of overseas, I really liked their characterization.Congratulations to know.",2024/9/8,pt

I’ll start with the fact that the visual in the game is just a fairy tale, and I say not only for the technical part but also for the development of locations, everything is done in the most detailed and cool, for a long time I did not focus on the backdrops honestly in the game.

The hemplex is also as simple as possible, but from the same no less spectacular. The solarmous close battle, as well as good shooting, let us feel their dominance over the others 100%. The game is not long and the gemple simply does not have time to get bored, you are highly caught up to the credits.
The plot is ordinary, without any combination, simple to disgrace, but it is played gorgeously in the form of well -adjusted rollers and dialogs during the mission, so it suited me completely, I did not expect some kind of drama or intrigue from this game.
I liked how they passed the spirit of this universe, the atmosphere and immersion at a very good level. Consider the power of the armor when the space marine is coming, or how everyone revere owes before us and is glad to our appearance very well conveys the spirit of this universe.",2024/9/22,ru

Range units are still and always will be a unbalanced mess in this game since they will always have free damage against you at any given time since you can't block or counter them except for 2 specific classes, and the infinite green sacks of poop is just crossing the line.
Zoanthropes Zoanthropes Zoanthropes. You dont have krak grenades? You dont have a sniper? You just spent 15 minutes without a single ammo cache or drops and now you have to melee these things that literally makes it impossible to do anything except dodge constantly since two of them stagger unparryable AOE attacks... except oh wait, they are flying 100% of the time and you can't melee them. I guess I will just quit mission cause the game just threw not one but two unfair enemies that alternate invincibility just because. Just pure design fail. Did I mention they also buff all enemies around them on top of everything I just mentioned? At least Neurothrope is fair and actually has sensible mechanic to kill them with melee.

Space Marine 2 is few in flaws and has plentiful amounts of awesome sections and details. The gameplay in Campaign and Operations feels very smooth and highly responsive. Control inputs won't force you to lock into an animation while fighting, so you can be swinging a melee combo one moment and in the middle of that press key to parry an enemy, and the animation will snap smoothly to parrying from what you were doing earlier.
Visually game is very impressive as well! I only spotted one pop-in in 18 hours and one model missing in Battle Barge (which was fixed by forcing a reload of environments). Some of the architecture in Battle Barge and Hive City is up to par when compared to what we got in Space Marine 1 and it was also stunning sometimes to walk around and admire the scenery developers had come up with.
Voice acting is perfect! It took me a few moments to get used to Titus' voice but it wasn't long when I was able to identify Chairon and Gadriel also while fighting Tyranids.
From acting I should move on to writing: as a lore nerd I found this game to be a great representation of canon lore, I felt a sense of brotherhood with Chairon and Gadriel, some dialogue made me genuinely laugh out loud and the final boss had couple of line deliveries that really worked for me (""pearls of wisdom"" bit etc.).

are bigger highlight is without contest are gameplay!
For me it's a good game but not at this price (when it is released)
A most classic campaign or even old school which can be a bias!But after I find that certain negative points comes out in my opinion
- Maps PvP frankly very trivial very bland without interest for me
It is a game that would have deserves to be inspired by the best in it is a good dose of inuluence at the overwatch would have been I think a good moove
- The PVE when A he has his exit to a campaign of a dozen hour and an operation mode with only 6 cards which take up the card of the countryside is really very very light I find !!
In view of the license and the inexhaustible Lor we could clearly and objectively expect better
Because yes certain try-hardware in a few hours have already punctuated all the content (co-op included)
It is a game in view of its richness where we could have expected open maps with vehicles a little at the destiny!
in short there would still be so much to say
This is to advise this game yes but wait for a price drop or that the content is strongly ettoffed I doubt that you survive and I the first has more than a hundred hours to its current content without past to something else onceYou will have unlocked 60 % of the game Repetitiveness and replayability will be right for you quickly!
A good game that is worth less than 30 euros in the current state so if you interest you expect a little for all the reasons mentioned above otherwise if you are a fan-boys and that repetition and its lack of content does not generate younot jump on it
For me a good 13/20 suits him well for the moment",2024/9/14,fr

Grafonium, locations, guns, enemies, music.Music is already breaking through to goosebumps.Obviously, the inconsistency was confused as much as possible to prevent the negative success of the first part :-) And they did it!So there are chances for continuation, and not in 10 years :-)
The plot here is presented in the format of the story about one special operation.So it does not try to convey some deep thoughts.A purely story about a small war for three planets.For Laura Vahi, this is a small war :-) And everything around the head of the character 1 part is spinning and continues its story.
But since we came here not to tell fairy tales, but to kill xenos and heretics, the game supplies us, first of all.For the glory of the emperor!
They added a mode of operations, which tells that they did the non -signatures in the campaign behind the scenes.You can play in a cooperative, but you can yourself.Well, the multiplayer is available if anyone needs him.
The disadvantages are of course.She flies out periodically.I also began to constantly fall off in one operation, so I have not passed yet, I am waiting for patches.In the campaign, I did not really like the idea with a hub between missions, becauseThis hub is just a set of corridors.Of course, there are some activity there, if you guess to reach them :-), but they are not so significant that I do not really see the meaning in it.If the game went seamlessly from the mission, to the mission simply through the Katsets, I would not even understand the difference.
In general, all this universe on pathos, like her ENT, I liked it very much.This game is the best for me in this universe as a fan of the shooters.I will nominate the game wherever possible, in the New Year's vote, if it is.I put only pluses and wait for the 3rd part, for the glory of the emperor and his treasury :-)",2024/10/31,ru

There aren't really a whole lot of weapon choices, the coop has like 8 missions to play (30-60 minutes each), and the story was decent I guess. I feel like that comparing this to other Warhammer games makes this feel like a masterpiece (almost all of them I have played have been bad), but standalone it's rather middleground or underperforming in many areas. This is like the first time I paid 60$ for a game in years, and it reminds me that often games like this tend to offer more looks than substance. If you can appreciate a more shallow, visually appealing game then this may be for you. Or if you are just a major Warhammer fan then this is a step in the right direction for the quality of this type of game.

The game ""Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine"" was able to steam it again.A rolling level of drive, linear passage, a good plot without unnecessary troubles.The fact that you need to relax after working an hour of another behind the game.
And now I happened to play ""Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2"".I admit, there were fears that the second part of the game, as is often the case with the ""Hammer of the War"", will be an order of magnitude worse than the first.But as one movie hero said - ""I was once not so mistaken.""
To begin with, the developers did not re -""invent the bicycle.""In fact, we have the same “Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine” only incredible, and most importantly competently, improved.Before us is the same Captain Titus (only in the second part he is a lieutenant).Our task, without unnecessary troubles, go forward and destroy everyone who wants to destroy you in their path.The main enemies in the second part are tyranides.And if the orcs from the first part fled to you dozens, then the tyranides will run on you hundreds, from which the drive level takes off to space heights.As in the first part, the forces of chaos will meet on your way, in the second part represented by the ""thousand sons.""
Visual and sound effects, here as they say - ""My respect!""The game world does not look so empty as in the first part, here the guards are not embarrassed to use military equipment, and many other visual chips, and the illusions of the ""thousands"" look just bombic.

Negative aspects in my opinion:
-2 When you try to enter the operation when you give you a boat, if you enter the lobby with you 2 boots with you.
Maybe I could not find such a setting when I thought that my room is closed online or my room is only for friends and looked at the settings.

-No matter what the class you do, you can find yourself playing a class you don't want when you match automatically.

-difficulty of operation mode: The difficulties of operation modes are increasing significantly after the middle level you feel that the game is difficult, especially compared to this, there is no increase in the resistance of your character.I think the more powerful cosmetic opening would be healthier.

-Powance mode is incredibly less, but I hope I will not stand on the game because the game is just coming out, more maps will come and diversity.

-When we kill the creates, I wish the blood that jumped on us would not go on time, at least when we used HEAL, it would be much better if the blood was cleaned, because our armor in the blood started to shine with a little calm and I hope I don't like it very much.

The entire theatre is much more ""alive"" than before, very often you will fight side by side with the guard, see wonderfully made models of tanks and listen to rousing speeches by devout soldiers of the Emperor.
The atmosphere is top notch, how everything sounds too and executes look nice again.

The campaign is very well done and fun to play, with GREAT surprises and events that are really cool.
Seeing the swarms of Tyranids on the screen is astonishing.

There is a problem with playing the campaign solo tho.
It is entirely possible to play the campaign on Veteran, solo, but for a first time playthrough i highly recommend against it.

I assume they balanced the Veteran campaign around at least 2 humans playing, which is tremendous fun for sure,
but solo quite some things are not difficult, just frustratingly stupid because the AI is very limited.
I can imagine double Zoanthropes are much less of a hassle, even on vet, with at least 2 ""real"" players.
The ranged damage received is through the roof too, which could be a numbers problem,
or because the ai has such poor target priority.

I have a Keyboard issue where my current input is being shut off randomly.
It happens when i walk/run or zoom in to aim. The character stops in his tracks / no longer zooms in until i press the button again and its making it very difficult to enjoy the game. It happens during fights, it happens when i have to walk somewhere.

Its NOT my keyboard, it works perfectly fine with other games, including Space Marine which i re-played tuesday and wednesday. Its only this game.


If you like 40k, Space Marines and good action buy this game and if you are on the fence about it, maybe wait for the first sale.

① Star Warrior 2 is a TPS+ACT action adventure game with 40K war hammer 40K as the IP background.The player played the previously charged Tatus company commander to the Extreme Warrior, and continued to fight for the Emperor, fighting with the Tylan Zerg and chaos, and poured the anger of the emperor.The game is still a refreshing style, but the overall screen specifications and battlefield scene shaping have been greatly improved.It is also a rare high -specification and game design that does not cross -cross the hammer 40K works, and the game also supports the online PVE action mode and the PVP combat mode. Although the stand -alone battle and the other two gameplay processes are not long, the content is relatively relatively, and the content is relatively relatively good.Not so fulfilling, but it is also a rare refreshing hammer tour.If it is not a hammer powder, it may be around 8 points, but if it is a war hammer fan, it is definitely a masterpiece that is definitely worth playing.

② The game specifications of the game highlight a sufficient funds. The first orc is actually very cool, but due to the development of funds and the restrictions of the game engine at that time, the battlefield was not so magnificent.And this time the second generation can be called a big leap.The game art style is full. Whether it is a peculiar building in various 40K backgrounds, the wonderful universe and the sub -space scene, even the texture of Astart's armor itself has a grade.As a hammer powder, I really saw the screenshot and appreciated, all kinds of goosebumps.In particular, the kind of battlefields are everywhere to combine the surrounding and lined buildings and wonderful universe vision. It can only be said that it is too romantic.Basically, whether the game is mobilized or Astart mobilization, and various battlefields such as deserters, there are many details, and many places have stopped for a long time.The gameplay gameplay is actually not much different from the previous one, and it is relatively inclined to melee, but this time it has added melee combat elements, and it also emphasizes that the execution of the killing will affect the battlefield.Amazing) But the difficulty is small compared to the previous work, especially after the armor is broken, a bunch of soldiers can make the blood bars disappear instantly.In addition, although the game battle is cool and the scene is magnificent, it is still a bit tired after repeating the military, but the process is indeed not 6-7h.

③ At the same time, this time the game emphasizes multi -person online elements, which is good or bad.The benefits are naturally the addition of online elements can greatly increase the fun of the game and preservation period.However, the disadvantage is also very intuitive. Because the stand -alone battle of the game can also be designed directly according to the online, and the AI ​​of the game is very mentally handicapped, it is common to stuck.Red temperature is inevitable.The production team still lacks polishing these elements. For example, if there is a level, you need to adjust the four antennas. It must be covered by one person according to the other two of the organs. If many people are definitely not a matter, but if you play with a single machine, you need to press for a long time to press the old for a long time.AI, AI really watched the small soldier beating you without cover, and let you crazy about blood.There is also one type of task in the back, which can really vomit you blood.The game PVE action mode is simply a nightmare of the liver emperor. In fact, the design of this mode is very clever. The PVE level is the other side of the main line.He played, and he also felt like to play with Titus.However, the production team may want to lengthen the time of the game. This model is simply liver.The level of several arms of the game is separated by the level, up to 25 levels, and the upgrade skills point requires money. Unlocking various armor components requires 37 pairs each. Each weapon separates experience.Level is still separated.The action mode has a total of 6 levels. This requires you to play repeatedly hundreds of times, even if someone chats online, it can't stand it.The PVP experience is also very poor. You can only hold a group. There is no feeling of competition. Now there are even plug -in (Little Blue Bear, you really have to add bugs, what is useless?).In short, although the quality of the game is good, there are really many places that need to be updated.

Since I have only played the campaign so far, I only refer to this.
Space Marine 2 offers action and slaughter in abundance.If you enjoy hack & slay, you will love this game.
The gameplay in the campaign is appealing and challenging.The control with a mouse or gamepad works perfectly and it will never be boring to dismember its enemies in beautiful graphics.
Unfortunately, you have to say that there are still a few technical defects.For example, the game always crashes when I want to end it.
There is also no manual storage function.Unfortunately, the game only saves automatically, on certain checkpoints.
Likewise, the lack of a 21: 9 or 32: 9 support, prevents an even higher assessment on my part.
But if you can overlook these shortcomings, you get a really good action game that is really in a good mood.
Therefore I would currently give a 7.5/10.
Everything in all I would like more games of this kind.Games in which the focus is on the fun of the game and not just working on an ESG checklist.

And finally - a full cooperative for three people.This is a worthy receiver SM1, personally I stick in cm2 with a high and stuck for sure.And Saber has long established themselves as masters of their craft, for Timeshift - the game of my childhood, was ultra of the soldered.Like Will Rock, like World War Z. Therefore, if you have problems with the game, I am sure that they will be corrected.But it’s better not to play in cm2 if you don’t have a 6 GB video card or more.

Well, in general, this is the only contender for the game of the year.This year, in fact, except Mullet Madjack, Alone in the Dark, Hellblade 2 and Hades 2 came out either ramics, or HELLDIVERS 2 which turned into feces, or frank feces.The only one who can really compete with Space Marine 2 is Hmrih2 in October.And that’s all, stupidly without competitors, for the year mega went rotten for the year.But okay, we don’t wait but get ready.

I felt the game completely, I went to the veteran.A veteran is an imbalance complexity, but it was passable, it took me 8 hours to pass.In the cooperative, play plus minus as in solo, but in the operation mode, the coop drags.The multiplayer also has a good, purely classic game, without any jokes except skins + games go quickly (from 5 to 15 minutes).In general, Kaif Shuther, for a long time did not play such a peppy and extinguishing action.But of course, against the background of Vermintide 1-2, I like less, because not a 40k fan.

""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2"" feels like a breath of fresh air in today’s gaming landscape, crafted by skilled artists and developers who clearly understand the community’s hunger for an unfiltered, raw gaming experience. This game is a love letter to fans, unapologetically delivering a brutal, power-fantasy experience that stands in stark contrast to the tired formulas of modern AAA titles.

In an era plagued by bloated open-worlds, tedious ""complex"" characters, and invasive microtransactions, SM2 stays true to its roots. The result? A fully immersive journey that strips away the unnecessary and focuses on the essentials: visceral combat, duty, discipline, courage, and brotherhood. If you played the first Space Marine, you'll instantly connect with the tone and spirit of this sequel—it's all about men who get the job done, no matter the odds. It is obvious that the setting is taken seriously, and nothing seems out of place, the protagonists BELONG, they are not forced in.

Even though the co-op and campaign content might seem light in comparison to other games, the sheer fun and intensity of the gameplay more than make up for it. And while it's not the biggest game out there, every moment of SM2 is crafted with precision and care.

Whether you’re playing with friends, strangers, or even bots, the experience is consistently thrilling. Kudos to the developers at Saber Interactive for pulling this off in today's gaming climate, and a special thanks to the publishers for respecting the creative vision.

The Kingdom of Ultramar, also known as the subseector of Ultramar, is the feudal star empire as part of the Imperium of mankind in the segment of Ultim.The Order of Adeptus Astartes Ultramarins runs here, and the head of this empire is the master of the Order, which bears the title of Bishop Macragga and Vladyka Ultramar.

A distinctive feature of the subsector is a strong friendship between the local population and the orders of the XIII Legion.During the Great Crusade, the native world of the Legion of the Ulgon, Macragg, supplied the XIII legion with recruits and equipment.After the end of the terrible events of Horus heresy, candidates began to recruit from all worlds of the small empire.This space is ultramar, the star kingdom of ultramarins.

Ultramarins - XIII of the original twenty legions of the cosmodesant.Now one of the most famous orders of adeptus Astartes.

The Ultramarino Legion waged the emperor’s wars with the help of judgment, discipline and determination;Each warrior sought to imitate his primarch in everything.This most numerous of all the legions of the cosmodesant was a longtime defender of the possessions of the Imperium in the Galactic East.

The strategic preferences noticed: a universal attack, a focused extermination, planetary blockade, operations to free and bring to submission to the limited theater of military operations. Buckets immensely devoted to their primarch Robaut Gilliman, ultramarines blindly follow the Astartes Code.Ten thousand years they fought as described on the pages of this scripture.Other orders can easily tear out the words of Gilliman from the context and adjust to themselves, but not ultramarins.The Astartes Code is the work of great wisdom, and these warriors do not see the point of arguing to it.Unreasonable examples of self -sacrifice and self -discipline allowed the inhabitants of ultramar to carry sacred knowledge and faith through ten thousand years to the future.

The Astartes Code contains hundreds of description pages for any conceivable tactical situation on the battlefield and many options for solving the problem.Each warrior of the Order memorizes the content of the Code by heart, so that a whole company acts as a single organism.The wisdom of millions of imperial generals, soldiers and officers is concentrated on the pages of the Astartes Code, in it a warrior can find everything: from heraldry and insignia, to the instructions for planetary assault.

Pros:
-Great graphics
-Cool executions
-The audio is immersive
-A lot of armor customization options
-The devs seem to appreciate Warhammer and try to stay true to its lore.
-Story is well done

Cons:
-Braindead AI in operations (maybe the worst I've seen in the past decade). I really cannot stress how awful they are with the sniper-bot being borderline an enemy.
-The AI don't seem to level or change based off your level or difficulty
- Bolt weapons are trash for the most part The devs have increased the damage of the bolt weapons by about 10-15%. Have to test.
-Tyranids call for reinforcements from across the zone, absurdly quickly, and still soak multiple headshots without flinching
-The operations are not consistent in difficulty. I could play average difficulty 3 times and get 3 vastly different experiences in challenge level
-
-Devs are slow to update anything meaningful
-Devs apparently don't seem to communicate on server maintenance. My wife and I were literally at the last health bar of the heldrake and we were disconnected.
-It's borderline impossible to complete the harder difficulties by yourself with said braindead ai without cheesing which is a problem considering weapon upgrades are locked behind finding armory data at these difficulties.
-Probably just my opinion but the Chaos are just boring to fight. They stand around and shoot and that's about it. I know they're supposed to be husks for Tzeentch but they can't take cover? Or use any basic tactics like using high ground or covering their allies?

Gameplain game is an action from a third person with all the ensuing.We get the task and go cut the path from point A to point B. Here I note, the locations are ideologically “corridor”, but the developer tried and gave the most diversity in the fresh air and at least wandering in the dull corridors of the plants (but where without it).On the periphery, something explodes periodically, breaks and a different motion occurs, in every possible way emphasizing the scale of what is happening.The benefit of the schedule did not disappoint and everything looks great, helping immersion in what is happening on the monitor screen.The arsenal for bringing to agreement will definitely not amaze your imagination, but you can find something cut, automatic or semi -automatic you can find it without difficulty.

Management is normal, there are simple combo for cold weapons, tags on enemies about a blocked \ non -blocked attack.Everything is fine, but only until the moment when the attacking mobs becomes very many, everything risks merging into porridge and forces to make constant somersaults.He himself went through the game in Solo, on the Veteran and periodically met the moments where the game did not allow to take a break, in Pati it would not be relevant.Boodles help a little on the battlefield, but you should not lay strong hopes on them.In general, if you do not plan to attract comrades to the passage, they are not worthless to stuffiness and just want to relax, then the first two options of difficulties will be the best choice.

I also note the local PVE mission coop - ""battle"".They become accessible gradually, as they pass through the plot, slightly supplementing the main branch of the actions of GG.Choose the attracted class of the space marineer, weapons, the level of complexity and go to shred all living things with two more comrades or random players.Very cheerfully played at the first acquaintances with locations.In parallel, the local currency, the experience and level, which are necessary for changing the appearance of the online character, the appearance of weapons and pumping of the peak tree, are farm there.In a word - Grind.

There is also a PVP of battles, but this is already for an amateur.The passage of this regime will not affect the impression of the game.

The plot here is simple and unpretentious, we are standardly trying to prevent a disaster, but it turns out that not everything is so simple and some hidden forces can be involved here.Just right, so that the player is not overloaded with information against the background of what is happening on the screen.The passage time will vary around 8-9 hours.

As a result, this project is not perfect and, if desired, you can get minuses and shortcomings, but there are no perfect games.Here, an exciting company allowing you to visit three worlds and feel like a brutal space marineer who is overcoming everything in the world goes to his goal.And the visual component helps to better feel this immersion.Saber's domestic developers did a great job.I am sure that this project was worth impressive forces and nerves ... and they coped.

Contra:
Short story (6 missions that are about 1 hour), no widescreen support (changes soon), first only 6 pvvet missions (again about 45-1h long and in themselves they also belong to the story this yearCome according to Roadmap) If you are also a FPS-Ho3 you need Lossless Scaling (unless you have a 3070+), relatively repetitive without horde mode, cross play still leads to long loading times, servers are not yet perfect

D e i m o S,1,10.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DocOfUrBody/,"Greetings!This review as usual for you and my bipolar, I and my bipolar.
Well, let's get down (it is not necessary to write it every time, otherwise they will probably not understand)
The game meets us with a juicy count and brutal narrative (what, everything is very serious here, without a story?
Literally already in the training mission, you will feel the physical severity and power of your character.
Nevertheless, the entry is quite sharp and throws it immediately into battle, so that, perhaps, there will be many questions unfamiliar with the game.
This world is full of its own terms and free interpretations of your usual things.
In view of the fact that I am not a fan of Varhamer, but I am familiar with almost the whole Laura (yes, not at all a fan, whom you are deceiving)
Everything that happens on the screen is quite logical and logical for me, I recommend that the resters trust the rest.
They tried to, albeit with a roll, but slowly tell the story along the way with what was happening.(I still want more exposition at the beginning)
But at least a couple of 3 hours of video about ENT, race, etc.Still, I recommend that you look at Utababa (or 10, well, at least 5)

The first impression was - as if they took the 5th and added their native Roy technology.
We also cut the alien monster (brown Pokemon) with a pilome (pyloric) and shreds the swarm of an alien monster.
In general, games are related by the abundance of steep pathos rollers and bloody battle per unit of time.(Unfortunately, including battles - also monotonous)

We played in a cooperate-the game requires immersion for 40-60 minutes for each mission, which is even worse than a rink in any mob-to-game, becauseIt is worth interrupting you to someone - everything flies to hell at once and you don’t want to play after a couple of breaks.
And since progress is not preserved in any way, you will replay everything from the beginning.
Which again kills the immersion.
For a visual, the game receives 10k, but for a monotonous hire -like gameplay above 7 does not pull.
So play at my own peril and risk, I personally do not want to continue.
Cook for several hours in a row when you are not worried (I am still deprived of such luxury)

There is no point in talking about the advantages, everyone has already seen everything according to the trailers that she looks amazing on all fronts and this is really so, but, several fronts managed to lose.
For those who are going to play the difficulties of the ""Death Angel"", it is not worth it, just because of the combat system.Constantly lacking first -aid kits and without deaths, even with all the dexterity, it will simply be impossible:

1. Due to the incredibly well-aimed enemies that are pixels through tiny pixels, some enemies will be spaced with very strong attacks, such attacks are not blocked in the rifts / evasion / retorting or you either accept fate, or have managed to hide.Of course, there are two cells of the armor, but they are demolished every second even after finishing up if you are in a heap of enemies who boil around and attack who.
One could still resolve the question if the finishing of special enemies added health, but it does not add and finishing special enemies gives exactly the same as the usual ordinary beetle - a cell of armor, which will be immediately played.
2. AI allies when playing without friends are simply unbearably dumb.They finish off the opponents when it is not necessary, when you yourself are running to finish, or do not finish off at all while you are busy with other enemies at the other end of the arena, he leaves the condition and continues to beat you.
They decide to raise you for half a year, even if their boots stand right on your head, they wait for the drum, wait and rest.They inflict damage and even help to kill, but 99% of the arena is cleaned precisely by the player, with due good luck they will help 5 percent more than usual.
It is clear that they don’t need to give them for the player, but help in such conditions could have provided, at least the first -aid kits would have been thrown out of nowhere during the very harsh conditions of the battle.
AI promise to correct in the nearest patch, but so far it is like this.

The difficulty could be excellent and sane, if not for these disadvantages that spoil the impression of passage.Not critical, but it would be comfortable playing on a veteran, if you want to not only crush, but the difficulty bites slightly.And there are no achievements for the angel of death, you can start on any comfortable.

Final bossfite.Refers only to the complexity of the ""Angel of Death"".
Well, this is some kind of nightmare.Firstly, it is very, very protracted and not without turning the boss into a regular sponge for damage.Secondly, due to the fact that the camera is not in the center of complexity with some attacks, and there is a lot of damage.So from some point, the boss begins to rush strictly in all directions and make noise, and the readability of attacks occurs in the color of the blow and the sound that it is about to be applied.",2024/9/20,ru

Epic Launcher+Antique 2

I've been waiting for a long time since last year, and I decided to buy it if the early evaluation was not smashed.
GTX 3070 QHD Game Automatic Settings, Balanced Mode, 60 ~ 80 frames, so the optimization is well optimized.

The game is getting harder as the games that come out these days, and there are many situations where you need to study the game to play the game on a wide open world, numerous gimmicks, and complex skill trees.

Torn, uh, feet, long!

The combat style is close to 7 ranged 3 ratio, with a long -range battle and a ranged feeling.This is because the maintenance will increase only when the short -range paring is recovered to the advantage and execution.

It is not burdensome for beginners because they tell the screen of paring timing and not guard avoidance timing.It's been a long time since I sliced, defeated, shoots, and torn as it was.In particular, when the boss attacks are continuously paralleled, and when they break the casserole with a gap shot, they make the illusion of becoming a soul petrogant.

I feel like I'm a bit of a flavor of the flavor in the 5th era !!!Sarah!Especially when fighting a large enemy, the taste is just a new day of the day.

Kriev,1,76.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kriev/,"Brothers, this game stands as a beacon of the Emperor’s might, a war hymn to His eternal glory.

The campaign of Space Marine 2 is pure cinema, peak masculinity, but in the raw, honorable sense, not the forced ""feelings"" of modern (S o n y) entertainment. It is a worthy successor to the original Space Marine staying true to the true Warhammer 40k spirit, from the grimdark aesthetics and sharp dialogue to the visceral combat and unforgettable catchphrases, this game is steeped in the essence of the 40k universe. It definitively passes the vibe check.

There is no weakness here, no false sentiment, only the unyielding strength of the Adeptus Astartes. This is no charade of emotion from the weakling masses of modern Terra.

This sequel does honor to its predecessor, as any true son of Guilliman honors the gene-seed of his primarch. The game is the very essence of the 40k made manifest.

While fighting through Tyranid swarms, you witness Cadian squadrons holding the line against an unending tide of enemies. These moments offer a powerful sense of scale, while you may be the protagonist, you're just one cog in the massive war machine of the Imperium. The game does an excellent job showcasing the Imperium’s many parts, from the Astra Militarum and their discipline shouting Cadia stands while being charge by a swarm of gaunts, the Admech with their arrogance, disdain for the flesh and their many rituals to please the Machine Spirit to the zealous and fanatic Ecclesiarchy and, of course, the ever-present bureaucratic nightmare of the Administratum.

On the performance side, Space Marine 2 handles remarkably well, even when the screen is full with enemies and chaos. The fluidity helps maintain immersion, ensuring that you never lose sight of the epic scale and intensity of the battles and the scale of the conflict.

The companion AI, while functional, can be a bit off sometimes, often leaving enemies stunned without finishing them off. If you're not there to clean up after them, those enemies will recover and come back into the fight.

The co-op features are well-implemented, allowing you to seamlessly join your friends sessions via Steam or using an invite code. While playing with random players works fine, there are occasional slowdowns due to the lengthy loading screens when joining or leaving sessions. This could definitely be better as it can get a bit annoying.

Of course, as a game, the game's handle is really good for melee occupation, but it is unfortunately that the game is really not suitable for melee (melee occupation is very prison)
This game refers to many of the same type of games, including and is not limited to 40K dark tide of war hammers. They have the same remote unit design. After the maximum difficulty, two remote soldiers can be two shots and blood.One shot (the high enemy unit hurts the sky high)
Of course, you don't have to worry that all monsters in this game are plural, and you don't have to worry about whether you can't meet the strange situation.(There is a very abstract monster in the case of the value of the sky)
If you are curious, how do we have the ability to fight against such people, after all, we are Astart, so we can get up to 4 A4 paper shields to resist the monster's attack. The opponent is the most ordinary.The miscellaneous soldiers also need 4 times to break our defense, and even the most common long -range soldiers need 3 to spend 1 second to break your shield.The character's skills only need to reply to your shield in the next 2-3 seconds in the next 2-3 seconds of the monsters like a tide.Shield, of course, we can also use friendship and magic to quickly get a shield, but it is very good that the same unit can only have one person using friendship magic. There is often a human creature full of blood.Find the Blood Teammate's Life Monster to use friendship magic. Of course, you don't have to worry about it. Under normal circumstances, you will not match your teammates, but if you unfortunately use friendship magic to restore a little shield, you don't need to worry about it, you don't need to worry, you don't needThe mobs behind you will still use an unsatisfactory corner to use no prompt attacks to remove your A4 paper shield or pity (poor shield mechanism and poor physical fitness)

If you don't know Warhammer 40k, you'll understand that you are doing somehow, but you often don't know what you're saying.
It is a thick story with more than 40 years of history, so it may be inevitable to some extent, but I thought it would be nice to have a glossary at least.

Story mode can be cleared in a little 10 hours
Regarding the battle, I felt that it was TPS, but the proximity was the main than shooting.
In the game video PV, etc., the small fish enemies that appear, but the slightly strong enemy that springs on the road will reduce the stiffness of Parry, or if you do not avoid it, you can clear it just by hitting the attack button repeatedly.Note that it is not sex.

There are two types of coops, the main story can be cooperated, but it is a mode of the main character Titus and other ultramarine characters, making it a mode with no customization.
There is an operation mode from a soldier viewpoint that is active behind the main story.
Operation mode is created by original space marine, the role of each class, weapon growth, and the mode with parks, so it is necessary to clear the main story stage to play the operations mode, so immediately after purchase.Playing operations mode is virtually impossible.

In the creation of the original space marine, some decals of the successor fighter were also well prepared, so it was good to be able to select colors based on the Citadel color basis, but it is possible to determine the color for each part or decal.Due to the customizability, it seems that there is no way to create a corps that only paint fist like Crimson Fist, and we are looking forward to improving it in the future.


★ Good setting to know before playing this work.(No explanation in the work)
Q. What is Space Marine?What is the emperor?
A. The emperor was suffering from various troubles when human beings entered the universe, but the emperor was saved as a leader.
Furthermore, the emperor uses the gene of the emperor to create an Android.
The existence born in that way is the primary space marine ""primark (general)""
The 20 born primarks are scattered in space in the work of the evil gods living in a different world, ""Keos"" (the gods of chaos), in a childcare capsule.
The primarks are scattered, but the emperor creates a space marine based on the primark gene.
The emperor will re -meet with the scattered primarks that have grown on various planets, led by the created Space Marine Army to unify the galaxy.

Q. Why are you fighting between the same space marine?
A. Each reunited primarks with characteristics as the leader as the leader, creating a corps, and it seemed that the unification of the galaxy was going well due to the space marine, but the chaos (chaos gods) suggested Horus, one of the primarks.A large -scale civil war occurs.
Here, nine Emperor's loyalty and nine major reversal of Horus, who rebelled against the emperor, are divided.(Of the 20 people, the remaining two are erased from the record)
Known as Horus Helethy (10,000 years ago, it is also called 30k)
Horus was defeated, and other major reversal space marine fled to distortion (warp), but the fatal emperor became a plant human.
Even if it reached 40k, the great reversal, who fled to distortion, continues to fight as Keos Space Marine receiving blessing from the gods of chaos.
Space Marine Everyone Brother!Death to the heretics of the traitor!

Q. What is Zeno?
A. One of them is the enemy Terranid of this work of a different orientation
There are other orks, tauen pirates, necrons, etc.

Q. What is Robut Gilliman?
A. Space marine protemark with blue armor marked with Ω in the opposite direction
Space Marine should be like this!Those who made the ""Scriptures of Battle"" with such contents

Q. What is Cadian?
A. About the people of the planet Cadia

Although the campaign is a little short and may be expanded in the future with one or two expansions you have to say that Warhammer has really delivered 40,000: Space Marine 2 in all other matters.The campaign can hardly be surpassed in bombast, the graphic performance is really optimally staged and very often lets you be amazed with an open mouth.

The co-op missions are also a lot of fun and tell the history of the other group alongside Captain Titus and his team.

The character development is separated in the co-op missions and the multiplayer and lets a lot of scope to create his desired marine (or an existing chapter).

The multiplayer is just beautiful accessories like the first part back then and can also be fun if you play with the right people.But even as in the first part, the variety of tickets is not big, the hitRregistration is not really the best and it can quickly become monotonous.

It must be said that the need for optimization is still required at the present time.The game is Strak CPU-heavy and many CPUs, especially Intel 13/14 generation run very hot with this title and are very happy to reach your limit.Good cooling should already be available until it was reworked.Undervolting should be almost mandatory in these generations.Otherwise the game is almost bug -free and runs really well.

Yi,0,70.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198404181904/,"After playing for 40 hours, the view is that the feeling of 40K is a very low -degree of completion.
Personal core point of view
PVE does not make people feel the sense of cutting, and my melee weapon feels stuck.
PVP has a fascinated garbage that is not as good as the page tour.
1. From the story, this game feels like a three -person Superman. The scene is indeed very large. The plot is pure American personal hero film. Then what?I can't see Astart's tactical literacy. The boss is classic to suppress the rights. If you have objections and put forward tactical ideas, you will blush and your neck and stress you as the company commander. The extreme soldier?Then talk about the problem of the three teams. The gunfire on the battlefield is still arguing there to fight there to make a temper there. The Star Army next to the Star Army sacrificed to defend the empire. Tactical literacy is famous for its political mind?Is it possible to let you go more than the chaos?
2. Game playability, two major modes PVP and PVE
The problem of PVP is very large, the production is extremely rough, and the game such as the life and death sniper that is not even inferior to the page game is not even a small map. Is this a Star Warrior?Or is it a primitive fight?The program UI rough is the same as a page game.The overall idea of ​​the PVP is that every occupation of Overwatch has skills and every occupation has a special weapon without any more. You can learn the COD killing rewards. Besides Flying, you can't look up at all below.
The problem of PVE is not as big as PVP but it is also very against the sky. In the past, this type of game was either melee and unparalleled. The zombie flesh flew into the tank and was nervous. The cattle rider's monkey and AOE spitting the single kill with the bull can brag. What are the Star Warriors 2?The melee cutting grass is not hand -of -hand and is abstract. I am afraid it is difficult to keep up with the dull tide group. After pulling the difficulty, it is even more prominent after pulling the difficulty. As a result, the difficulty did not change before the team dared to run customs.
The mechanism of PVE is simply that the firearms are only available to play with hot -melt grenades and plasma. The core daddy system of the melee system game is born for this gadget, because the guns are not specifically prepared at all preparations. The mechanism of special income (don't tell me the pure value of the hot -melt BUG to the light), melee weapons have made three forms for you in order to torture, namely the three attributes of the backbound balance block That is, the core mechanism to fight counterattack to improve the first one is to extend the counterattack window. The second is the window that is default counterattack. The third one cannot fight back. The counterattack can also give the mob's scraping the second, the third one that seems to have given it against the sky is actually still in jail because the core counterattack mechanism cannot be triggered. Back to the white value, you will only be interrupted in the strange pile and you will be interrupted with the warrior's red knife)
You do n’t unlock the complete skill tree or several core professional skills, just go to jail and say that you are your thunder hammer!Which PVE's profession requires frequent release skills to get a big CD?From the thunder hammer to the pistol proficiency, right? The output of the early scraping was interrupted and the charged person was still dying by the remote monster. Is this a PVE? A game that does not allow players to cool?",2024/10/10,zh-cn

Gameplain game is an action from a third person with all the ensuing.We get the task and go cut the path from point A to point B. Here I note, the locations are ideologically “corridor”, but the developer tried and gave the most diversity in the fresh air and at least wandering in the dull corridors of the plants (but where without it).On the periphery, something explodes periodically, breaks and a different motion occurs, in every possible way emphasizing the scale of what is happening.The benefit of the schedule did not disappoint and everything looks great, helping immersion in what is happening on the monitor screen.The arsenal for bringing to agreement will definitely not amaze your imagination, but you can find something cut, automatic or semi -automatic you can find it without difficulty.

Management is normal, there are simple combo for cold weapons, tags on enemies about a blocked \ non -blocked attack.Everything is fine, but only until the moment when the attacking mobs becomes very many, everything risks merging into porridge and forces to make constant somersaults.He himself went through the game in Solo, on the Veteran and periodically met the moments where the game did not allow to take a break, in Pati it would not be relevant.Boodles help a little on the battlefield, but you should not lay strong hopes on them.In general, if you do not plan to attract comrades to the passage, they are not worthless to stuffiness and just want to relax, then the first two options of difficulties will be the best choice.

I also note the local PVE mission coop - ""battle"".They become accessible gradually, as they pass through the plot, slightly supplementing the main branch of the actions of GG.Choose the attracted class of the space marineer, weapons, the level of complexity and go to shred all living things with two more comrades or random players.Very cheerfully played at the first acquaintances with locations.In parallel, the local currency, the experience and level, which are necessary for changing the appearance of the online character, the appearance of weapons and pumping of the peak tree, are farm there.In a word - Grind.

There is also a PVP of battles, but this is already for an amateur.The passage of this regime will not affect the impression of the game.

The plot here is simple and unpretentious, we are standardly trying to prevent a disaster, but it turns out that not everything is so simple and some hidden forces can be involved here.Just right, so that the player is not overloaded with information against the background of what is happening on the screen.The passage time will vary around 8-9 hours.

As a result, this project is not perfect and, if desired, you can get minuses and shortcomings, but there are no perfect games.Here, an exciting company allowing you to visit three worlds and feel like a brutal space marineer who is overcoming everything in the world goes to his goal.And the visual component helps to better feel this immersion.Saber's domestic developers did a great job.I am sure that this project was worth impressive forces and nerves ... and they coped.

Ravn,0,25.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119673699/,"Preface before reading, I don't want the game to fail I just think it won't succeed without the heed of criticism. I never write reviews, but this game is being overly praised while being seriously flawed.

Pros:

- Great writing true to the warhammer universe.

- They included many chapters and their heraldry with a great framework to expand upon.

- Everything visually looks wonderful and grim in the best way possible. Not too taxing on my gpu or cpu.
(NVIDIA rtx 3070 ti, intel i9-12900K)

- Similarities and nods to the previous space marine game in the series.

- Audio sounds 'okay' except for the voice act which is superb.

- A fair amount of attention to detail throughout the game which is very nice to see.

Cons:

-Connectivity, nothing more must be said just look at the other reviews.

- Multiplayer being the main staying power of the game feels like an after thought and not fully thought through before implementing it. Of course not everyone cares about the multiplayer, but I see it as what would increase the longevity of the game.

- The melee system overall is very weak, especially in multiplayer. Parrying an enemy doesn't stun or hamper the other player in anyway in multiplayer. You can just wail on them until you when but even that is flawed because you are better off just using your bolter to win melee fights. The firearms do significantly more effective damage and don't lock you in a terrible animation. No aim punch or stagger from melee means closing the distance as a play still is dead, you should just play tactical or heavy every match. Locking your enemy into melee is a decided strategy and is not present.

- Getting kills in multiplayer is extremely underwhelming resulting in both the victor and the defeated just feeling frustrated. It would be rewarding if they care over the execute system from the campaign, maybe give you invincibility frames or just expedite the animation time to leave it for when you have opening for the time it would take.

- It's hard to tell when you are being hit, possible adding armor shift under fire or some sort of light stagger would fix that.

- Hitting enemies doesn't feel nearly as impactful as similar games and for a super human clad in metal. The bolter variants do appropriate damage but it doesn't feel like you are shooting anyone. Maybe this is the SFX department but it just feels a bit hollow.

- Biggest problem with the campaign that I experienced was enemies shooting my teammates and me through the world terrain or cargo containers, anything really it just seemed the ranged enemies could hit you from anywhere through anything. A problem with the engine or the assets I'm not sure, hopefully this gets fixed.

- No friendly fire seems like a mistake, I get its more casual friendly but I believe it does a great deal of immersive damage and also unbalances multiplayer. I can stack grenades on top of melee fights with my teammates just killing the enemy team and also it does damage yourself with some like the shock grenade.

- The physics system needs some work non-static items seem to be near weightless.

- So many great opportunities for fresh game modes but nope they went with the tried and true which is fine. Hopefully they get a little creative with the upcoming modes and maybe pull some ideas from the tabletop.

- A cover system seems not necessary, but would improve the combat immersively and tactically.

Conclusion:

The basics are there but it needs a lot of work, balancing, and straight up system changes. Sadly as a warhammer fan I would have to recommend against purchasing until the game gets some major polishing and a few changes to the core. Multiplayer could be a gem for this game.

It's a puppet.
My plague 3300h can TS, the dark tide 700h golden storm.If you feel that the above data can not represent the understanding of the game itself and the technical perspective, it should be that I am not loyal enough
Plot
The plot is about 7-8h (it is worth praising). However, as the front plot of the PVE game, there is no character reward, but it is divided into 4 difficulty.Because when the characters do not have the ability to point the weapon and no skill points, the nightmare begins->

Start the game that is the default Tyrannosaurus clause: The EPIC online service is bound to the default. You must download it first to play. Needless to say more with EPIC compatibility.At that time, you thought it was a bit of an exclusive to EPIC. As a result, STEAM is now doing this?Speaking of wwz, this game screen is like the wwz that changes the skin. It is quite impressed, but the weapon strike feedback is really as soft as WWZ. The dark tide next door can really throw him a few streets.The quality of the weapon is divided into white -green and purple gold. There are different types of weapons under each quality. You can upgrade with experience. The weapon upgrade can have skill points. The weapon can directly feed the material full level.In other words, if you play 5 can be full of quality experience and weapon experience. As a result, although the weapon is full, you still have to play 5 to gain quality experience. The quality does not rise to the next level.Where is the significance of weapons?IntersectionWhen you play N3, you will get stuck when you get the purple drawings, because you will find that the weapon cannot rise without the level and there are more skill points and attacks.Go, the mobs touched a grid, and the Tan Gang's pottery Astart was as fragile as wearing a newspaper. Some occupations were only two squares., Especially chaos, the painful people can stop the position directly, spray fires and shoot, and play you like a kite. You and him are scratching like boots and it is strange.The weapon is to attack the trick to attack the trick, and when you think you can cut it, you will give you a QTE to interrupt the rhythm of your operation.I don't know what type of this is between, and each point cannot be reached.Now there are only a hot -melt gun, but only three occupations are available, and because there is a blood back blood BUG, ​​it can continue with survival.
Regarding the problem of network cards and matching, it is recommended that you look at your own network or accelerator. There is no server in Steam games in China. Non-P2P online requires that accelerators are common sense. Opening a accelerator 7-80 delay will not card at all.As for the refusal to report an error, it is not clear that I have never encountered it.

This is even more heavy. It may be due to the lack of WWZ content, so it has added the PVP mode to extend the game time, but a PVP has 200 points for win!A person is only 1 point, even if you shoot a shot one in a second.Yes, yes, there will be no day.You can also guess your nationality.It also added PVP content to achievement, and the skin obtained in the future does not know if it will be obtained from PVP.

If you think it is caused by my dishes, please take a look at the original words of the famous big guy AVP2: 1) Weapon imbalance and fewer weapons; 2) The basic logic of melee is problematic, and the income and risks are not proportional (Except for the play of individual close -up mechanisms, such as playing against the shield guard, but this play is very single); 3) PVE's wasteland transition period is too long, and the player's combat power improves the powerful talent brought by the level unlocking, leading to the preliminary experienceIt is very prison; on the other hand, there is a lack of a certain depth of LOOT system. If you play it behind you, you can't kill it, but you can't kill it. It is difficult to support the needs of long -term operations.

Haywire Hayley,0,17.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/haywirehayley/,"I really want to love this game but as someone who's hugely into the Tide games by Fatshark I just don't think I can. It fails to capture the fantasy of being a space marine, in my opinion, and has multiple fundamental issues with its combat system. I think the simplest way to summarise it would be to say that it feels like I'm controlling a cumbersome vehicle that barely responds to my commands as opposed to a superpowered human being.

Skill issue, you might say? Well, no, not really. In fact, one of my main problems is that the (incredibly arbitrary, incidentally) blue parry indicator appears TOO EARLY and if you respond to it extremely promptly then you instead fail the parry and are punished rather than appropriately rewarded. This can be adjusted to, of course, but it feels terribly unintuitive.

That leads me to how only SOME attacks have audio cues and others don't... Why? Darktide has an audio cue for every melee attack made against you, and it feels great. Sound design in general isn't great here, with boltguns almost sounding like suppressed rifles. The gun strike mechanic also feels wildly inconsistent, and there's the lovely fact that your teammates can inadvertently prevent you from pulling these off.

But whiner, why do you keep making comparisons to Darktide? Well, I'd argue Darktide is the best 40k shooter available right now and I don't see any reason to buy this one while it exists unless you truly hate always online components or are one of those (boring... sorry) people who is specifically obsessed with space marines.

PvE operations difficulty is MASSIVELY inflated compared to the Normal mode of the campaign which I picked in the hopes of having a fun power fantasy experience. For the most part, the campaign does an OKAY job of achieving this despite the aforementioned issues - and has some amazing setpieces - but the starting operations difficulty is a mess. You are woefully underpowered for whatever reason and are expected to grind to achieve the physical power necessary to actually feel like a badass as opposed to a worthless chump.

Something is wrong when I feel infinitely more like a space marine in Darktide as my pathetic little stim addict almost-heretic on even the highest difficulty. I've not even mentioned how painfully unbalanced the Thousand Sons are compared to the tyranids. Inconsistency seems to be the name of this game.

I'm entirely unimpressed by the weapon variety seen here. Bolters, bolters and more bolters. Most of the ranged weapons are simply bolter variants, with a few exceptions, and then there's a grand total of four melee weapons. Rather pitiful compared to what's on offer in Darktide.

So, what about PvP? It feels totally slapped on to me. Melee has way less of an impact than I'd expect in a *Warhammer* game, the TTK is stupidly fast for what are supposed to be impressively durable supersoldiers, and I've (I'm NOT exaggerating) not played a single match that wasn't absurdly one-sided.

To me it feels as if they created the 6 - 10 hour ish campaign and then realized that releasing a shooter exclusively comprised of that doesn't exactly fly in the 2024 market for the price of $60; so what did they do? They cooked up a half-arsed PvP mode and a co-op PvE experience with an obnoxious progression system in the hopes of artificially extending playtime and creating the illusion of value. There's only minor enemy placement differences on each replay and no semblance of an AI director so content runs dry quick.

Sounds familiar, actually. A lot like World War Z by the same studio.

That value just isn't there for me, personally. I would pay maybe $30 just to experience the campaign which is visually breathtaking and full of cool moments, both narratively, and from the perspective of sheer rule of cool. But everything else? it's just mid, I think.

Frankly, I don't understand why Darktide was so lambasted for its launch when this game suffers from the same issues of a lack of content, poor optimization and crappy weapons that take forever to tune and actually feel solid. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I really can't find the appeal.",2024/9/15,en

Do not mislead yourself, money for the purchase of this game go to killers!

This game has been bought either candid colaboration macarons, or ""Kakaya Raznnitsa"", that is, the Little Russia, or those who do not care very much for the news of Gaemdev and still do not know some information.
This is probably the latter are not yet hopeless and the inspection is designed.

Community Created Artwork for Steam Artwork
By: Dyztop

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 was made by developers from Peter, so those whose relatives are now killing Ukrainians, those who now pay money for the needs of war criminals, those who are now flipping through the news and abusing another shelling of Ukrainian cities.And of course, those who directly help their army in the invading war, such as adjusting equipment, databases, sites, or actively spreading Kremlin propaganda.
Well

It should be noted separately that the developers themselves are hypocritically and cowardly hide where they come from.On any game resources of the segment of the segment there are all the news and comments to them in the spirit of ""Oghi -giggles have shaken the same !! 1"".Well, everyone knows everything, but they are officially hidden by the mask like an American company.Although Saber Interactive is a marsh company.About this a lot of information.
You can see more about the developers here:

Now about Focus Entertainment publisher.This publisher actively supports both information and money with many marsh companies.Yes, they gave out a Fart atom and a variety of Warhammer's trash 40,000: Space Marine 2 and others.It was in the fall of 2022 that they apologized to the rashists, it is not a joke, they really placed a post with aqua freshe and apologies, and this is exactly when they began to shoot cities in Ukraine massively.Imagine the level of cynicism!
You can hear about the publisher in this video:

So the conclusion is simple, do not buy all Saber Interactive games and preferably Focus Entertainment publisher, but it is more difficult with the publisher, because there are developers who have supported Ukraine, for example, developers A Plaague Tale: Requiem.
Also, I additionally provide information about the developer in text:



Do not buy this game, The Developer Is Located in the Russian Federation, in the City of St.Petersburg and Actively Supports War, Mass Murder, Shelling Of Cities, Kidnaping of Children, Rape, Etc.
Every Dollar from Sales of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is the Death of Another Peaceful Ukrainian.

One of the most fun I've had, I'd dare say the best 40k game to date (makes me want an Imperial Guard game by these guys). A complete package of PvE and PvP with all future content free. The season pass only holding cosmetics. No pesky microtransactions, time savers, or any other games as service BS. The devs listening and bringing updates and changes upon what the audience as a whole seem to resonate with is also a breath of fresh air.

The fact the game can still be played in ""offline"" mode is a godsend in itself and a rarity for many a-game in 2024.

My only real complaints are things that can be changed & fixed with time. The bugs in the experience (I've had a few crashes).
The other is the lack of customization for the Chaos Space Marines minus paints and decals. I do see segments for pre-built armor sets, but who knows, maybe they'll open customization to it in the future if the game continues move forward.

I've clocked 14hrs on normal difficulty and skipped half the side missions. I'd say 16-17hrs max on normal. This is an AWESOME game. Masculinity incarnate. Ticks all the boxes. Brotherhood, a calling for a higher purpose, good vs evil. This is a blokes game. It will tickle every masculine atom in your body. That's not to say females wont enjoy this game, you will, it just means you're an ultimate badass.

You don't have to be a lore expert here. I myself am a casual warhammer fan. I just know the basics. And you can too, there are many 1 hour videos on youtube that will read you the basics, and get you up to snuff. Watch one of those and your done.

But here's the gist.

Play as a 7ft tall superhuman soldier, a space marine, created by the Emperor himself. It's a grim dystopian future, humanity is in a constant galactic war for it's very survival. A galactic war that has no end. A war that has raged for tens of thousands of years. A war against Elves, Orcs, Machine races, Tyranids (think Alien xenomoprhs), And traitor humans and demons from the realm of chaos (basically a dimension that originally harboured souls of the dead, but became overwhelmed by constant war and death in the galaxy that it is now a twisted dimension of chaos and evil) a dimension that leaks into ours, twisting and corrupting everything it touches.

You don't have to play the first game, but I absolutely advise it. There a more than a few references to it. It's a great game. This series is gonna be huge. So don't starve yourself of any backstory.

As for the gameplay, I suggest playing on normal, any higher and you lose that power fantasy feel and becomes kind of a chore to play. The level design is incredible, better than anything today, seeing the armies of humanity fighting this endless war in the background is incredible, tanks and apc's rolling around, it's so much fun to just watch. You'll really feel like you're playing an important role in this war. It will feel like it's unfolding in front of you. And the downtime on the ship in between mission is just icing on the cake.

It's expensive. But we need to support devs that remember what gaming is about. Appealing to their audience. Not mass appeal and micro transactions.

So, grab you're weapon brother, and get into the fray.

- At the time of writing the review, the game has those problems and jambs of optimization (I personally had everything great, but my friends have no)
- there are problems of the network component, sometimes there is an incredibly long connection in which you simply boils and the customization settings are poorly preserved (they fly out to be banal from time to time)
- Price.Like a fan, of course I appreciated all the content that I was offered, but 3K is still a bit too much for the game in which content (without DLS and rechecies) is not so much.But this is recovered by the reigree and interest of the missions/operations themselves.In addition, the developers plan to introduce such additions and missions in the future, which encourages to continue to play this PROKK.
On this, the disadvantages ended for me personally, this is an excellent comprehensive adventure both on one person and a joint batch with 2 faithful friends!Operations on high difficulties abandon a good challenge, and PVP mode can slightly diversify the game.The guard also paid a lot of attention, the fans will clearly appreciate this, it is clear that the guys made the game with love and efforts, so special thanks to the developers for the full Russian voice acting, you are the best guys!And the feeling of infinity of opponents makes you believe in the inevitability of defeat and plunges into the world in full (unless there is not enough bestiaria and similar things, for those who do not fumble for the world of the 40th millennium)

It's just fantastic!What titanic work was the developers put on cards, armor, weapons.Just bravo!At some eye levels, it is difficult to tear off from the local beauties!Very beautiful graphics and most importantly everything is optimized (literally, from the very early access)!
And in customization of cosmodes you can abyss with your head.

You balance between your neighbor and a long battle, you dodge, parry and finish very colorfully.
It’s just that everything is thoughtlessly crumbling on the right and it will not work on the left, but it does not turn into hardcore tactics either.It turned out something average, what is needed in order to believe in what is happening and feel the power of cosmodes.

The story was satisfactory, far from perfect, the visuals are fantastic there are indeed moments of awe.. but by and large those appear to be smoke and mirrors.

Even with the souls like punishing combat systems... yes, you play a space marine and spend most of your time pretending to be a rolling pill bug. Hiding behind corners, but only right hand corners as you cannot shoulder swap, or going into melee to parry, parry, parry, dodge, parry.. unless you like getting stun locked or shot while almost to your feet during the standing animation.

I do not recommend this game and here is why:
- it feels bad to shoot any weapon other than melta or charged plasma because they deal no damage, it takes more than a clip from any bolt weapon to throw any medium unit into executable state (way way too long), enemies shrug 30-40 direct hits from HEAVY BOLTER like it was a toy gun
- melee is not fun, you get stagger locked and killed by medium enemies
- it feels bad to use chainsword (thunderhammer and power sword feels better but they are not available on 4/6 of operation classes), you cut down the small enemies, but fighting any medium+ is not fun - they will either dodge or play red or blue with you.
- medium+ enemies in melee stagger you with every hit, but your attacks do not
- enemies like to play with you in red and blue, dodge or parry, do it wrong and you lose 50%-75% of health
- enemies are able to teleport or dodge like 10 meters, your dodge is like 1m
- health and armor system is very badly implemented - SM1 had it much better. You cannot recover health with finishers, only armor, yet you lose armor almost instantly. To do a finisher on enemy you need to hit it real good to recover like 1 armor segment.

It is just not fun to play right now.
I do not want to play a class in operations for 10h before it feels fun to play, I want it to feel good from start and then just get better. Most people will play an operation or two, see it is not fun and leave.

Good things:


- The graphics are 10, I repeat myself, it looks like a movie.

- Absolute fidelity to the franchise

- Jeatage and mechanics


Bad:

- There is a loss of frames and a high CPU use that will be corrected in patches, so it is not a problem.

- The colors of the Pintaejercitos should be free.I can't create my chapter because the blue I need is DLC.I think the only payment should be cosmetic at the armor level without restricting colors.

- Some colors are not well painted according to areas because the tone does not match the color.

- DLC ranges.To create lieutenants and veteran sergeants you also need the DLC pattern and do not seem fair either.(I will buy the DLC later anyway)



Things I would put in the multiplayer:


- That when you personalize your sailor the colors applied are also applied to the rest of the entire fleet so that if you have your own chapter you feel that immersion.

- The PVP mode should also have a PVE from my point of view because I and all my friends are PVE players.(This is not necessary but there would be more casual people who simply want to have a good time with their friends)

H3X,0,66.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/-H3X-/,"Went into this expecting to be playing a game.
At this point it's not a game, it's a chore and I'm disappointed.

The world, setting, etc are all really nice. It's oddly relatively well performing too which is more than can be said for a lot of bigger games in the last five years.

But, it's busted. The enemy AI targets only the player, doesn't take into account the player mechanics - so you're more than likely to end up between getting hit and getting hit, because if you deign it necessary to block, dodge or parry you are also allowing something else to do their thing because they basically ignore the rest of the squad. This extends out of the campaign to bots in the Operations mode, so there's no respite from awful mechanical failure there either. Never mind the minibosses that stunlock you because you miss a dodge and because of recovery animation just wail on you from 100% to 0 with no way to escape due to how the attack chains are set up. Or the lack of indicator on 90% of parry-possible attacks, or the lack of any form of recovery outside of what would be UT99's worst healing pack in a game that a basic mob can stunlock the protagonist. Ugh.

It feels like an attempt to implement an Arkham style riposte system, but it doesn't work when everything you do with it leaves you open to more damage. Why even use it at that point. Stop targeting only the damned player to the point it's not playable. Please.

EDIT:
After more playtime, some time in multiplayer and practice with the game systems;
Still not sure I want to recommend this.

Multiplayer routinely has connection/stability issues which are not PC/ISP connection related from what I've seen, and the combat whilst satisfying at times still has the issues with stunlock etc.

AI squad members (which you unfortunately see often) are also worse than I initially thought in both campaign and online, having no capability to follow directions (such as attack/defend) featured as part of the main UI, no perks in Operations, no proper target priority when picking one out, no damage against actual boss tier enemies, and more. About the only thing they can do properly is fire a weapon at mobs and recover their own health outside of combat, leaving everything for the player(s) to do which can be borderline impossible. They routinely ruin Operations runs for example.

This game has a single player tag on Steam, but truthfully is not one. If you would buy it as a single player game, look into the solo gameplay in existing videos or streams first as it's a bit deceiving to say it truly is a single player title.

I was a big fan of the first Space Marine, contrary to the negative reviews it was hailing at the time!In this respect, my joy was that there is a sequel very high!Unfortunately, I can't do this game a good rating!
It is neither due to the technology nor the atmosphere, that is so far and optically makes something really.The lighting, the huge swarms, the backdrop, everything very chic ... but ...

In my opinion, this game weakens on the combat system, and when it should be an action game ...
The entire fight simply looks extremely ""spongy"".You beat like wild, without any meaning and mind.Hits hailed from all sides so that man at times cannot do anything else except to permanently spam the spacebar.At no time you have the feeling that you somehow really influence the fight whether you play well or bad!There is one goal after the other and there is actually nothing you could do about it.Occasionally, if you notice it all over the bustle, you can knock out a block.Here the whole thing also looks massive, but it goes down completely in all the confusion.
I played it on heavy and easy, and completely sausage whether you are doing well or bad ... somehow you can get through!This does not require any skills or sophistication, but is a simple key hammer!

In the first part there was also a lot going on on the battlefields, but if I timed my attacks and finisher well, I had an impact on how the fight developed!I fought quickly, used narcotic strokes I was able to exist for longer in battle and ultimately decide the fight for me!

It doesn't matter how I fight, I collect the hits one way or another, then there is a counterattack every few seconds and a finisher that is wearing out extremely quickly.These counterattacks are also the only thing you really have in your hand.95% of the hits you still collect whether you skillfully avoid or not and in the end you come through the fight without actually knowing how!

The fights are simply too confusing and you just get away wildly with always and always ...... and always the same blunt attacks!If you face a bigger opponent, you will be hit by hormagants from behind hundred times that simply ""stick"" to your figure.
The blows are extremely imprecise and too often go to nothing.The navy simply trudge cumbersome and knocks out the same combo after the other.",2024/9/11,de

You can give a plus point in this attitude. After all, the officials2 official will not care about the player experience.

Great Cinematic experience, better with friends, very cool.
Only low point I can think of are the ""Rats"" section of the 2nd mission and some downtime sections from the ""Cave"" mission.

PvP:
It's ok, a bit death-bally and significantly less emphasis on Melee in my short experience with it.
I didn't have much interest in it before and quickly lost interest in it, so I haven't played a lot of rounds nor grind each classes to unlock their other, more interesting weapons.

(Co-)Operations:

Patch 3.0 (2024/09/26) update:

Armor attrition vs Minoris is better which made the melee combat survivability less punishing or gunstrike reliant. Adjusted spawns for the Chaos faction nerfs made it less overwhelming.

Overall an improvement to the push forward combat that plays better and makes you feel more like a Space Marine, but also makes the game easier (which I think is alright as they will add new enemies and difficulty tier).

They also fixed the bugs with the Supply pod full healing characters with +20% max HP passive/ perk and healing past contested health bug with Melta/ Las Fusil/ etc. which is good.

Original Launch review:

Only having 6 missions on launch is terrible, -Tide games and World War Z had more on launch in the past and still needed more content.

Balance seemed all over the place.
At the higher difficulties, there are fewer resources, it felt similar to the tactical survival experience of Back 4 Blood and World War Z. Depending on your build, you want to be thrifty with ammo and to save it for a wave/ Terminus miniboss/ or an enemy calling for reinforcements from an out of reach place.

Enemies becomes bullet spongy at higher difficulties and are more numerous, and Medicae Stims heals less HP. Different weapon types seem to have different effectiveness vs specific enemies. Running away to the next airlock/ elevator to despawn enemies behind you is cheesy and effective, but not fun.

You have to ration your ammo in-between fixed ammo crate placements and try to use melee, the environment, and equipment you find as optimally as possible (explosive barrels, explosive flowers, and level gimmicks such as the fire wall at the end of the first mission or the train diverter control panel in the last mission).

Regardless of the difficulty, missions have RNG aspects to it such as the mid-level events requiring 0-6 (!) sub-objectives to complete.

Perk and class balance seemed to be all over the place, but I need to play more to be sure, and there seems to be some bugs or hidden effects.
Examples for balance stuff:
- Certain classes have ammo generation perks later on in their class (or weapon perk line) which seems to be a mandatory pick compared to the other options;
- Bulwark's 23 perk restores contested health to your max HP which substantially reduces the need for healing items when paired with executions, or allowing full heal + wound restoration when paired with a Medicae Stim.

Also you use the same currency to buy weapons, class perks, and Space Marine Chapter Customization and you always feel poor while progressing initially, with some classes having more expensive weapons (e.g. Assault).

You also need to grind each class and weapons types. You can max out a class to level 25 and still need to level other weapon types, but trying to do it in the higher difficulty sucks because your lower tier weapon is weak, negatively affecting the strength of the team and your character.",2024/9/7,en

Already, positive points:
-It's super beautiful, graphically it's impeccable and the artistic style fits perfectly with Warhammer 40K.
-The history, although sitting simple (as is often the case in Warhammer) flows fluidly and we let ourselves be caught.
-Super technical condition, in 4 hours of play I met only one bug: the IA colleagues who sparently grenades in the elevator, and still it did not last long.

I went around, yes it was short, now the angry things:
To put it simply: take ""Space Marine 1"", remove everything that made the game fun and you have ""Space Marine 2"".

-We go from 4 weapons equipped to only 2, which considerably reduces gameplay possibilities and poses a big problem on the management of ammunition (all the time short).
-The armor system supposed to protect your life bar does not work.Each armor bar takes only 1 stroke (and you only have 2), so since you're constantly facing 50 critters both that you can say that the armor will not be active very often.
-The system to recover from life is frankly darker: no more executions that allow you to regenerate your HP, now it makes 1 armor bar (see the previous point to understand why it does not work well), you can only recoverSome of the last damage suffered and only with hand and body ... making all the fight at a distance completely useless since you can only lose.
So, they put care objects well ... Finally I believe, they shine so much by their absence that I spent the first 3 hours of play asking me if they really existed.
-speaking of weapons from a distance: they are all pissed off.Without messing around, who replaced the bolter with a plastic nerve?!Even by emptying a whole charger (25 shots) right in the face of a single mob other than the small shit that crawl on the ground ... you don't kill it!Weapons do miserable damage and it completely breaks the ""Badass"" side that comes with playing a Space-Marine.I play a super-soldier of 3 meters fifty that makes the ground tremble when it walks ... and I fight with a weapon that pulls dry prunes, pay your anticlimatism> <
-The alterations of random effect that prevent you from playing, like the poison which makes blind or the effect of confusion which makes you lose control of your character, etc ...

Combines all this at the same time ... and you can just not play: between the random alterations that completely prohibit you from doing anything, half of the enemies that get your lifebar from a distance (life bar that youCan not regen given the almost permanent absence of care objects and the gameplay problems mentioned above) and the fact that you can not kill enemies for lack of damage and you have the perfect combo of the anti-game.
Space Marine 1 was a hack'n slash stuffed with testosterone or you had fun in the middle of an ork tide ...
Space Marine 2 is a punishment in which you desperately try to have fun in the face of a system designed to ruin you the pleasure of play.

Sold for 60 euros, I call it a scam.

Edit: in low difficulty mode, the game is super nice and I took a lot of fun ... But the story becomes very short, and the defects of game-design and balancing that I describedHere continue, even if they are much more discreet.

- Catcans and panoramas are well -haired, atmospheric and epic.
- The actors of the voice acting tried well.The voice acting is high -quality, even though they did not guess with the sound of a bolter.

Cons:
- Too short for your price tag.In eleven hours, you will slowly pass the campaign and all the PVE mission.
- Grind in Leitheim - for pumping one class, a couple of dozen passes of PVE missions will be required, which after Patch 4.0 are only seven.
- The crumpled presentation of the plot in the campaign.Due to the brevity of dialogs and insufficient exposure, the behavior of two hundred-year-old men looks like children's tangrums.
- Disgusting balance - most of the weapons are extremely ineffective, two -thirds of the perks are useless, half of the classes are very inferior to the other in effectiveness.
- Periodically in PVE there are discosnexes without the ability to reconnect.Go to almost the entire mission and fly out at the end without a reward is not very pleasant.
- The developer team does not know how to balance Horde Pve, but decisively applies global changes.In addition to the new PVE mission in Patch 4.0, there is literally nothing good.There are even fewer cartridges, CP is even more enemies, bolters and nearby battle are even more useless.

A little word for experts and rageous of Bad Reviews (Negative Evaluation):

Before posting checking your PCs and letting the possibility give you help for your worries by activating the comments.

This game requires an advanced configuration, forget the minimum configuration, an SSD, and a PC with at least simmilar values ​​to that of optimal recomandation.
If despite this you still have problems, you will have to look elsewhere, for example via your task management to make what takes a lot of resources on your machine, see if all your drive is up to date etc ...
What I can say informative, the game works super well, fluid, no crash, configure as much as possible at the graphic level without loss of performance and I have a lot of free resources on my machine.

The configuration of the BIOS by the Mother Card Manufacturer for the last generation processors are often the cause of many problems on the new PCs (known at MSI and Asus, but others too).
An update of BIOS or adjustment of those if necessary to reduce overheating and planting of your PCs or to stabilize your processors.(receipt on processors 14th generation)

In your Setting of the Game Favor FSDR2 and not the DLSS, having a screen with high hertzian frecquence is no longer a luxury for the last game generation.",2024/9/6,fr

SeiEhrlich,1,36.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052283558/,"Introduction
Space Marine 2 - exciting, saturated and, most importantly for me, not a protracted adventure
both for one player and for the company of friends, because you can go through the trip.There are three types of content in the game:
The campaign is the story of Titus and its two comrades;
Operations - additional tasks that tell about the adventures of other members of the detachment, simultaneously performing their tasks.There is a pumping of equipment and classes, but I don't think,
That this can directly tighten, unless the combat system has sunk into your soul, but at least all the missions are worth passing once.
The eternal war is a multiplayer against other players, where 6 by 6 hard workers fight against each other.Honestly, I didn’t really like it, because I am not a fan of PVP content, but I do not exclude that someone likes it.

The game is an action from a third person with distortion into a near battle, as the damage
From long -range weapons, on average, below, but you should not forget about it, because not every enemy will run away with a headlong.
In close combat, you have to realize simple combinations of blows and fend off,
But do not worry, here you are not games and the attack will kindly illuminate and give enough time to the reaction.Also, enemies do not hesitate to use strong attacks that are not parked,
But you can dodge them, however, where you could fend the enemy at any time of the animation of the attack of your character, then you can dodge, as if only after the animation ended, which caused me problems.
It is possible to treat our cosmomoriac, unlike the first part, you can first first -aid kit or manage to make up for lost health in a short period of time by beating the enemy in the manner of the Bloodborne game.

The graphics in the game were admired, as well as the design of levels made with love for the universe.Many details in the animation of the characters, finishing enemies, covering armor with blood and dirt are a direct delight.The sensation of blows and firing is handed over well, as well as work with the sounds of weapons is done great, but, unfortunately, the enemies are felt, sometimes like lips for damage, which destroys immersion in the role of the strongest soldiers of the emperor.

Honestly, it’s hard for me to say, because I do not have advanced iron, but on RTX 2070, Ryzen 5 3600, 16 GB of RAM with a frequency of 3200 MHz I received ~ 45 frames in saturated bloody battles on Full HD monitor with medium graphics settings and dlss includedIn balance.
In general, it suited me and played it, quite, normal, taking into account the general quality of the picture.

First of all, I want to take the work of servers here.Their work for me remains a mystery.In operations
With random people, I received a ping of European servers, which was quite happy, but passing the campaign with a friend that lives near me, I could get as much as 600, which cited me
In a stupor.So because of this, the sound path in the cats could lag behind.Most likely, this problem was solved, but I ran into her and I cannot but mention.

The pumping in operations, in my opinion, is tightened, because in addition to pumping the class, it is necessary to pump each type of weapon separately, which is exhausted, but the weapon is divided into 4 classes of rarity and you cannot so calmly go through the maximum difficulty having the first or second rarity in the equipment of the character.

Summarizing, I want to say that the game is definitely worth playing in it, even if you are not a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe.In my opinion, you can get a unique experience that is not comparable with other games, except that only a DOOM series of games comes to mind, but this is different a bit.",2024/11/28,ru

There will be a TL;DR at the end.

~

The game falls short of its own shadow in many ways.
It is without character development and story
It is without the variety.
It is with a less consistent/polished core loop.

The testosterone filled glory of the combat swells the brain with glee, but dulls after a few hours.

- Controls Are Awkward - KBM is trash, you’ll need a gamepad, although it’s not much better. You never really get used to it.
- Multiplayer Focus - In case you’re here for the campaign.
- - Repetitive, but not bad,
- Not 40k Faithful - Boltguns tickle enemies, Chew Through rare enemies, blasphemous plot, etc.
- Surprise! - It wants to be a Live Service game.
- Unfinished Grenade UI - they seem the same on HUD ?
- Gun Execute is Blah - at the beginning is super cool;not punchy enough, you end up chaining them together over and over to kill 1 guy.
- Ammo? - It is not precious, but it's also not plentiful.
- FOV - way too shallow
- ""Hold to interact"" - ew.
- Buggy - Including enemies shooting through walls, not picking up items, clipping, and more.
- Missing Features - Can’t snap to targets. Needed for controller.
- No squad customization - ???
- No Troop Variety - Never fight beside mechanical troopers or mercs. Sad.
- None of the little soldiers ever survive - :(
- Campaign Overstays Welcome - It's a 5-6 hour experience in an 8-9 hour package.
- Very Stingy on healing - Awkward unlike other games in the medium.

- Bullet Sponge Enemies - Dump 3 clips of bolter ammo into a normal guy’s head.
- Stun Locks - Get messed up and tossed around sometimes.
- Antithetical Dance - Combat stutters and fails to flow.
- No Upgrades in Campaign - All the cools stuff is in Multiplayer.
- Lack Of Mechanical Depth - Tastes like a cake missing ingredients
- Sound is off - voice is especially low.
- Flat characters - Unsurprising and uninteresting.
- No collectables - ????!?
- Health Sponge - Armor is fickle, and your health is constantly chipped down with few ways to earn it back.
- AI allies are goofy - and enemies disregard them.
- Invasive ""Always Online"" BS - Makes it harder to enjoy at times.
- NDA and Information Harvesting - I don’t usually have to sell my soul to play a game.
- Was that my gun? - Non-dynamic weapon models for cutscenes. C’MON IT’S 2024!
- Pinning animations are too long - repeating several times.
- Bosses are boring bullet sponges - Not mechanically challenging, just take forever.
- No Controller Presets where swapping weapons is NOT on the D-Pad - You will be doing this constantly
- Weapons don't feel like wins - they all feel like losers in some way.
- Pathetic weapon variety - They look drab and insultingly similar, they play the same.
- Bosses are normal enemies? - For some they just slap a big healthbar on a normal Elite enemy and recycle others.
- Neutral melee attacks… - cause your character to turn around and not attack where you're facing.

- Solid flow - fans rejoice!
- 2010's goodness - Simplicity!
- throwback - ""Cooridor Shooter"" vibes in a good way.
- Great Enemies! - Tyanid/Zerg foes are super fun to blast away at!
- Looks gorgeous - Pleasing to the senses!
- Music can be inspiring! - Swelling overtones!
- Juicy - Tons of executions and combat punch
- Guns sound powerful! - Even if they don’t do much, you feel like a beast
- Fun with Friends! - Everything is, but this is a good experience to share!
- Satisfying Destruction! - My therapist recommends this.
- Lots of cool locations! - No longer stuck on the machine world of !
- Nerds Rejoice! - Lots of little goodies for 40k fans!
- Lots of variety! - Modes, Modes, MODES! Throwback to 2009 with how much content!

is fun for a time. It’s novel for 40k fans who will enjoy the tropes, much like many star wars folks these days. Hyper dramatic combat loop dazzles at first and fizzles without variety, but keeps you engaged to get your money’s worth. Made me want to read the books, had novel vibes at times in a good way. It's more of the original Space Marine 1 without too much added, and that’s good in and of itself. The game has a AAA look and a mid-range feel; while suffering from the issue of having lots of enemies to kill and not enough resources to do so efficiently.

Brother AWAS,0,146.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198103479992/,"TLDR - The game is great but the initial experience during the early access was atrocious for co-op. I highly recommend it now but I can't leave a thumbs up for paying to play a Beta test for their co-op servers. Co-op was advertised ages ago, it should've worked for everyone in all regions.

My initial experience before the server maintenance:-
Get yer damn co-op servers running. We can barely play together dangit. It has bee 6 hours of being in game, half that time was either me looking at ""Joining server"" or my friend experiencing the same. And when we do play... it's not so bad. Game's pretty fun. But hot damn get the servers workin.

Another 7ish hours later and the co-op servers still suck.
Tried all the possible fixes on the internet and still nothing.
This game was advertised to having co-op so you'd expect to have it on the get go.

After the server maintenance:-
The co-op finally works.
No work around, no fiddling with the settings, just share your code and there's your friend in the lobby. The squad works in all game modes. I'm having fun and I'm enjoying everything the game has to offer and am excited to see what comes next on the road map.

If you wanna know more about the game itself check out the other reviews cause they can probably do a better job explaining it.

With all that said, first impressions count and that initial roller coaster of nothingness still has a lingering impact. We were told we could play the game early if we bought it early. Apparently, that only applied to certain people and in certain regions. Some people got their moneys worth while others didn't. As much as I want to leave a thumbs up for the game, I can't.

“You're a lieutenant now.”Is this a problem?



🟢 What I liked

✅ Cooperative.He probably makes this game in many ways.Without him, it would be much more boring.I played a coop with two friends.

✅ Crowds of enemies.Crowds of enemies are felt and look gorgeous.Not that in Serious Sam 4 with his legion system, which was seen once in the entire game.Here the crowds are straight seamless.Flying only stand out.And in the end, if you allow a crowd of enemies to you, there will be a really crowd of enemies around you.)

✅.Atmospheric decor.Pretty static.Of the interactions with him, there is only the destruction of the boxes, the activation of inflaments and dialogs with the background characters, but ... this time it worked.Perhaps, in conjunction with crowds of enemies and high -quality art - it worked and went straight to me.

✅.It is a little interest for me as a fight for me.There was a lot of firing much more pleasant.The close battle is not read very much.But then the animations are cool and the weight of the cosmodes is felt.So for the ""wig"" roles with friends in the coop is very tolerable.

✅.As I wrote above, this game has a very high -quality art.It is interesting to consider locations.Despite the fact that events seem to be localized not far from each other - the scenery is always different and there is a contrast between them.

✅.The game is quite good.The dialogs are plausible, in the spirit of Wahi 40k.All this is served with high -quality katsen, which are sometimes even interactive.

🔴

❌.Permanent discos with a servak ​​darmed.

❌.Enemies sometimes ignore shelters and throw through them in long battle.

❌.Sometimes the game for some reason takes me cool guns that I found in the campaign.And it gives out something stock, such as a conventional bolter.

❌.It was not enough for me very much.On high difficulty on arenas you often die or allies.And sooner or later, in one of the arenas, the number of revival will end.And you have to replay from the control point.As if between the arenas, after the battle, it is necessary to regenerate these rebirths.",2024/9/21,ru
Hikarian,0,3.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mehendre/,"In principle a good game, but I just can't support laziness with a clear conscience.But what does that mean?

Graphically, the game is very good, but no masterpiece but you consider how many opponents are involved at the same time.I play on 4K with a 7900xtx and an alienware Oled Monitor.Everything on Max and you have optimized between 40-80 fps very well.Unfortunately no HDR support.

The story is total nonsense if you know your way around the lore, the whole planet should be full of Space Marines so that you have a chance at all, but it's good a game that is also ok.

Where does laziness come into play?In the combat system, actually that could be a horny shooter, but the developers force a mix of close combat and ranged so I have no problem Darkide did it very well.

But here this is extremely poorly implemented, you only get on the mouth because you are constantly surrounded. The game is building on the fact that you can endure what bothers me is that the opponents AI especially and explicitly attack the player, big opponents likeThe Carnifex can block ranged attacks completely, with 2 swords yes it is clear.Higher levels of difficulty are totally lame made simply opponent has more HP and makes more damage.In the melee attacks you thought if you installed the blows more, but it was totally forceful after every hit, but apparently I am the only one who bothers.Ranged fighters always hit you when you don't actively avoid, so only stay in motion doesn't really help.

In principle, it is WWZ in the Warhammer Universum The Tyranids even climb exactly as the zombies up where.

I think if you play that in the Coop with real people, it's certainly funny but with bots the weaknesses just stand out.If you couldn't play a spacemarine here, but that there would be any other setting I can well imagine that the game would also have flopped.

Objectively, Darktide would be the better game if Fattshark lets itself down to install a campaign or to do anything with the story.

Conclusion: You can treat yourself to if the money is scarce for a sale that will certainly not take long before Christmas.It is a good game that does not do justice to the hype.You could have really got more out of the combat system.",2024/9/7,de

+ Truly an epic campaign
+ Looks great
+ Gameplay is solid, brutal, bloody and gives a good challenge on higher difficulties
+ Soundtrack
+ 6 unique classes for PVE and PVP

+ Polished, no bugs ( except Tyranids )


- No Chaos customization in multiplayer, you can only changes their color not a single piece of armor
- Only 3 maps for multiplayer... truly a heresy
- 3 multiplayer modes aren't much better... Team Deatmatch, Capture point and Mobile Capture Point. Truly nothing special.
- For me game takes literally few minutes to quit... faster is just to press ALT+F4
- Though 6 PVE scenarios that we curently have are pretty good, on longer run they will lack replayability

The sequel to the TPS Shooting Game Space Marine in the Warhammer worldview

I don't remember any memories because it's old, but there is an image that has been quite fun.

In anticipation of the Gold Edition, I played the Gold Edition and played the 4th on the 4th with Advanced Access.



After sweeping the opening videos and the crowded juggling enemies

Expectations for the game have risen, but the expectation did not last long.



There are quite a few things to see with a fairly large planet scale battle and directing.

The configuration of the stage itself is strongly given the feeling of the battle -battle -moving -battle

There are very few additional elements such as the growth factors and skill acquisition of the characters according to the progress

Core gameplay is quite dependent and lacks in depth.

The lack of many types of enemies or impressive bosses accelerates this feeling.



Skills or weapons level ups that would have been good to be in the campaign exists in PVE mode.

There are only six PVE missions, and except for the difficulty stage

It's hard to find motivation or fun to play repeatedly.



Still, the gameplay itself is satisfying the fun of the basic TPS shooting game

It may be fun to break the campaign + PVE mission once

In these days, full price (list price of 79800 won, 4 days to do 104800 won)

Finzy,1,22.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyfinzy/,"Basing this off of the singleplayer campaign, I'd give this game a neutral review if I could, I enjoyed some parts of it and some parts not so much. First off the game does look and sound amazing and does Warhammer 40,000 every bit of justice it possibly can, there's tons of detail everywhere and the environments and scale of the enemy hordes are seriously impressive. And it's not just a cosmetics thing, you can see the swarms climbing walls and such and you can destroy them. The basic combat once you get used to the parry and dodge system works pretty well and the weapons feel like they all have a use; I tried to use most of the weapons I picked up during my playthrough and there were few straight up upgrades, more like sidegrades.

The structure of the missions is very linear and there's generally very few things to find apart from audio logs. At the start of the game it felt like you got obstructed very often, I kept walking into invisible walls, but I think the game opens up later on more and the midway part of the campaign had the best mission variety. Sadly I think the campaign falls off towards the end, but other than that, I mostly had a good time. I wish the jetpacks would have been used more in missions.

Now onto the things I didn't like; the whole campaign seems designed more for co-op play than singleplayer. The AI teammates are generally very bad at covering you while doing objectives (+ they cannot do objectives themselves), and you'll regularily get pinned down by ranged enemies all the time, so in every encounter you have to hyperfocus the ranged enemies down first because the AI won't be doing that. At first I started the campaign on Veteran difficulty and I found it to be too annoying to complete with the AI so I switched to Normal after a couple missions and had a much better time. But still the squad AI could really be better, the game should offer a more balanced singleplayer experience. (EDIT: This was improved in patches which is good!)

Also (potential spoilers warning), the campaign isn't very long, I finished it in just about 11 hours, while generally taking my sweet time to explore as well. Towards the end it's like they forgot the beginning of the invasion (Tyranids) completely and the ending felt very cliche and Disney like. I did like that they introduced more enemies later on and I'm a fan of different than usual Chaos factions being represented but it felt like there should have been more story missions across all the planets. I know there's the Operations mode and Eternal War, and I expect that'll add a lot more playtime, but the main campaign felt quite short. (EDIT - Operations has been quite fun if a bit grindy, Eternal War is a pretty typical pvp mode and could use more interesting maps and customization imo)

The game ran well on my laptop with an i9 13980 HX, 32 GB RAM and Nvidia 4090 RTX 16 GB; on 2560x1600 resolution I could play it on high settings with ultra textures (without any upscaling), getting between 60-80 FPS. Some of the larger fights dipped as low as 50 but not below that. I'll probably test how it runs at 4K later on but I'd expect it to require some DLSS at least.

I didn't like that the game has no support for aspect ratios other than 16:9, so at 16:10 I had constant black bars on my screen all the time and it should really be fixed as it's a standard feature in PC games. Also, there was no support for inverted horizontal camera controls for gamepad, so I couldn't play it on gamepad since I use fully inverted controls (both vertical + horizontal) in all games I play; another thing that should be fixed and added to options. Had to learn to play on keyboard & mouse instead :p

TL;DR:
Solid gameplay; nice WH40K aesthetic; poor AI and mission design more for co-op; short campaign that falls off towards the end; some annoying missing technical features",2024/9/8,en

-Enemies are bulllet sponges and Bolts (That are Mini-Rockets with high armorpiering potention) feels like .22LR on high difficualties cause enemy HP got x4 modifiers but many bolt weapon had only 2-2.5 DMG that just a joke
-Zoantopes became just flying fortreses that can instanly kill you even if you dodge it in right timing. And don't even try to take cover from beam devs think it's good idea to make them go through any obsticale.
-Chaos is just BORING. Fight against ranged enemies with pea-shooter while yjey use .50BMG with Inferno modifiers. This is just a bad joke.

Why is the assessment of negative. All, it is simply impossible to give a neutral assessment or well silt is bad.
But it is neutral.
What I liked in the game.
-Dear shooter, good shooting.
-Disy finishing and juicy meat (if you understand what I mean). Also, chaosites are good, although many complain that they are conflicting in them. Re -read the ENT thousands or look and everything will be engaged in itself. They have more meat in the form of heretics and ordinary peoplexenos.
-Det sound and music.
-Paphos company for all covenants of Warhammer 40,000. Continuing overcoming ""Captain Titki of the Order of Supovars with a toilet theme.""
Continuation of the service of the cosmessor Dymmetry Titus in the name of the possessor and his Order of Cosmodesant Ultramarinov.Rubikon's tires and elevation to primaryis, etc.
-The painful environment and immersion in the gloomy world of the universe.
-The good mission of the mission complementing the plot after the silt during the passage of the main company.
Well, for me, everything is pleasant for me.
And that is why this review is still neutral-negative (or neutral).
-This content that is in the game can be passed in 30 hours. At the maximum complexity, if you run to the minimum.
-Ity PVP and balance in it. Seriously cards and modes, the cat cried.
-Balance of weapons, well, Christmas trees of sticks, bolter weapons are, likely, microopracts (micro and a small aoya should be like me and the number of bolts in the head 2-3 for a special purpose).I need to put 20 bolts in the head of chaosite so that it falls into the knockout. At the 5th complexity, this nichrome is not ridiculous. Moreover, he feels a cheat Bree and Hevy Bolt Gan. (Well, we don’t take a crooked weapon from the GP).Normally bolt weapons are played with a soldier with teranids becauseThrough the ausospesx perk there is a backlight when retorting and the damage increases in the head, the chaosites almost do not give you such an opportunity.
-Balance of crews for chaos. When 2 terminators roll out the entire Tim with volleys of missiles and do not react to the damage flying in them (they just do not care)
-The new enemy (biotin). Do you yourself are not ashamed? This is not a new enemy, even as a boss he is wretched. As a mechanic and mechanics of its destruction. I would understand if they added a mini-boss or especially enemy with some mechanics, but it's simpleshame.
-Disconnexes through the battle.The inability to be awarded to the game with which you threw you.Connection to the server is not the first time.
-This is mine, although who knows. I could make space -sizantnikika from Deathwatch and realized that heraldry is not on all orders for the right shoulder man. Yes, and the differences between other orders are very sparingly represented. It is complicated to make a salamandra, there are no heraldry, skins, etc.Some even amuse some (this is certainly a personal matter of everyone), but the space wolf (according to the colors of the armor of the soldier)) in the regalia of ultramarine causes only laughter.
-In ping as in PVP and PVP.

Pros
-Intense and dynamic combat
-Great graphics
-Interesting story so far
-Multiplayer is fun and addicting (have not tried PvP yet)
-There's a nice blend of needing to use all weapons at your disposal

Cons
-Friendly bot AI is not the best. They seem to be randomly aggressive and passive at weird intervals.
-The matchmaking system is quite unstable, leading to excessive load screens. I don't actually believe this is a server performance issue, I think it's how the matchmaking system is currently designed. *If a player queues for quick match and...: 1. gets a mission they don't like and leaves the squad. 2. does not want to be a party leader and leaves the squad / quits to title screen. ...this seems to have a direct impact on the players who get pulled into the queue of this player that did not stick around. I believe (not a confirmed fact) this is why we see a lot of ""joining server"" load screens that take a long time. I want to say the game is not optimized for dealing with these scenarios.

Pro/Con
-Ammo economy can be rough in some points of missions and can make progression more difficult than expected. Learning to search crates for ammo and being wise with ammo consumption helps with this.
-There is a strong focus on needing to use the parry system. Some people may hate that, others may not. Once you get the hang of it though, your gameplay improves quite a bit.
-Incoming damage is a bit rough, especially melee attacks, but this does condition you to block, parry, and improve movement more.
-There is an intense amount of grinding needed to achieve progression in multiplayer. Some may see this as a good thing to stay motivated to play, others may think it's too much of a grind fest and not enjoy it.
-Restricting multiplayer play to one class per player. This creates diversity however is an immediate generation of frustration for players who can't consistently play the class they wish to play.

Overall, I am enjoying the game. However, I would like to see some improvements before I feel I can confidently recommend the game.",2024/9/11,en

There is also a very fun but very dry no nonsense PVP akin to old COD lobbies but without the vulgarities, racism, and probably no no-scopes (yet).

Hope the devs update this ""Eternal War"" mode as well cause there is some good building blocks to work with.

Combat is very fun, consisting of dodges and parries to outmaneuver and counterattack the enemy respectively.

Not too much to learn other than the timings of parries/dodges and melee combos of each weapon but the chaotic horde-style gameplay will still sometimes give you problems even if you have mastered the intricate art of murdering other Alien lifeforms.

1. The fight is a full hat.Something can be done in battle 1 to 1. As soon as you meet with two 3 large beetles, all the parries are dodging and so on it goes forest.It is possible to cope with the crowd only if it is ordinary persimmon.
2. Shooting pistols of plasma bolts and so on is almost useless.You can, of course, shoot the jokes for the sake of jokes, but in general it is almost pointless.
3. There is almost no story company.Everything is imprisoned for a not very interesting coop.And the screensavers before the mission where you and your companions sit inside the ship generally smell of session crafts.
4. The missions are the same type and boring.Go around the tunnel, grate with beetles, see how they climb onto the wall on each other.
5. Dialogues of sailors are a separate cal.There is no need to talk about Beck of the Universe again.
6. There is no character of the character, from the word at all, all that can be changed is the skin from DLS.We are waiting for boxes with keys.
7. I didn’t play online, but remembering the first part and given the gameplay of this part there is a full hell.

Efendi_,0,76.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004908459/,"Regrettably i am leaving a negative review pointing out the serious shortcomings of Space Marine 2 as a veteran Vermintide/Darktide player who loves 40k lore.

- During the first launch of the game, Epic games online components are installed automatically without a prompt screen. I do not want it in my computer. You have to go through loops to uninstall it. There is a reason why i am using steam and steam only and i want the developers to respect it.
- When compared with Darktide, Dawn of War series and especially Mechanicus, Space Marine 2 has the weakest music OST. Looks like it was not even at top ten of the priority list during development.
- As a cheap attempt, the game is trying to draw more attention by Twitch drops.
- Very terrible companion ai. One of the worst i have seen for years. They do not use their ranged weapons in most cases and run gret distances to melee an enemy regarless of the class. And they very rarely execute a stunned elite enemy who is only two feet away from them. Such a shame.
- No FOV slider.
- Holding buttons to activate the abilities, instead of hitting them, is a terrible design choice.
- Throwing a frag grenade takes two seconds, activating cloak takes another 2.5 seconds. Character gets hit during uncancellable animations. Every movement and ability use feels unresponsive and stiff during the campaign and multiplayer. Runningg gets interrupted for no reason even if you are holding shift and not even hit by anything.
- Uncancellable dodge, roll over and similar animations are the primary reason why i keep dying. Controls feel very unresponsive.
- Boss fights are almost identical. Area attacks such as some form of 3 round mortar shots, melee charge attacks, ranged attacks and one big 3-wave either green or purple wide area attack which can hit even behind cover is the same rinse and repeat mechanic for both tyranid and chaos bosses.
- Melee combat is terribly designed. Interruptions are common and costs the player half of his health points.
- Ranged weapons feel weak. An elite enemy (Not a boss or a lecter) takes 30 to 40 bolter rounds to put down. Crossing bone swords makes the enemy immune to ranged damage even if you hit the legs, head or spray it from sides.
- The enemies i have mentioned above are bullet sponges but a hit from them take out half of your hp.
- Crowd control options are limited to grenades. I suggest developers to play Vermintide and Dark Tide to see how it is perfected during many years.
- There is a hideous terrible jetpack mission. I hated it.
- Multiple 'Loading resources - loading logic' screens.
- Entire multiplayer lobby system has to be redesigned. It is bad.
- You cannot inject your allies with the stimpack you have in your inventory.
- PVP section of the game is the worst. Very unbalanced. Is this game not beta-tested?
- Cheaters are out there already. I have already witnessed speedhacks and maphacks.
- Easy Anticheat is known as how 'Easy' it is to bypass it. A bad choice from the developers.
- The number of the co-op missions is very few. These missions in general feel rushed, unfinished and exteremely repetitive with very little variation. Even the spawn locations are more or less the same.
- Unlocking armor pieces or better versions of the same weapon is very grindy. This is how the game targets longevity.
- The game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly. I do not expect it to have a long lifespan.
- I was unable to pickup some medkits, ammo boxes or grenades even i had the inventory slot available. Pickup prompt was not there.
- Ranged enemies shoot with 120% accuracy and every shot lands perfectly.
- There is a shield or armor mechanic which recharges a specific amount with combo kills. This mechanic is not working as intended and definitely not user friendly.

Cnclusion: 6/10. Wait for a discount or buy the cheapest package if you must. After the hype is dead, the game will no longer be played by most of us. I believe that Space Marine 2 would be a great game if it was released 10 years ago.",2024/9/11,en

Humble Beings,1,32.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HERECATCH/,"Space Marine 2 improves from its predecessors by building up from what made it great for me in the past. Filling the shoes of Titus once more, you are now a Primaris marine (super space marine). Bigger and badder, you and two of your other buddies (coop) or AI companions are required to prune the Tyrannids (think Zerg from Starcraft, but much nastier) and put an end to their invasion.

Using the same engine from WWZ the devs at Saber Interactive have managed to capture what it would feel like to participate in an uphill battle against endless the Tyrannids. With hundreds of enemies on screen at the same time, you are required to use all you have in your arsenal and eliminate the xeno threat in the name of the God Emperor and boy is it intense on higher difficulties.

Though big and bad, you are still only human and while the smaller Tyrannids wont have you breaking a sweat the bigger and nastier ones will. I like how in higher difficulties you are required to time your attacks properly and use your ultimate move strategically to turn the tide against the horde of xenos rushing at you.

Simply put, I like the gameplay in Space Marine 2 as it manages to capture what it would feel like to be a super soldier in the 40k-verse, the small tyrannid variants explode as you stomp and chop your way through them, while the big ones will have you ripping off their heads in an execution style move.

Fun fact, you can literally run through small traitor guardsman and they would explode and turn into paste!

Story-wise it's your run of the mill 40K game, one minute you're dealing with a tyrannid invasion and the next will have you once again dealing with Chaos. It's nothing new, but the presentation is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Thanks to the technology that the devs utilize, the guardsman are in full display here and I was so happy to be able to fight alongside them once more.

So much stuff goes on in the background and in some instances you can even assist the fights that are happening in the background should you wish. It doesn't add anything to the story but it was nice to know that you are part of a larger scale fight and that everyone in the vicinity plays an important role in it.

For those who are worried, yes the game is a sequel but the events from the first game is told to you relatively well and not to mention its pretty straightforward. So no worries on not being able to catch up or anything if you did not play Space Marine 1.

Longevity-wise the game offers different game modes other than campaign such as Operations which is the PVE mode. This mode will have you squad up with pals and/or randoms to level up the different classes and unlock customization options. This customization is also extended to the PVP mode which is fine, I enjoy playing it with my friends and some matches can be quite intense at times.

All in all I think Space Marine 2 is a good game, the presentation is great, campaign was engaging and serving the God Emperor once more has never felt more satisfactory! an easy 7/10 for me!",2024/10/6,en

Really disappointed I have to give this game a thumbs down but Saber is not taking their Steam Deck / Linux player base seriously with the latest patch that has effectively bricked the game for almost all players on that platform. The AVF error bug is preventing everyone in that user group from connecting to multiplayer and the response from the Saber has been 'Wait until winter, Linux is not a big priority right now.'

The replacement of Linux builtin anti-cheat (which worked completely fine in the past) with EAC silliness has caused massive problems.

And so, paradoxically, GW started to take insipration from DoW themselves, further developing the 40k setting as we know it today.

Azrek,0,63.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004429967/,"I want to like the game, I really do. It just seems very flashy with no substance. Some of the kills or combos are great, but beyond that there are only 7 maps which play pretty much the same over any over again.

Customization of your guy ranges from a Bolter that does no damage, but fires fast to a bolter that does a slight bit more damage but fires slower to stabby bits which are either dull, weak, or useless. You will have moments where you feel powerful then go back to dumping 49 bolter rounds into 1 enemy who then proceeds to murder you completely unaffected by the weapon.

You cannot interrupt enemy attacks, moves, or critical strikes, but they can interrupt yours. The best thing to do is use the Codex Astartes approved front flip instead of movement because it makes you practically immune to all damage and you can't outrun anything anyway. I recall reading this in much of the lore on how Horus kept front flipping to get away from Sanguinius till he saw 1 opening to win. It is like having the high ground except you look silly. 90 enemies shooting at you? Front flip till you get behind cover! Melee guys all over you? Front flip away till your team can help you. I believe this move was covered in Chapter 27 of the Codex Astartes to include perfect form, how to properly tuck in your belly, as well as not get your giant nuclear backpack to get stuck on rocks.

Your Emperor approved Power armor is great except occasionally you'll get tangled up in those weeds in your garden you can't seem to eradicate or random dudes firing flashlights at you to great effect. It makes you wonder how some Astartes can become veterans as it seems everything can hurt us greatly. ""I fought in 100 campaigns! I was the first one shot in each mission and had to rest behind a rock till it was over, now I am the Captain because everyone else died 20 seconds later screaming something about glory. They made really attractive corpses though.""

I suppose the game has some potential, though it isn't as customization as Darktide, Rogue Trader or Daemonhunter. Most the Astartes will look the same though in different colors. Or your weapons look like they belong in a BDSM dungeon you have to sign a waiver for to get access.

If they can get the wonky controls fixed, some power to our weapons (or give us more powerful weapons with more enemies), and some more maps this game has some potential. Right now it is good for about a month then off to something else.",2024/11/7,en

Summary:
A game like those of yesteryear (that there is also not to go far), with a phenomenal story, shots to mansalva, very difficult and sometimes frustrating mechanics, but that once you exceed the level of gratification is high.Its history is spectacular and that all Warhammer or fan of the action will enjoy and the characterization of the characters is sublime, as it should be in all games.

History:
Simply brilliant, even if you are a fan of Warhammer 40k and come to look for shots, the story and how it develops in the end is exquisite, to be able to live the conversations of the chapter between soldiers, the ship, its hierarchy, the rest of theFactions that appear, characters excellently well defined and mature (in this Woke of Agenda 2030 where all are teenagers and men are not men, so you have to emphasize it).Do not expect anything else, action in raudales like any Gears of War was at the time and enjoy as a dwarf.

Graphics:
Spectacular is to fall short, as the story progresses and the particles are taking more paper, the experience of each level is increasing.Tyranids are great and the missions against them too, but in the end of half/end takes another concept.In addition, being able to live the battle in the field with the Astra Military and the rest of the chapter is incredible.Super immersive.

Playability:
This is where you can fail, SM2 The game introduces you to play in difficult and with the 4 tips that give you quite a regular way makes it very frustrating, it costs a lot to catch the quiet to the game and know when to defend yourself from the 4 shotsThey hit you and leave you on the floor.But I admit that in the face of half when I could understand how playing it I started enjoying a lot.Do not wait for a new invention, but within its simplicity it is just what you are looking for, action, shots and kill three hundred enemies.

Important:
No feminist political agenda in the game.Men are men, women women and history focuses on that: Warhammer 40k, not who is better than another or how another believes another.It's like games 5 years before the entire political agenda.Here you can sit and enjoy an action adventure.What I fear is that in the face of the next one they are going to put an agenda, so we will be enjoying the last title of the West that is for the great majority of the market.

Hopefully not!

the dodge indicator shows up got disappears before the enemy has even done the attack, leaving you clueless to when to actually time it correctly. Same goes for the parry indicator.

Campaign is about 10-12hrs give or take (at least it's twice as long as the first game).

The Multi player Pve missions are fun and tie in well with the Campaigns story.

Season Pass for 40€, you wot m8?

Never tried the PVP, but i'm not a pvp player and it looked just like the first games PVP.

Now should you buy this game?
If you really really enjoy the story of the Ultramarine Titus, then yeah sure buy it.
If you really enjoy Left 4 Dead playstyle games, Then yeah sure buy it.
BUT I would storngly urge you to buy it on a big sale, I got 16hrs out the game after doing 4 PvE missions, and the campaign on Angel of Death difficulty. It isn't value for money unless you buy the game for the PvE and PvP mode.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – A Brutal War in the Grim Darkness of the Future! (ฅ'ω'ฅ)

""An exhilarating, gory, and action-packed sequel that lives up to the scale of the Warhammer 40K universe, but with some notable flaws in balance and technical polish.""


Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 thrusts players into the brutal and unrelenting world of the Warhammer 40K universe, continuing the tale of the Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. Developed by Saber Interactive, this third-person action game places you in the superhuman armor of a Space Marine as you combat the horrifying Tyranid swarm in intense, blood-soaked battles. Building on the success of its predecessor, Space Marine 2 offers solo and co-op gameplay, featuring both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes to keep the action fresh and chaotic.


The moment you step into Titus' power armor, the scale of Space Marine 2’s combat becomes apparent. The game’s standout feature is its seamless combination of gunplay and melee combat, allowing players to switch between devastating bolter shots and brutal close-quarters executions. The spectacle of mowing down endless Tyranid swarms is both thrilling and terrifying, thanks to the sheer number of enemies onscreen, powered by Saber’s Swarm Engine.

The visuals are equally impressive, capturing the grim, gothic aesthetic of the 40K universe. From the ruined hive cities to the expansive battlefields littered with the corpses of xenos and humans alike, the game never shies away from its dark atmosphere. The orchestral score and guttural sounds of bolters firing and chainswords revving heighten the sense of chaos, making every battle feel cinematic.

However, the combat system, while exhilarating, does suffer from balance issues. Melee attacks dominate the battlefield, often making ranged weapons feel underpowered, particularly when faced with larger enemies. The tactical depth you'd expect from wielding the mighty bolter or plasma gun is somewhat diminished by their lack of punch, especially when it inexplicably takes a full magazine to down a basic Tyranid warrior. This can lead to frustrating moments, especially for players who prefer a ranged combat style.

The co-op and PvP modes are a welcome addition, extending the game’s replayability. Operations, the co-op missions, allow players to team up with friends to tackle harder challenges, but the real test comes in the PvP mode, Eternal War, where teams of Space Marines face off against the forces of Chaos. Both modes offer progression systems with plenty of unlockable perks and cosmetics, though the limited variety in mission design can make long play sessions feel repetitive.













Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers on its promise of fast, bloody, and exhilarating combat in the vast and unforgiving Warhammer 40K universe. The game’s atmospheric design, gripping story, and expansive multiplayer modes make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and action games alike. However, the imbalance between melee and ranged combat, along with some technical glitches, prevent it from reaching its full potential.

For those who love diving into the lore of Warhammer or who are looking for a gory, action-packed co-op experience, Space Marine 2 is a solid recommendation. Just don’t expect a perfectly polished experience or to rely heavily on your bolter.


If you enjoyed this review, make sure to follow our curator page for more in-depth Warhammer 40K content and action game recommendations. Join the fight against the xenos, and let’s cleanse the galaxy together! For the Emperor!ヽ(´• ω •`)ノ",2024/9/11,en

5ilverback_,0,11.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994388327/,"Im a huge Warhammer 40k fan.

I will post a deeper review but right now this is unplayable for me.
I have a monster pc. Visuals are great. But i keep getting disconnected every 15 min. I have a 500/500 mbit line, no issues with other games. I run my own servers on other games and people have zero issue connecting and staying connected etc.

I got the most expensive edition of the game. So far, story is OK.... visuals are great, custcenes are rly good, some animations are a little off, your shoulder gets dislocated every time you take a step. Voice acting is amazing top tier stuff huge thanks to the actors.

Gameplay tho is repetetive to death. You go to a area get and kill some mobs and u go to next area and kill some more mobs.
You run around a corner. The enemy literally stands stationary. Not even reacting to you untill you get close enough. It just feels so janky and doesnt ""flow"" at all. In those situations mobs dont feel ""alive"" at all. They are just waiting for me to kill them so i can go to the next area...

And its hella empty on content. Not enough missions for the pve. Not deep enough missions to keep the pve interesting. And to be honest customization is a little meh. How many years of dev and this is it? And then you bundle up some more customization stuff for dlcs and lock it behind some random named currency.. Come on, What do you think this is? Im gonna wait here like a little puppy for 3-4-5 months untill u give me one skin of each, one weapon, one armour skin, and some random faction that basically dont mean anything. And this is going to keep me hyped to play? gtfo i payed 99 bucks for this ♥♥♥♥ dude and i still disconnect constantly and it infuriates me because i have a hard time playing pve and pvp.

Weapons are like pee shooters. Melta guns/cannons doesnt melt ♥♥♥♥. Literally 2 meters from a bioform the heavy melta should incinerate that bio like nothing, but i put 3 shots in to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and he still running around like i tickled his chin. The bolter is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand rocket launcher and face shots do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They are getting miniature rocket powered artillery shells that are specifically design to pierce armour and blow up right in the face and they just keep walking. I understand its a game, but i dont feel ""Space Marine"" powerfull at all.,

If this is primaris space marine. It feels like a downgrade. You pop 2 shots off before the enemy is to close so you start to flail around like a spastic ape trying to put in some ""combos"". These combos are so slow that you manage to get swarmed so now you have to start rolling around like a moron and swinging randomly to get ads down before you can focus on the bigger guys that have been shooting at you from a distance.

Primaris marine? Everything hurts. One of these smallest creatures step on your toes you take damage.
These primaris marines take damage from the smallest las gun from a grunt. While on the internets you can clearly see space marines comfortably standing in front of a stationary las turret and eat that like the tank that he is. Not in Space Marine 2. I guess they made the primaris armour a little softer so it doesnt chafe as much in the crotch area....

Space marine 2 made me kinda understand why they turned to the chaos gods for more power......

Ive read alot of the lore. And the story depth that exists for 40k is almost immeasurable. Space Marine 2 story feels a little rushed. There is so much story they could have put in to this about the chaos marines for example. Where they come from. Their primarch etc or sooomething more.
When they showed up on screen it felt like. Here is your new enemy, he looks like you but he has a special hat and hes purple. And im chasing this mfker asking myselfe why the ♥♥♥♥ can he teleport?
And i cant let go of the tought if alot of it got left on the cutting floor.

My second heart hurts that i have to give this a negative review.
If the connection issues dont get solved and we dont get some amazing dlcs for rly cheap.
This season pass for 39 bucks is not ok either. 20 bucks difference from the full game? The season pass is not worth the 39 bucks. Not even close. I dont think its even worth 20 bucks.
A couple missions for pve and pvp maps and some small skins....39?

I know you are getting alot of praise right now by the normies impressed by the visuals and the ""fresh"" gameplay. And the people who are starstruck from the sheer weight of the 40k franchise. You might wiggle your finger at those people and have them easily impressed.

But im looking at you. And i see what you are doing. I take my hat off for a step at the right direction compared to some of these other devs. But i see what you are doing and i dont like being taken for a fool. These dlcs better be damn good.

Not impressed what so ever. Horrible launch for the price that I payed for at least. And i have been playing warhammer games since the 90s.",2024/9/22,en

Alas!Good teeth!

Under the blessing of the new generation of the screen, this 40K battlefield shocked this one, and it is also pointed in many difficult 40K games.

But why not recommend it?

Because I have played the difficulty of the death angel and I am puzzled by some designs of the game

In a single game:
The infamous elevator guards the 4 chain, and it can be said that it has certain requirements for your efficiency of killing the enemy to flexibly use the scene resource to pass the grenades and explodes the grenades.

However, I can’t understand the scene of the mechanical database development motor. The scene requires you to use the fireproofer to expel the torn worm and turn on the engine and guard for a period of time.
OK, why do you need to set up a long -handed remotely to deal with it when you need to remotely maintain environmental security with short hands?

The pistol can control OK, but the difficulty of the death angel causes the brain insect and meat without changing a large gun.In the case, hit the brain insect to red temperature

OK, can I clean up the ground efficiently and then dry the brain?However, the difficulty of death angels lead to all worm meat and flesh, ordinary double -knife samurai also requires two sets of combo or two guns to hit the red temperature while paying attention to the small tadpoles on the ground.

Can the fireproofer barbecue?You can pinch but the fire is too bright. You can't see the blue circle and red circle. You can only be Euler with the worm. If you are not careful, you will be killed by the despicable insects in the sky in the sky.

Then change the big gun.EssenceEssenceWhy do you have a 1.5 -second confirmation circle for picking a gun?EssenceEssenceWhat blood bag is 1.5 seconds?EssenceEssenceEssenceThe grenade also wants.EssenceEssenceObviously the bullet was taken in an instant.EssenceEssence

In the end, I was red and warm. The crazy grenade skills were used to get the medicine back to the blood generator Qin Wang around AI.
It feels that the core problem is the difficulty of death, it seems that worms have changed meat.Under the difficulty of the veteran soldiers, the warrior 1 shot and 2, 3 knives (1 set of half a consecutive move) can be red and warm, and the death angel requires 2 shots plus 2, 3 sets (two and a half consecutive moves) to red temperature

And our Grandpa Thailand uses his mediocre 3+ shotgun (other weapons is also the basic value), whether it is the veteran or the death angel.EssenceThere was no upgrade content during the battle, which caused Grandpa Thai to use the whiteboard value of the whiteboard value even when it was duel with the final BOSS duel.

Multi -player game PVE:
""Oh, ah, this game is just a single player to support a card. Why is it tangled about this?"" I said nothing wrong with you. I think the feelings of this game.I only tried PVE, so PVP did not comment for the time being.

It can be seen that the production team spent a lot of energy to create 6 occupations, each occupation nearly 20 characteristics, nearly 20 weapons, each weapon, each has a variety of varieties and upgrades, and it feels very dark.The mission is the deputy team that played Grandpa Thai Grandpa in the plot. It is as difficult as the plot.After watching the upgrade options of the weapon, it turned out that Grandpa's 3+ shotgun can finally become 9+. No wonder the difficulty of death is so difficult to be the most elite blue elves outside the main battlefield (red temperature)

Three melee occupations (mad war, assassin, tank) 3 long -range occupations (rifles, sniper, machine gun brothers) can also experience all kinds of fun Thai grandpa for each occupation?Grandpa Tai is the grandfather.

But some of the settings of the game always make me a little confused:
Life value replies: It seems that there are no rest stations in various PVE games in the game. Only the weapon stations for changing equipment. There are only a few blood bags in the map that need to be distributed between three saudial elves, resulting in the blood volume in the task.The more and less in the middle.除了少数职业有“在XX情况下回复1%血量”或者“30%血量下，只要XX就能恢复5%血量”这种回血的天赋，大多数人只能靠倒了拉起和Rebirth to restore your own state.It is indeed a problem with difficult cooperation.

Shield value: Obviously, the production team hopes that the player will make more guns, and the shield will be made to reduce the pressure on the blood bars. Although there is invincible time, it seems that the gun will be interrupted by the red circle attack.The execution of the animation is very handsome, but it is also full. For example, the worm is red and warm. I am a machine gun brother. I may continue to scan and continue to scan two more shots.Worm.It feels that in the actual combat, most people are almost after the team battles are almost finished, and the insects who will challenge the red and warm back are back. I think the better situation is that the elite and the knife and insects have been executed for 1 second to 2 seconds. This may be close to melee.Occupation is more friendly.

Pick up things: 1.5 seconds, why?Make up ammunition?OK, full state, a little punishment, understanding.gun?Afraid of getting the wrong gun, okay.Grenades?I'm afraid that I will change the wrong grenade.Blood bag?Are you afraid I will get more blood bags?The general design waiting circle is because there are multiple uses or conflicts with other behaviors, or the items overlap, or the important choice of key items.The residual blood stimulated all the way to the sloppy worm and finally saw a blood bag & grenado result and could not pass by picked it up (red temperature)

Enemark reminder: The red circle prompt behind appears, you guess what it is.Whether the samurai crosses me, or the brainworm loses me towards me, or the snake worm stab me or the ax is going to throw me.The brain insect is thrown twice, and the rays may be delayed.The only rays that can be recognized are sniper.This has not involved the chaos.What elites on the field rely on the punctuation of good people, especially the Tyron family rushed over in a ball. The light samurai was 4 variants.People.Anyway, the dark tide also gave the elite the big green night view instrument, and inserted some totems on the head of the head, saying that there was a force to say something.There is no special sound effect on this group of white purple and purple tooth dance claws.

Criminal control: clear group, PVE classic bridge section.Do you know Brother?I feel like it is close to the battle brother sucking monsters. The two shot madly.Once the melee brother can't hold it, it seems that there is no occupation to have ridicule, push, block similar skills, and the pressure of long -range brothers has increased greatly.Qingqun weapons are sledgehammers and charging power swords, followed by machine guns, hot melt.Most of the maps have fewer places such as corridor room passing.

Then 6 pictures, so many occupations, so many weapons, just one word, liver.There are 4 aggressive agents in the dark tide, and there are six saudious elves here!IntersectionHowever, there is no weapon entry, and the talent is more passive but not connected to the weapon. It is difficult to imagine what motivation can continue to brush after full level.

I have given so much to give me a not recommendation, because I feel that the content now seems to be at a glance, but I also hope that this game can be done well.40K is known for its dung tour. In the past few years, the game that has changed but the game is also a history of chocolate or chocolate flavor.However, with the publication of the merchant Ronin and the response of the praise of the combat brothers in September 9th, the weapon system will be updated at the end of the dark tide at the end of the month. Is the good life of 40K people come?
Finally, I hope that the SABER group will develop well, with more pictures, and more distinctive and recognizable enemies, which will enable players to develop the talent of interesting gameplay and some of the problems I described above.EssencePlease change it.EssenceEssenceOr do you understand why I designed why?

Thank you

Review on September 9th

My God has never seen such an unstable server after playing Swedish fat shark
Be strange to one more card operation, one more card, just card, as long as people want to do a ""bomber anti -gun, roll over and spray hot melt again"", the basic operation of the strange group of swimming has a high probability that the server explodes directly
At first I thought it was too high to open the screen, the computers can’t work too much for the particle special effects
The full -opening and low effects are still this way to give you one card, one card, the difficulty melee, do n’t play the knife, and you ca n’t fight the Asian space interference. Total of the September 9th list is to welcome the fighting brothers as chives?Intersection

The PVE weapon is completely unbalanced, and the existence of various models of shotguns is meaningless. The efficiency is not as efficient as hot melt and long -range efficiency.
Hot melting kills all penetrating values ​​unlimited damage and unlimited high, and the talent of killing and rebound is hot -melt.
The special combat soldiers have a 15000+ damage 450+ kill each melee and the two melee will not be able to get together.
Melee brother pure buff pendant person gives hot -melt tactical Gothic back to the shield skills
Special combat brothers and even long -range shield skills can cause AOEDOT damage to add BUFF to the surrounding combat brothers. This special war brother is the core of melee?Intersection

Danie,0,27.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/daniele20/,"The game started light on content with puzzling design choices, but I was willing to give it a chance as the premise seemed good.

After this first update where the developers doubled down on nerfing stuff and buffing absolutely nothing, introducing a new difficulty where everything is tankier, in a game where the enemies already felt like bullet sponges... I really cannot reccomend it for the amount of content it offers at the moment.

The combat when you look at it is pretty shallow and at high level of play there's three usable classes in PVE with one good weapon, the rest are literally unusable as they deal too little damage. The entire melee weapon roster is underpowered, in a game where melee is supposed to be the focus of the combat system.
(You can literally look up the datamined DPS values of weapons and compare them yourself.)

Half the class roster feels like it's filled with useless perks that activate on very conditional triggers and the PVP is an unbalanced mess that is already getting swarmed by cheaters.

If you really love warhammer then it might still be a worthy purchase, but honestly I regret spending money for a 12 hours long campaign that has no replayability whatsoever, coupled with multiplayer modes that also offer no replayability or reward. (other than unlocking new colours for your space marines, wohoo!)

At this point it feels like no matter how shallow a game is, as long as you have pretty graphics and speak against the ""DEI Agenda"" then you'll have a ton of gamers supporting your game and saying it's amazing.",2024/10/18,en

JakeCook,1,155,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JakeCookSC/,"In the unfathomable and merciless darkness of the 41st millennium, only war and duty endure. For a veteran who has devoted over 25 years to the universe of Warhammer 40,000, it is not merely a pastime, but an existence dedicated to tales of courage and fury. Local Games Workshops are no longer just stores; they are sanctuaries of fervor where meticulously painted miniatures awaken under the hands of devoted artisans. Some, like my brother, have even achieved local fame, while masters such as Jérémie Bonamant shine on a national scale.

Witnessing the armies of the Astartes, the Tyranid hordes, and colossal war machines come to life in a video game reignites the latent passion of the old warrior I’ve become. It’s a triumphant return to the glory days, where every detail, from the smallest Imperial icon to the legendary Land Raiders, is recreated with breathtaking fidelity, capturing the very essence of what it means to be a servant of the Emperor.

The campaign is an epic of rare intensity, where neophytes and veterans alike unite in a brutal, merciless spectacle. It is a blood-soaked work, where steel and determination clash, a perfect outlet for those seeking to escape the monotony of their banal lives. Under the command of the iconic Sergeant Demetrian Titus, you embark on an unrelenting crusade against countless enemies, some of whom appear for the first time in a video game to face the wrath of the Imperium, all modeled with a meticulousness worthy of the Omnissiah.

The game’s PvE is praised for its demand, rewarding those who master the art of combat and forge their Space Marine with care, without ever drowning in sterile complexity. The gameplay, as fluid as a bolter spewing death, transcends the heaviness of the armored hero. Every step of this warrior, weighing like a Rhino, is felt in the heat of battle. As for PvP, while it offers epic clashes, it still lacks that brutal essence that permeates the universe of the 41st millennium.

In conclusion, this opus is a divine offering to those who seek an intense escape into fury and glory. But be warned, the path is fraught with challenges, the difficulty is high, and learning the patterns is essential if you do not wish to be torn apart by a Tyranid. Find yourself battle-brothers, for only heroes united under the Emperor's banner survive the storms of fate. It is a masterpiece for the initiated, a final war cry that will pin you to your throne.

The blessings of the Omnissiah:
• Imperial visuals: The graphics, in 4K Ultra, are grand frescoes capturing the majesty of the Imperium’s cruisers in the cold void of space.
• Heroic crusade: Every mission is an epic battle where heroes are covered in glory and receive the highest honors.
• Tactical maneuvers: The gameplay, as sharp as the skirmishes of the Space Marines, challenges Xenos and heretics with a consuming rage.
• Homage to the ancestors: A saturated ode of references, as faithful as the archives of the Mechanicum, preserving the very essence of the original game.

But the work is not finished:
• PvP too limited: Clashes between Space Marines must capture more of the brutality of the 41st millennium.
• Endgame content: The Mechanicum must forge more missions and quests to extend the heroes’ epic journey.
• Bestiary too limited: The battlefields thirst for new enemies, whether it be rampaging Orks, Necrons, or the cunning T’au.
• Warp instabilities: The Tech-priests must resolve the server disruptions to ensure a stable experience.
• Uneven difficulty: Some enemies, like the Neurothrope, seem beyond the reach of mere mortals.
• Capricious parries: Squads must perfect their mastery of close combat to ensure effective responses to enemies.
• Resilience of the Primaris: The Apothecarion must enhance protocols to ensure the Primaris reflect their legendary invincibility against the hordes.

The Forges of Mars are already active, preparing future improvements. For the path to glory never ends in the unforgiving universe of the 41st millennium. For the Emperor and for humanity, this game aspires to ascend among legends.

PS: As a devoted servant of the Imperium, I can attest that my war machine, forged in the most powerful industrial worlds, knows no failure or weakness. No crashes, no framerate drops trouble the blessed functioning of this technological relic. My cogitator runs with immeasurable power, so much so that even in 4K Ultra, it barely awakens, effortlessly maintaining 60 FPS (capped), like an Astartes meditating before battle. However, I understand that some may face the dark forces of optimization with configurations less blessed by the Omnissiah. May the Machine Spirit aid them!",2024/9/21,en

I admit, I didn't find the game that much harder last patch but frankly, I just dislike nerfs to PVE experiences in general so I will rate negatively on principle.

[4.1 Review] Glad to see a responsive set of devs this time around who seriously considered whether they were correct in their decisions or not. Removing the Armor Tether is a great change since the initial system was poorly thought out to begin with. Hopefully they add a different modifier down the line that creates meaning without hamstringing your own gameplay. Also glad to see the Bolt weapons finally getting the love they deserve. Honestly, it was criminal how lousy they were at the start since Saber have managed incredible Bolt weapon sound design and feel that just made them feel good to shoot despite being impractical due to low damage. I'm generally ambivalent toward the armor changes but hopefully it gives more people more margin for error due to not everyone being parry gods or being so overwhelmingly good that they can carry a whole team out of a completely FUBAR scenario single-handedly. Keep up the good work, Saber. The community will reward you for it, I can guarantee that.",2024/10/17,en

Hyampleino game is good, good impact and very cool to knead tyranids, and the graphics are also quite good and beautiful, but there is an unrealistic but also a huge minus and probably in 2024 it is one ofthe worst. Yes, my computer is not the most powerful, namely i5 10400f, RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, SSD. But even so I don’t even have a 60 card and you will write about the effect of a “bottleneck”, but I write to you right away thatThe processor is also not to be loaded even under 60). I changed the settings of the graphics and the difference between the minimum and maximums. There are no maximum 5 fps, and the card is also underloaded. Even 60fps in the game, it seems torn, and even on the cards you will also see these 60-70 FPS only in empty locations. In a batch, meet 40FPS or 50FPS at best. DLSS in the game is already better than Taa and DLSS can be easily on quality. I read Reddita and found out that the problem lies that the game is very dependent on the processor, or more preciseTherefore, only major processors will write about good optimization to you. Therefore, it’s even difficult to play the game because of this.",2024/10/30,ru
Stay Frosty,0,12.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NinthGrove/,"In all honesty, i was very hyped for this game and avoided any game play footage or deep dives into the game. pre-purchased as i played the first one and can confidently say, Space Marine was an absolutely great game for its time (Emphasis on for its time. Key factor for this review) So the date of release comes around and i boot up and dive in. I'm going to keep this short and to the point. The Campaign was absolutely amazing, the scenes of battle and fighting through battlefields was amazing and immensely fun. They really captured the feel of 40k with every mission. Superb.... Roughly 8-9 hours later.... Story finished.... And honestly i cant give any reason to come back to this game after finishing the campaign. I had built up in my head that they were going to go down the Hell Divers route with this game and open it up a bit, really expand on the online social aspect of it. But they never. Its a very linear short story which is great mind you. Cant fault the gameplay and story at all. its Space Marine 1 improved, not expanded and that's my problem with it. There are like... 6-8 online operations that you can play as a team online with 2 other players and you can play those over and over again i suppose if you want to unlock different armors etc.... but to what end? To play through the same 6 missions with new armor? There is the online but like Space Marine 1, i just cant recommend it at all. Played one match and noped out of there. Does a linear story at 8 hours long survive in today's climate? I'm not sure. But i would be lying if i said i wasn't disappointed that i'm essentially just uninstalling this game after playing it for 8 hours. Though those 8 hours were fun and very well put together story wise. If you're fine with a linear 8 hour story with some side content sprinkled in to top it off then i would say go for it. If you were hoping for more to get engaged with and dive in deeper, i just cant justify getting it for the price. Its Space Marine improved.... Not expanded.",2024/9/7,en

Queen Frau the Round,1,69,https://steamcommunity.com/id/queenfrau/,"A slight departure from the first game, but a good one!

Originally I left a negative review on this game after I started a new campaign on Veteran. ""I just did my fourth play-through of Space Marine 1!,"" I thought, ""I'm basically a Veteran already!"" Oh how wrong I was. I got frustrated that I kept dying, and blamed the game for it. It wasn't until I put more hours in that I finally caught my stride, and I can play Veteran comfortably. For your first campaign run, I suggest playing on Normal.

Space Marine 2 continues the tale of badassness of Demetrian Titus, and I feel it definitely does him justice. The campaign is short, sweet, and bombastic as all Hell and jumps the shark (positive) in the final two missions. The writing is solid, the gameplay loop hard but fun.

The biggest change from SM1 to SM2 is the melee combat. The chainsword retains the exact same combo from the first game, which is a welcome change, but the combat system surrounding it is different. Executions no longer directly repair Health, but instead give you one pip of armor, and contested Health.

So your total health pool has non-regenerating Health and regenerating Armor. In SM1 it worked much like Halo, where the armor was a separate bar that regens after a small amount of time. In SM2, the armor is divided into 'pips', each one a set amount of HP. Before the Sept. 29, 2024 patch, each chaff enemy would hit you for one pip of armor. So if you are hit twice, you are now bleeding non-recoverable health damage. Now, they just do damage as if you are hit by anything else.

Executions now regenerate armor, usually 1-2 pips depending on difficulty. You can also regenerate armor via parrying. Yes, there's now parrying and parry windows in this game, marked by a big blue indicator. Red indicators, you must dodge, with an i-frame dodge. And one top of that, if you recently took Health damage, you can deal damage back to regen contested health. Oh, and if you stun enemies, you can also do a gunstrike that deletes chaff and staggers bigger targets with a 1-pip armor regen and no i-frames.

This is like a weird mix of Bloodborne and SM1, and requires a bit of practice and old-habit deletion to get down, but once you're in the flow, it's a wonderful time. The power fantasy has shifted from 'I can just walk all over Orkz with ease' to 'I can dodge, shoot, duck, weave, and destroy 'nids with skill.' It's fun!

Oh, and like the first game, the Meltagun / Melta Rifle is goated.",2024/9/14,en

Glory to the Emperor!

Ok so, after 40 hours playing mostly operations I still recomend the game with some caveats.

The campaign is amazing.

The difficulty pushing in OPS tho is retarded.
There are so many problems with difficulty that has been written by me and DodoSwarm on the offical forums I will just link the thread.



Bottom line is difficulty needs heavy tweaking or there has to be an economy added for armory data/requisition.

If you are not into ball busting difficulty (like inferno on diablo 3 release), but want to progress and not satisfied with PVP and Campaign offerings don't buy it.
Operations higher difficulty is a mess.

It shows that it is made about the WWZ engine and the combat is not all as necessary, but it compensates it with a variety of weapons and the possibility of helping between three.On the other hand, things like not being able to leave a mission in half for being linked to the server, the experience shaves a little, but it is still very high.

Valhorren,1,90.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Valhorren/,"Laziness to paint pros and cons, so there will be pure emotions - this is ecstasy.
For a fan of Wahi, this is an absolute masthead, this is the same AAA project that we have been waiting for so many years, setting, plot, iconic characters - you just sit and screech like a child.Epic only increases with each mission and in general the company goes as much as necessary.A bunch of steep staged scenes, incredibly beautiful and detailed locations - this is just some kind of festival of pathos and admiration.

Usually, after passing onto a fresh head, you begin to look for the cons, but here I just do not see them objectively, except for a not too balanced fighting, where you lose all the hp and without a cooperative to drag the Laste of difficulty just anryl.But in general, the fighter is cool, she literally lacks 10-20% of the grinding so that you can always drag on the skill, because sometimes there are so many enemies that you do not have time to dodge, spar and plus can be canceled, which also sometimes makes you get a slap in the face.But in general, for the entire company I have never felt a sense of stuffiness and that I want to drop everything.

The only returning to difficulty, I strangled to play at 3 and became 2 and even there you can see the problems of balance, it does not strongly spoil the impressions of the game for 2 difficulties, all that is not higher than a balanced blood pressure that will need to be corrected if I tried to go throughEverything is on them, most likely, it would not have any reason for the wing of the developers as a majority of negative reviews, so I hope that after a full release, the developers will somehow correct this with patches, otherwise it is non-granous.

In general, this is currently the coolest, large -scale game of Wahe, every fan must pass it without fail, and an ordinary player can also enjoy it and MB even roll up.I am incredibly satisfied and pleasantly amazed that the studio surpassed all my expectations, without even touching the online component, one company is already repulsing any price, so I look forward to the trickel.",2024/9/9,ru
Rory,1,196.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198153189020/,"The game of the bomb, I do not regret the 5K spent on this masterpiece.
The game in the Angel of Death gives you a certain test.which you can pass if you have straight hands.
The company itself is a fire, you just run along the locations that were worked out as much as possible to the smallest details, I still remember how the commissioner raised the fighting spirit to his guys, the amazing Loka of the necrons, straight to the goosebumps, when he was on the approach and saw symbols and began to guess whatA huge ass was excavated by the Martian mother of their geniuses.And the scene with the flag ..... I literally smiled, how cool it was.
Operations in the game are also beautiful, especially if you go parallel to the plot, because all this is intertwined.The fighting brothers are thrown by interesting remarks that give a plus of wyb for those who rummage in the topic, and of course, the expanses reveal the character of spaceships and a bit of their life.
The developers are also handsome, in the subject they clearly understand the smallest details, and clearly watch what the players write about the game.

But there is always ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyway.These are disadvantages.
So, let's start just with the fact that the game is very, very many whiners, because if there were few of them, then it is unlikely that the outfits were nervous recently out of just a couple of days.
It was really insulting, since at least some Chelenga appeared in the game because the game really experienced you and your brothers for strength because before that the game has become an Isi even on the existing Max, we literally ran out at 2 snoutsMisses with non -nuclear classes and guns, and when we saw a new difficulty ... It was cool, and the reward ... It was worth my brothers.And so we went through everything on new complexity pretty much, especially thanks to the Chaosites (I hate these creatures (but loving)), we are laughing as a kind part of the players cry and whine, which is too complicated and go unrealistic and they came to the game for Fun, and they came to the game for FunThis is not Fun at all, you can certainly say -“Put the moron of the difficulty lower than once.”, So they want to unlock everything in the game, they just don’t want to learn, the main thing is that they are given to the stupid fun, only these whiners are givenThey will not be able to know that joy when you go through this very stage of complexity and understand that now you yourself have actually become an angel of death.
Well done, too, well done, in the stupid they listened to these nonsense and naranfili the difficulty in the trash, it is very sad, of course, but now we and the brothers have passed the first days of the 5th difficulty will remember this and every time to say as old grandfathers, it used to be better.

Well, you can still say about PVP in this game, but I do not want to, since it is a rudimentary shit, we bend your fingers:
The balance has come out and smokes on the sidelines (thanks that at least the vanguard is subordinate)
Grenades are represented in 4 types opening along the pumping, but the most usable is shocking as: 1) control of a huge zone in the form of damage, which still does not lady the owner, meanwhile, the operation transfers greetings for such jokes 2) Blind literally until the end of your life 3) The fierce slowed down.In this one grenade, there is more meaning than in the others
The matchmaking of which is not, here you can still remember the balance because the weapon that opens with the rank humiliates in the trash, yes, yes Melta and plasma, I'm talking about you
Cards, what about cards?They are beautiful to horror, exactly like small and thanks to respowed per second, when I stood on an enemy home, I thought that I was fighting with a bunch of tyranids, not spaceport.And there are few cards
The close battle in the PVP shit for the one who was the first to hit, and the so -called parrying does not work, and even if he worked, then hello random ping in the team A and B.
Speaking of classes, a slight deviation from the humiliation of PVP in the game, there is a feeling that the game has normal classes, cool classes and an attack aircraft, here is the attack aircraft - this is the most hated creation of developers, it has humiliated it in this part, my friend almost cried.
There are many aspects for which you can still scold the game, but I will not, because playing this mode on serious droves, and even more so solo is unlikely to be.

Castomiz is straight a cool, if you do not take into account that the game has colors that are not stupidly displayed as they should, as an example, in the game there is no normal black in the game, then a half-black dull shit I refuse to take for a full-fledged black, a gold of a normal person recentlyOnly added, well, the symbolism is monstrously little, but it will be corrected with time, and in general - a bomb.

The result of sowing the seedlings
In the soul is not tea for whom I write this and why, and who will read it at all.
In general, the game went straight, the developers dispelled the myth that they were wow 40k and, in principle, probably according to Waha, they make shit, not games.I’m more sure that after even a few hundred hours of the spent in this game I will be pleased to return and cut into the minced meat of local cockroaches because how it is all done and animated directly leads me to children's joy, and of course there are models.

weapon variety, enemy variety, ramping up difficulty in combat, powering up/adding skills all REALLY lacking.

Combat is OK, melee is ONE (1) button, and feels a little float-y and doesn't have much ""punch"" you kind of just glide through enemies without resistance (outside of executions). parry/dodge/counter works sometimes, doesn't feel consistent. You end up getting staggered, stun locked, or stuck in a reload way to often. It's often not clear why you've taken damage or from where. The input/output in combat just feels kinda weird.

You have to push the SAME button 5000 times, whether an elevator or some other interaction with the environment, it's the same asset. Never a puzzle, or a different way to ""activate"" whatever needs to be activate. Clearly cut corners here.

Cut scenes, pretty good. Some odd points where it feels like a set piece should go fade to black and back in instead. Seems they rushed in several spots.

Story, bare bones but fine. Didn't utilize one of the best-developed fantasy worlds in all of fiction. Voice acting is excellent, and so is the writing though.

.

Other games do what this game should, but better. Helldivers II has better combat. This game takes a lot influence from DOOM, but doesn't execute as well: guns lack punch, glory kills are less rewarding, you have to pause to pick up ammo, mis-calibrated resource scarcity, too many 1 shot horde enemies, too little variety besides ""more"" enemies and no coordination among them.

- It does not make sense to have operations and pvp not transfer your level in between each other. If I grind my level in operations my level should be the same for pvp so that I can access all the weapons I grinded for.
- make it easier to level up
- Add another class like tech marine, apothecary, chaplain
- Make it so that heretic astartes are not locked in to only 1 class

Additions:
- For pvp they should add execution kills to make the game cooler
- Add a parry mechanic because melee against character feels just like who hits first gurantees a win.
- Buff the assault class it is definitely the weakest class overall. Make the animations fast , maybe give it a stun when it slams in the air and more armor so it does not instantly die and add lightning claws.
- Add more voice lines for the narration and the characters its annoying only hearing the same phrases over and over
- Give the heretic astartes more customization options as it is a bit disappointing that you can only change their color
- add more traitor legions like emperors children, wordbearers, sons of horus, and Thousand sons
- give loyalist unique voicelines for loyalist legions as it was done for heretics
- Add more enemies from different chaos factions other than Tzeetch.

UR WELCOME i didn't destory this review ............. ok this game is good i love the blood shed was cool hope they add claws and wait what was i doing",2024/9/11,en

Judge Cudge,0,6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012825255/,"You do not feel like a Space Marine in this game.

In singleplayer PVE on just veteran difficulty, which is supposedly the intended experience, even (close to) perfect play rewards you with gameplay of being constantly whittled down by weenies into flickeringly low hp when reacting to all commands perfectly and swiftly headshotting and executing every enemy whilst never being hit by even a single clean attack from anything other than explicitly and only small enemies hitting you during your own melee attack combos on larger ones.

Why is the game this way?
Even supposing this is somehow balanced around multiplayer, the mindset that somehow your hypervulnerability is the right way to accomplish this is just incorrect.

This isn't left for darktide (tm) where teamwork needs to be clumsily reinforced by having insta downs/squishiness that let people pretend they are helping eachother in the most hamfisted design decision of all time.

We are walking super human tankmen fighting bugs, and the intended gameplay experience leaves you scrambling for medicae at all times.

I win every time, but I never once feel cool or strong, and further because I am so limited on HP and ammo my reactions are all on rails.
I ALWAYS have to go for the gun reaction post parry.
I ALWAYS have to go for a cutscene execute to gain armor.
I ALWAYS have burn grenades at swarm pillars cascading up walls.
I ALWAYS pick up and use the 'use here' guns like the flamethrower.
I ALWAYS use my super mode on cooldown to scrounge HP.

I feel like a pathetically weak and clunky man walking through a giant quick time event.

Why did they do this? How is being a paper mache weakling who is forbidden from making gameplay decisions the 'intended experience'?

I want to feel like a space marine.
Unless there are changes, the game fails at what is supposed to make it compelling, though it is undoubtedly beautiful and cool looking.",2024/9/11,en

I recommend a stretch with a stretch for passing with friends.

The game has one big plus - you feel half the time in the epicenter of the blockbuster.A lot of fat thick action with hordes of enemies.WAU effect is guaranteed.

And there are many minuses:

1. The game is annoying.At the same time, you need to protect several objects in different parts of the base.The sensors give you a signal that you need to parry the attacks right now.And you are not up to it.At the same moment, the operator nervously yells at you that the Gorguli damaged the antenna.And you still need to recharge very slowly at this second while the beetles are eating you.And you need to do this somewhere every five seconds.

2. I did not like the shooting right away.It is not felt here as cool as, for example, in Destiny, or Hell Divers 2. somehow nothing special.

3. Instead of combat dance - awkward confusion.This is if you, like me, are hard to combine 3D action with Dark Souls - yes, here you need to regularly tumble and parry the attacks.How tired it is ...

4. The cartoon of shock heroes can be forgiven.But seriously the game is more difficult to perceive.

5. A lot of invisible walls.

And the game freezes at the exit.

I don’t even attribute a completely passing plot to the minuses, it is here for a checkmark.And it is balanced as a whole by high -quality graphics.",2024/9/11,ru
Shinigami-Sama,1,40.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130967517/,"Having just finished the game i am of two minds about it:

The Good: It builds on the first game and does a great job of making you feel like a space marine. Your powerful and hit like a truck, it is friendly to the lore and brings the world of 40k to life. I have seen some reviews talking about the first half of the game being the worst part and i have to disagree. The first half of the game defending worlds from tyranids is amazing and exciting. Watching a whole swarm descend on a guarded position as you, your brothers and the scared guardsmen hold the line is great.

And now here is where the bad comes in:

The second half of the game feels like a rehash of the first game. It feels like they just wanted to have you fight chaos for pretty much no reason other than you did it in the first game. This is a issue as it left me wanting more, you just seemingly wipe the nids and chase chaos and to me this was boring. When they showed there would be three worlds to fight on i was expecting a long story where i am jumping from world to world dealing with its attackers and i feel this is what saber should have done. It should have been you fighting the nids on one world whilst chaos attacks another and a 3rd faction the other and then have them merge. But instead its simply hey you seemingly dealt with the nids now go fight chaos for the last act.

Overall i recommend it if you are a fan of 40k or the first game as it does fill the need of 40k fun and that fun from the first game. Just dont expect it to fill you at the current moment roughly 2 days of playing and i have finished the story on veteran i expected more saber. Hopefully a DLC will come out with more missions",2024/9/8,en

ВАСЯ,1,38.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vasilevskiy1/,"This isn’t just a game; it’s a pilgrimage into the grimdark glory of Warhammer 40K, where every bolter shot sings praises to the Emperor and every Tyranid screams in regret for ever invading the galaxy. You don’t play as a Space Marine — you ascend to one, crushing heretics and xenos alike with the elegance of a chainsword tearing through alien flesh.

The setting? A masterpiece of gothic despair, where every ruin and skull (so many skulls!) reminds you that the galaxy hates you — and you're here to hate it right back. Tyranids swarm like they own the place (spoiler: they don’t), and Chaos whispers temptations you answer with righteous ultraviolence.

Graphics? So good it’s practically a heretical experience. My PC now has a Machine Spirit that groans every time I boot it up. Gameplay? It’s like the Codex Astartes came to life and gave you a chainsword, saying, “Go forth and do the Emperor’s work.”

Flaws? Just one: I can’t shout FOR THE EMPEROR loud enough to match the carnage on-screen. But that’s not the game’s fault — that’s on me.

If you’ve ever wanted to stand against an endless swarm of Tyranids, crack their chitinous skulls, and tell Chaos where it can shove its warp nonsense, this is your moment.

I dare not imagine what kind of disaster will appear after the official launch of the 9th

The game itself is fun. Both the characteristics of the arms and the skills, and the expertise have a certain attraction
However, there is no reward for promoting the main story.
You ca n’t unlock the level with your friends.
In disguise, players push the main line by themselves
The desire to make people want to play a story mode

The other is that the content and levels are less
There are only 6 task levels of online battles
The game itself requires a lot of farmers: professional level, weapon level, weapon upgrade material and the like
The 6 levels are really too small

PVP feels just something that is stuffed hard at all
It's okay, the production team might as well spend time to strengthen the stand -alone and cooperative content
Even if you do n’t have a plot, you can give two more maps better

The direction of balance needs to be improved
There are several options for similar weapons, but there are very few useful use
There are not much to use, a bunch of garbage guns (can be a game common problem?)
The difficulty of the level of level is to pile up the number of monsters and blood without brains.
The material you need to use the firearm upgrade should be high, but the unlimited gun runs to fight high and it will be extremely painful.
Even if it is an upgraded gun, the value of the weapon cannot catch up with the growth rate of the enemy's blood volume
If the blood volume and attack power of the enemy are 20%of the blood, each level of weapons can only increase by 10%
It is much easier to get the ordinary difficulty level with the unlimited gun to hit the ordinary difficulty level than getting the upgraded gun and the difficult level.

Additionally the TE-style red/blue rings for dodges and parrys ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ suck. It feels like a duck tape solution to their wanting to implement dark souls-esque timing requiments while filling the screen with swarms of enemies. It becomes and annoying indecipherable mess.

Oh and the ammo replenishment mechanics do not work in boss fights that physically yank your camera away to LOOK AT BIRD when your trying to replenish ammo.

JaBlue,0,144.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198195682054/,"I have 110 hours in the game and it was great until the last patch with all the nerfs. Some heavy hits are almost impossible to dodge (like the chaos marine's flame circle) and at times I get cornered and can't see because my camera's in the wall.

The bots are EXTREMELY BAD. Not only do they not target enemies half the time, but they have no abilities. Just have the bots copy whatever perks you have for that class at least. Enemy bots also focus attacks only on the player if you're unfortunate enough to play alone. Zoanthropes are almost impossible to kill when you have 2 bot teammates and only have a pistol and melee weapon (I was in a public game as Assault and my friend DCed and no one joined).

Instead of pulling a Helldivers move and nerfing the viable/fun weapons, make the other weapons better. The blocking perk feels useless and it takes too long to kill majoris enemies with melee weapons without a parry. As a heavy main I don't ever use the heavy plasma incinerator as it's slow, doesn't do enough damage against majoris+, heats up quick, and takes too long to charge. The other weapons fare much better, but then they nerfed the melta rifle, which I felt never did much damage to extremis+ enemies and requires you to get close while aiming, putting you at a much higher risk.

I don't get how a chaos marine can shoot me point blank as I'm slashing his face.

When choosing a mission, there should be an option to host or join a random squad.

Nerfing the Melta bomb by 70% against bosses defeats the point of it. Hitting that melta is hard and should feel very rewarding.

This game is playing out almost exactly like Helldivers did for me. It was fun, I felt badass, it was rewarding to know patterns, then they hit the game with a bunch of terrible nerfs and made the game more stress than fun and ruined the flow. I haven't played Helldivers much since and I'm starting to feel the same here. What Warhammer should do which Helldivers did right was that instead of making enemies tankier, they threw more at you.

Again attached lobotomized psyker, chaos-thermo-lord-wizard, references to Lord of the Rings and, unlike the first part, not fapable IG girl.
This game, apparently, enough money, so we have:
The scenery in the game is exactly three kinds again: ruins in swamps, city, cemetery in the ruins. The only glimmer of light at the very end: the ruins of cemetery in a warp anomaly.
Enemies are also of three types: tyranids, chaosites, and demon. Though for each type are drawn special, pathos-busting animations of knocking out heresy.
Weapons compared to the tabletop redesigned just to the point of impossibility: from melta made shotgun, from laska sniper, from stormbolter dull machine gun, and from the jumping satchel evil machine unstoppable imba. And they didn't let me dabble in heavy weapons

1)The game presents genetically enhanced superhuman warriors as ordinary overgrown men in sealed lats.
2)Almost the entire game, while in the combat zone, the protagonists walk around without helmets (Strictly forbidden by the Codex Astartes). The phrase of the captain (!) of the Ultramarines (!!!) addressed to the sergeant “Why do you take the Codex Astartes so seriously?” is tantamount to breaking the oath of some Creed regiment.
3)The aforementioned captain, fighting with weapons the average SM would be ashamed of, in armor less flashy than the sergeant next to him.
4)Royals in bushes the size of a necron tomb.

Декораций в игре ровно опять три вида: руины в болотах, город, кладбище в руинах. Единственный проблеск света в самом конце: руины кладбища в варп-аномалии.
Врагов тоже три вида: тираниды, хаоситы, демон. Хотя для каждого типа прорисованы особые, пафосные анимации вышибания ереси.
Оружие по сравнению с настолкой переработано просто донельзя: из мелты сделали дробовик, из лазки снайперку, из штормболтера унылый пулемет, а из прыжкового ранца злобную машину неостановимой имбы. И не дали побаловаться тяжелым оружием

Игра преподносит генетически улучшенных воинов-сверхлюдей, как обычных мужиков-переростков в герметичных латах.
Практически всю игру, находясь в зоне боевых действий, главные герои ходят без шлемов (Строжайше запрещено Кодексом Астартес). Фраза капитана (!) Ультрамаринов (!!!), обращённая к сержанту «А чего ты так серьёзно относишься к Кодексу Астартес?» равносильна нарушению присяги каким-нибудь кридским полком.

FuscusNight,1,77.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FuscusNight/,"It's pretty good, definitely not perfect as it comes with some flaws but it's a well done sequel to the first game.

Visuals
Game's visual aspect looks great, especially considering the absolute chaos you see happening on the screen with so many enemies swarming and things blowing up, with even small attention to detail existing such as the fact you get mud stains on your armour (and blood ofc) as you go through some of the marshy parts of the planet, it looks damn good but due to performance being somewhat shoddy, up scaling is needed which softens the image so people who can't stand temporal softness to an image will not be happy

Optimizaiton








I played through it solo on Veteran, my initial experience was a bit Luke-warm with the first few missions but it didn't take long for me to get more into it, especially since the campaign gets better as you progress it, early missions have this more frequent re-occurring issue that is present when you're playing solo, where certain segments feel like they're not meant for you to be on your own with the two AI partners that share a singular brain cell, such as for an example having to use a flame thrower to push back a swarm of tiny lil' insects whilst dealing with lots of ranged enemies and having to complete some objectives, problem is, the flamer takes you primary weapon away so all you're down to is your pistol for ranged enemies plus enemies in solo mode tend to focus more on the solo player than the two AI partners, so these situations can feel a bit bad . However , this starts becoming less so of a problem at the mid point of the campaign where it starts feeling like they put some more thought into making it more enjoyable when playing solo. The campaign as a whole is really damn good by the end, apart from some stumbles in design where it can very much feel like it's a Co-Op campaign with an optional solo mode from time to time, it's epic, doesn't over stay its welcome , ends on a pretty satisfying note with a spectacular final act fight that was incredibly kick a**.",2024/9/8,en
Ghost,0,50.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cjghost2000/,"Product received for free

Edit: there's been 3 updates to the game since my review, and all they did was Nerf everything people found viable or fun. Awesome don't even bother it just shows how lazy and incompetent these developers are, the little hope I had for this game is gone along with 80+% of the players a month after release.
Original Review:
I hate to leave a negative review as the game has some good qualities to it and I was excited for it, but I'm a little disappointed, it's not as perfect as people make it out to be. A lot of the issues seemed to be overlooked or not talked about. I can only hope they make changes and that it improves, as there's a lot of potential and I want it to be better.
Everything I talk about will be for PVE since I don't care for PVP. I played 2 matches and it felt like destiny 2 which sucks ballsack.
I don't really know where to begin I guess positives-
The campaign felt and played good and the customisation is good and the overall setting, atmosphere, and presentation and the monetization.
now everything else-
Most of the classes in operations, except for 1 or 2 out of the 6 feel underwhelming and unbalanced, and don’t feel like you are playing as a Space Marine. One of the two exceptions I mentioned is the Heavy class he feels great to play from the start, the other I've heard gets better is Tactical. The only reason I haven't played him is that there's no reason to when heavy can do everything and you shouldn't need to spend 10 to 15 hours maxing out a class just for it to feel as fun or competent as Heavy. the other classes need to be buffed to feel more on par with Heavy rather than Heavy getting nerfed. The other classes just don't compare and feel weak which Space Marines shouldn't.
A lot of the weapons and class perks are lackluster/superficial and give the illusion of choice, most classes are pigeonholed into specific weapons and perks and only have 1 viable primary. All classes with access to pistols and melee should have the ability to use all pistols and the knife/chainsword. Not that melee matters or is worthwhile at higher difficulties It's just not fun, Heavy doesn't use melee and is easily the most enjoyable I'm not even going to talk about how useless/restricted Assault is. Maybe bringing back health gain from executions like in the first game could improve gameplay. As for the perks you are always going to pick the ones that give you more ammo and health due to how scarce it is in higher difficulties which you need to play if you want to progress / have more fun. So there's no meaningful choices / variety or builds to be made
Speaking of difficulties, they feel arbitrary and poorly designed. As you go higher you get fewer heals, heal for less, less ammo, fewer grenades. Enemies become tankier bullet sponges and they deal more damage. It's not challenging it's just frustrating not being able to do anything. Difficulties shouldn't feel like a poverty slider that makes you weaker instead there should be more and bigger enemies and maybe deal more damage and tighten parry windows. Most of the missions are monotonous and time-consuming, so overall the replayability is very limited when there's only a couple viable weapons and classes there's no reason to use the others.
All of that is ignoring the server issues desyncing and causing other players to fly, the enemies shooting through walls and matchmaking problems, the AI being terrible and bugging out, progress being lost/reset which should be fixed in time. Some small things like the UI why is there no option to delete created armour and colour presets?, Why are settings being reset or not saved? It feels like my audio settings and motion blur are being reset every time I launch, and there should be options to disable some of the annoying visual effects like vignette and change FOV instead of resulting to mods.
Anyway it's not an awful game but I don't think it's worth $60-$100 maybe wait for it to drop a third in price or until they fix or rebalance everything and add whatever content they have planned as currently its lacking content and any replayability. I just hope the people excessively praising the game and ignoring issues realize that they are doing more harm than good. The classes, melee, difficulty levels, operations and rewards need rebalancing",2024/9/18,en

Smollett,1,120.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198144977250/,"So they don’t do it now.
Make a corridor action for 8 hours without this imaginary freedom of choice, an open and empty world or with a bunch of soul -piercing stories about each of the characters with their skeletons in the closet.
Pff.Waha is not about that.Waha has never been about all these snot.But about what Waha is shows SpaceMarine.She is about scale, pathos, overcoming and marginal cruelty in everything and to everything.
So, we have the most ordinary action from a third person.Simple, like three kopecks in terms of concept.You are the lieutenant of the cosmic paratroopers Titus and your task is to stop the investment of hostile alien beetles (well, for example) - tyranids.At your disposal - bolts of various types and sizes - automatic, sniper, and Marxman and many others.At your disposal of a chain or power sword, and maybe a hammer that can be smartly smashed by whole waves of adversaries and naturally turn them into minced meat.At your disposal, there are several types of grenades, with the help of which you can bring the light of the emperor to the most inaccessible places of enemy mass accumulations.
The fighting, at the same time, departs from the usual approach of such games, where nearby weapons are used as a last resort or for stealth.Your sword is a full -fledged type of weapons that will have to be wielded to the same extent at which you will shoot.For a variety, they added the opportunity to block and fend off attacks, which in itself is not the simplest task when you are literally anti -senior tiranids.With a successful courage, you can not only send the enemy to the knockout, but also restore part of the armor so that you can continue to fight, drive the enemies of the emperor into the ground, tear them into pieces with bare hands ... ahem ... in general, you don’t have to get bored.Enemies are just a wild amount and there is no time to yawn.The whole game takes place at a frantic pace with wild dynamics in skirmishes and there is practically no time to take a break.
But when it appears, it immediately becomes possible to admire local species.The words “gigantism” and “scale” come to mind, in fact, two more distinguishing features of the Vaha universe.The views here sometimes just amaze and always wants to stand and look for these fiery halls, churches, crypts and other structures longer.At the same time, all this is not static-something constantly flies by, someone screams, someone fights fiercely with someone.The impression of a full -scale military theater is created and it is extremely interesting to watch it.Artists and designers obviously tried to fame.
Well, we stood, examined, return to the batch and this time we pay attention to how it sounds.And it sounds juicy and delicious.The heavy steps of the paratroopers, the shots of bolter and lasganov, the cries of soldiers, the screams of tyranids - everything is voiced simply gorgeous and perfectly complements the picture of hostilities.Unfortunately, I can’t say the same thing about music simply because against the backdrop of all these atmospheric screams and explosions from music to the ears, only the sounds of backbills are heard without clear melodies, which is not bad - an ideal background for what is happening.
And finally - partners.Immediately make a reservation - the illegitar bots are stupid, like Magnus.It is extremely recommended, especially in high complexity, to get a couple of friends and then the spectacular and colorful crumb of xenos will be provided.You directly begin to feel the mutual support and shoulder of a friend in sometimes difficult battles and fights with bosses.Well, in a separate regime of pvo operations without living people and it makes no sense to meddle.These operations, by the way, do not hang apart, but pass parallel to the main campaign and complement it, and sometimes there are more interestingly what Tit is doing at the moment.There is also a PVP mode, but personally, I have never been a lover of this in the essentially games, and the match was never found once, but I will not say that I regretted it.
In conclusion, I would like to note that I have not seen so impregnated with the spirit of the forty -thousandth game for a long time.Now, if someone asks how to join this gloomy and cruel universe, the answer will be ready.There is no better spacmarin for the average gamer to date.

JohnPasSmith,0,99.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198088297868/,"The game is good, not incredible but it was never its goal.
Why don't I recommend it then?
The campaign is not exceptional and is quite short, a bit of a shame for a game that is above all solo, say ... 9 am the countryside is finished.

How to justify the price then?
Well, the multiplayer that is ... passable ...
The PVE mode which is actually the most original thing has only 6 different missions which is really a shame.
The progression system is correct but a little too long for my taste.
No possibility of creating a private part and above all, you will leave games, there are 6 classes and no duplicates.
Basically you will pray that nobody already has pick the class you want.
It's already really boring, but the matchmaking had to be simply nonexistent, there is justn't one.
You will often join a game that has already started without the possibility of choosing it or not, and in addition you will often be kick for x or y raion, in short it is frustrating.

The gameplay itself now.
A classic TPS, in reality quite disappointing for a Wh40K game, the feeling of weapons is not there, there are a total of fifteen weapons I would say, but in reality only a few are viable, we will pass the miles and one variantunnecessary bolter.
The bolter elsewhere, let's talk about it, he just does not do any damage, forced to empty a charger of 45 strokes to kill a basic monster, with a total of only 5 chargers ...
You see the problem coming, we find ourselves almost all the time short of ammunition, which greatly breaks the fun.
The body to hand now, on my side, I will say that it passes but it is far from fun to play, unlike sm1 here no regen of life and impossible to cancel in blow, in short, you will only playWith 90% of the time parades because CàC is just not a viable option since the mobs explode you at CàC.
The capacities of the classes which are but then not fun at all outside the standard, and the talent tree which is not really one, it is just passive which unlocks as you goBut which changes absolutely nothing at the gameplay.
In style, your main weapon inflicts 10% additional damage ... Far but then very far from class customization as in the Darktide which is however quite simple.
We are far from what a deep rock can offer with the overclocks that are ultra fun.

Special negative mention for waves of enemies, I explain myself, in each mission we have a phase where we must defend a place against waves of enemies, except that, unlike a World War Z where it is satisfactory becauseThe zombies arrive in a few paths, here the monsters come absolutely everywhere, we are almost instantly at CàC, there is no defense line and it is ultra frustrating.

In summary, SP2 is a good game, but far from satisfactory, I do not feel the fun that a Darktide can provide for a game that is a swarm shooter.Very quickly repetitive and accumulated with a fairly flat gameplay we quickly get pissed off.
I obviously only cited the negative points for me, although there were things that I appreciated in style animation or personalization in terms of appearance, it is clearly not enough for goodNoted the game.",2024/9/18,fr

SiMBi0ZZA,0,14.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SiMBi0ZZA/,"The review is in early access version 0.3V

At the moment, 6 hours only in the plot company of the game.
I play a couple with a friend all the time after the prologue.
But even the game in the company did not save the game ...
I will update the review as the content is developed, but for now:
1) The combat system even from the fact that it is stated very little variability and content has the number of firearms/Combo attacks,
And add to this that of the 5th automatic differences there are no facts.
Just like the combo, it is not felt as a special feeling that except PKM/PKM/PKM is not needed.
And the “nodes” that should form the nucleus of the variety is not enough, and that there is even less, because it makes no sense even purely from “I want” just a 2 -or machine gun 3 or machine gun 3, well, there are no differences in sensations.
In the prologue, the game teaches you to parry and dodge you as well as the solo of the solo of the target, but then the game will throw in crowds throwing all enemies at you without analysis without trying to create interesting situations from different types of enemies in 88%of cases, only I remembered.The location where we hid behind the destroyed statues fired from snipers, this is the only interesting situation for 6 hours of the plot (did not pass and played)
Types of enemies only 5 and 2 bosses and so 5 hours before the appearance of chaosites, which, in fact, RESKINA, the only difference between the chaosites is that the big mobs of chaos (cosmodesant chaos) are able to teleport, otherwise they are identical to their analogues among tyranides.
As a result, the mission is a series of 1 -shaped porridge of 5 types of enemies sometimes 1 out of 2 bosses appear.

Listing trifles regarding the shortcomings of the combat system can not be enough for a review for a long time.

2) the plot is as if there is no Titus, all the characters besides the Titus of a dummy of neither a character nor a person, no interesting dialogues or kitszen, chemistry between ordinary and title in the 1st part when they argued on Astartes Code more than chemistry between Titus and all characters2ki taken together, and this is not hyperbole, just in this scene in 1 chemistry there was a conflict that laid the foundation of the plot, and in 2 there simply no plot or dialogues of any interest in the narrative, drama is not familiar to the developers of the game from the word completely.
Even when there were times when you expect the most logical paths in the framework of the situation, they were not.
It seems that the whole plot wrote and directed the neural network, and once again it is not hyperbole, this is 1 in 1 so.

3) I have the optimization of iron above the recommended, I am not a stab me, I am not a graphodr () I put it on low schedule.I have 2070Super/i5 9600/16ram 3200. And at the same time, I have FPS stably jumps from 40 to 60, and I understand those scenes where a large location is a bunch of enemies and allies, but why does the FPS fall in corridor locations?On low.
Low, my iron 4 years ago was the forerunner Consider especially Vidyakh, and here the game that does not stand out at low ones falls into the FPS, and in some places the Federal Penitentiary Service fell up to 16 Tsati, I'm afraid to imagine what kind of slide show on minimal specified requirements.

I still have a lot to say but not fit in the review, but I voiced the main claims.

If you are far from wahi and you do not care about the canon, for you this is just a casual bad game with low variability and a yawn plot.

If you are assigned a 20 -year -old exposure like me, who has at least 200 hours of podcasts listened and reading/codes, it will hurt you from nonsense on the backing.

And if you are a hired expert Back, take care of your heart, I'm afraid to imagine how it hurts you.

Do not buy a game for a full price tag, you do not miss anything without playing it, you should not take this game for less than 75%of the OV, although even so it is not worth money, it is better to go on import substitution.

And I will continue to play to create a video of the review, I will suffer for you ... PAMAGE Q ... Q ... Q ...",2024/9/11,ru

1. PVU and the plot campaign: they are played just perfectly, when the hordes of xenos are spinning on you and you and your brothers destroy them with packs, this causes ecstasy, especially when you all almost died, the boss Fitites are good, various and dilute the gameplay.
2. PVP: Good Rubilovo between the players, simple modes not to be taken, playing is played
3. I did not find serious bugs or lags during this time, except after loading at the control point of the characters, the voice disappears into several replicas, but what is most annoyed by this long downloads (I hope the release will be faster)
4. If the game develops like on a roadmap that they introduced us, then he will be fucked!
In short, the game is fucked up, and even more fucking if you play with friends (if they are).

ObDivanKenobi,1,36.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/obdivan/,"As Rogue Trader, this is the best RPG by Warhammer, so Space Marine 2 is the best action by Varhammer.The atmosphere, production and art are simply gorgeous, all this is done with maximum love for the original source and from the first minutes immerses in the atmosphere of the world of eternal war.
Play strictly with friends in a cooperative, or in a low complexity - and the Bolovniks are precisely that the blanks are only suitable to raise you if you fell, and you will be very often in the solo, because there will always be a lot of enemies, and they are painful.

Gameplain is all exactly - the guns shoot, the weapon of near -battle beats, the enemies are beautifully scattered into spare parts - but nothing more.This is a purebred old -school shooter even without pumping.

The main drawback of the campaign - it is criminally short, for 10 hours. Apparently in Saber they studied complaints about the monotony of the first part and solved the problem radically, the campaign is so short that the monotony simply does not have time to manifest itself and get bored.

The PVE missions (separate from the campaign) are beautiful, pass on separate specially collected maps and will not yield to the campaign in the production.Plus, pumping appears in PVE.There are exactly two shortcomings: on high difficulties with random Sopartians (or even more bots) there is absolutely nothing to do, and there are also few of them, only 6 pieces.

PVP ... it is, it is command dependent because of the high TTK and it is ill with non-core problems (high ping, Desing).Behind the lack of alternatives, it will fit and can even be funny, but because of the command dependence and lack of rebalance, you can easily get into the cycle of endless defeats.

------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, the game, despite the fact that short, leaves much more emotions than the faceless open worlds for 100+ hours, and definitely costs its money, especially in a cooperative.

LionSaurus,1,87,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005529409/,"Solid enough game - it does what it says on the tin - be a giant super human and smack bugs around. Story seems fun so far, operations are good (but with a caveat) and I like the melee and gunplay. After some more time in the game (both story and operation) I can delve a bit deeper into things.

Story - 7/10. It's pretty straight forward, though there might be a twist or turn in there (that I'm sure you have already gotten spoiled through various news media anyway). Not much to say. Simple, but cool.

World building - 10/10. Top marks. The maps, the battlefields, the chaos, the swarms, the absolute gore - it's just fantastic. It's beautiful and disturbing and just beyond anything I expected. Game teaches you about the 40k world and the immersion it provides gets you really stuck into it making you want to know more.

Gameplay - 9/10. Gameplay is marvelous. Though I'm still struggling with the timing of dodges and parries I've occasionally gotten in a flow where I just become a blender, chopping xeno scum to the left, doding xeno scum to the right, and firing of headshots as quick reaction. I for sure need to get better at the combat flow, but I can easily see how good it can be if you get good at it and once you do it's going to be euphoric.

Operations - 8/10, but with a caveat. The mainstay of the game in my opinion. It has huge potential and even the little I've played is so much fun. It reminds me of the golden days of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer (if you know, you know). However the biggest issue is playing without a full team - because you are stuck trying to connect with random players and that is it's own bag of worm. From people with bad connection, to people who won't go to the mission area, to people who just afk. I honestly prefer having bots over the random players, but unfortunately you can't choose to add bots - you have to hope nobody tries to join. The fact that we can't add bots makes me want to subtract 2 points from the score on it's own because the issues with random players can be very aggravating. They need to add an option to add bots..

Endless War - haven't played =p Might try it some day, but not a big PvP so - check others opinion on this game mode.

Would I recommend? I think, yes. If you enjoy the concept of loop gameplay from operations, and you have a full team (or the devs add option to add bots) I think you will have a blast. I know I will once I'm done with the random player issues.

Oh, and a final note. Stay away from the ultimate edition and cosmetic DLC's and all that. Even if you pay for it you still have to unlock it. So you buy for the right to unlock the cosmetics, but you still have to spend requisition on it which takes super long to grind. My biggest regret is paying for the ""cosmetic options"" I don't have enough points to unlock lol.",2024/9/7,en
WiseGuy,1,364.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wiseguy99/,"Review has been edited to reflect the recent changes made at time of writing. To see the original negative review, check the bottom of this review.

Well I'll be damned. They actually managed to dial back enough changes to make the game a blast to play again. Combined with the new buffs to bolt weapons and friendly AI damage against bosses, I can safely say that this game has earned its place back among my go-to games to play. I still have a few gripes, like how the AI uses its abilities (or doesn't) at inconvenient times, but they are ultimately outweighed by the enjoyment of the game-play itself. I can't wait for the new weapon and what else is to come in the future. As long as they aren't updates like Patch 4.



Original review:

I used to love this game to bits, and the Operations mode was something I would play daily. However, the recent patch has made the mode practically unplayable on higher difficulties. Many minutes are wasted by slogging through a mission with wave upon wave of Warriors spamming projectiles at me, only to die near the end when the game decides I don't deserve to be rewarded for my time and kills me by sending 15 Warriors and a pair of Zoanthropes.

Helldivers 2 showed you how badly you can ♥♥♥♥ up a game when you decide to make it harder when it is already plenty difficult, and Saber Interactive decided to follow it as a tutorial. Ironically, Helldivers 2 is now it a better position than this game, and so I may decide to spend my time with it instead. Very disappointing.",2024/10/20,en

hampstr,0,5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hamataro/,"Product received for free

Early negative review: seems like if Gear of War if it didn't have a shred of humanity, and looked really good. It's middling in a lot of ways, and the one way it is exceptional is that it is like Zoolander: really really really ridiculously good looking.

Graphically demanding, and while it runs fairly well, it has an upscaling menu that bears some dire implications for the future of graphics (AI upscaling presented as balanced option, native resolution presented as ultra-premium quality option).

Overheats your PC for fairly basic gameplay. Guns are good, slightly underwhelming, melee is a very lightweight system with a dash of Arkham and not particularly deep. Could be that it gets better, but I'm not in any hurry to find out. Once again, it feels like Gears of War but with the armor system replacing the cover system. Not in love with the tone, it's very self-serious and dire and slow, and you run into a lot of characters that are just so flat and one dimensional. Not much popcorn appeal there, but it's also hard to take with any gravitas since the game is just about big silly action figures ripping apart lizards.

It also lacks the mortality and urgency of Gears characters, since space marines are basically invincible superheroes in their universe walking past expendable nameless IG that they'd be willing to sacrifice without a second's hesitation. Grim, serious (verging on joyless) invincibility fantasy is just an odd wavelength to try and play along with in a basic TPS.

Adammaniaco,1,108.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061793951/,"I preordered the 100-euro version after knowing that Saber had some ex-Bungie employees, and oh boy do I not regret it. Some of that classic Halo DNA must be in this game, because I wasn’t so hooked with and online PvE mode since the original Halo ODST firefight mode.

Without taking into account the excellent campaign mode (LEAD ME TO THE SLAUGHTER) and the PvP, I’ve already sink +100 hours playing Operations Mode in all difficulty levels. Each time you finish an operation, you get points, new armor, weapons, perks and more. With 6 classes and their distinct playstyles to level up, the amount of content included in the base game is insane, every post-match customization had me building different Space Marines of all aesthetics, colors, chapters and combinations imaginable.
Since I started playing, I went to my family’s house to retrieve my old 40k minis (Black Templars and Tyranids, very appropriate), read +5 novels (The End and the Death and the Ravenor trilogy), visited my local Games Workshop retail store (first time since I was 16), and purchased and started painting some new Black Templar units (the whole Primaris upgrade is new to me, the minis are quite bigger).

XMarkos,1,42.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/markuno/,"Pros:

1) A very beautiful visual, you can look at everything for a long time and break the F12 key.
2) Colorful finishing and for each weapon they are their own.
3) The crowds of tyranide are stupidly fun.
4) The characters in the company are registered quite interestingly for super -war in armor, who know only the war.
5) compared with the first part, both shooting and the nearby are strongly pumped.To shoot and beat very colorful, the difference, in fact, is also felt between the dacks and between the little girl well.Power sword - One Love.
6) Coopeous missions are directly related to the plot, so you understand that everything on the title did not agree and not only can be relying on it.
7) The plot can be held in a coop.

Cons:

1) The game is quite short, you will not come in it for a long time
2) there is no finishing from the back, as well as, let's say, from above.
3) with the introduction of chaosites, the crowds disappear, which is sad, they are generally sadder than tyranes
4) From the game classes - only a different set of spacmarins, nor apothecies.You won’t meet a librarian here (there are no problems for me, because it was a point in showing that “just marinchiks” were not the same)
5) only six coop missions that quickly bother.
6) There are simply no cosmetics on chaosites, but there are chaosites.

Adds:

1) In the game of critical bugs, I did not see, occasionally there are drops of servers, but as if yesterday it is not even the game is to blame, and Steam dropped.
2) I ran to the multiplayer a little, but you can catch my buzz in it.By itself, it seems to be quite distinctive and balance.
3) There are trunk abilities in the coop that make some (almost all) classes too strong, for example, endless ammunition on heavy weapons.I hope they will be recorded soon.
4) As a visual, there are open elements of the armor, each class has its own final look, in general, it has come to me, but you don’t really go for a lot, yet the code is important.For example, from the bastion (with a shield he runs and a police, as a rule, a sword) here is almost all of the armor with a cassock.This has dark angels in Back, the black templars and the honorary guards of Ultramar.All colors can be taken in the game.Generally.You can paint it in any color, but you either have almost standard armor, or with a bummer.It's just that at least a beautiful armor is stupid without a cash.About the same thing has a sniper, he has the majority of the armor with the winding of the Legion emblem, and as a result, the Maskhalat is completely.Really beautiful and in all details, the armor has heavy support, but the meaning is clear.

Bottom line:

I would be afraid to give advice “buy right right now!”, But, if there is an idea to buy, then you won’t spend money in vain, the game itself is good, just far from perfect.",2024/9/18,ru

ChronicNerditis,1,40.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066256617/,"Simply put: This game is extraordinary. Not only is it visually stunning and highly immersive, it is a game made for the target audience through and through. Loved every minute and can't wait for more after 9 hrs of play.

The story is rich, the characters are well done, and the atmosphere is palpable throughout the campaign. More than anything else though: Space Marine 2 is a game that makes me feel like I was heard. The game stays true to the core of 40k and incorporates much of the existing lore into an amazing rendition of that world.

The combat system takes some getting used to but it is akin to Helldivers and Gears of War blended with a somewhat ""Souls-like"" play style. Dodging, timed strikes and blocks, run gunning, and simply brute force are all options. Different combat strategies are rewarded differently with different enemy types and I enjoyed the challenge. On Veteran difficulty you absolutely have to be more careful and consider what enemies you are fighting our else you will get absolutely mogged. The combat is addictive and exactly what I think of when I read a 40k book. The flashlights are also fairly lore accurate which is awesome haha.

I highly recommend this game:

Pros:
-Fantastic landscape and world design. Highly rich environments with stunning visuals and details
-Plays fantastic. The combat system works great with minimal bugs and the game appropriately rewards strategy
-True to the lore and ties in nicely with the original game
-Very palpable passion in the writing and development. This game was made for true 40k fans and new fans alike. It leaves you excited to play again.
-Great PvP and PvE coop options

Cons:
-Audio bugs for me have been most common. Muffled audio randomly after cutscenes or death is my most frequent bug but even then are not persistent and resolved with rebooting the game.
-I wish the campaign was a smidge longer. I got a solid 8hrs out of my first playthrough on veteran, and I stopped to look at things and explore the NPCs conversations as I went. This is somewhat made-up for in the coop mission mode.
-Some of the enemies are serious bullet sponges and when playing solo campaign the enemies tend to target you far more than your NPC allies. Normally this would be ok, but when cooping the enemies target everybody in a more balanced way and that did make the missions more enjoyable simply because the mobs don't drown you in harass on top of tougher enemies.

There are also some obvious areas where the game can be expanded, and I really look forward to it.

I have not yet played the PvP heavily but in the brief time I did try it I enjoyed it.

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you are a 40k fan this game is worth every penny of full price. If you are a Helldivers/Gears of War/Halo fan you will probably love it too, and this game makes a decent into to 40k but you will have to google some things (Such as Space Marine structuring and who the Emperor is, but don't worry YouTube is rich in lore vids).",2024/9/15,en

Combat has weight and impact to it, the marines look good, the tyranids are relentless and the corridors and areas feel atmospheric. I mainly have small complaints like that bolters could have a little more punch to their sounds, blocking being a little confusing at the beginning and the menus being annoying to navigate with a controller as the cursor slows down A LOT on some UI elements but it sure does feel good to just have a game you can just play for fun without much modern nonsense in the way of just playing it. I'm also enjoying the photo mode.

I do have one big complaint already which is that while playing the campaign alone I almost lost one fight due to lag. Felt really odd and kind of sad that otherwise such an awesome fight was rubberbanding severely.

This game is certainly not heresy for the license. FOR THE EMPEROR!",2024/9/11,en

I never expected a sequel to one of my guilty pleasure games but I'm so happy it exists! This game is such a huge improvement to the first one. The story was so fun and soooo sick. The addition of easy drop-in, drop-out for co-op was fantastic. Visuals were wayyy better than I expected and might be one of the nicest looking games I've ever played (at the time of this writing? lmao).
The only gripe I have is with the lack of information presented for pvp. It took quite a while to get into my first match and I had no idea if I was actually gonna get in since it gave me no indication besides ""Waiting for other Battle Brothers"" in a full lobby. Turns out I was waiting for the match that I joined to end... I think. It would also be nice to have one sentence explaining each of the pvp modes. Switching armor parts instead of choosing a chapter was also confusing.

Shrimpy,1,94.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040086041/,"I Like it but thats not the whole story..
Space Marine 2 is well set in the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K. As a continuation of the OG Space Marine Game from 2011, it attempts to bring the one-decade old formula of bolter shooting and chainsawsword slashing to 2024. However, it struggles to do so and is very expensive on top. I really enjoy playing the game and will most likely cotinue to play it. But it has some notable flaws and if you are thinking about buying the game you should consider the following.


If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k and a sucker for the (totally not overrepresented) Ultra Marines, its a awesome implementation in the Universe.
The game is a well representation (even if a little generalized) of the lore and atmosphere that makes up the core of 40k for me. It allows you to stomp Tyranids and match yourself with . In the Coop PVE and the PVP mode, the Customization System allows you to tailor your Character into your favorite Space Marine Chapter or Chaos Legion. The Lovecraftian horrors of the 40k universe are well-represented, making the story engaging despite its somewhat bleak plot and dialogue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, if you're not deeply invested in the 40k Universe, Space Marine 2 falls short. The gameplay feels outdated, with clunky mechanics that haven't evolved much since the original game . Combat can be fun, but it's often repetitive and lacks the refinement seen in other smilar modern titles. The writing is another weak point, with dialogue that ranges from uninspired to outright poor. Online multiplayer is plagued by long wait times, frequent connection errors, and bugs that, for example, can make enemies invisible (very fun), breaking immersion and gameplay. The game has a very hard time to offer anything beyond its niche appeal, making its steep tag hard to justify for newcomers to the world of 40K aswell as casual players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Space Marine 2 delivers exactly what I want out of a Warhammer 40k game: a grimdark experience in a universe that lacks hope with the permanent thread of extinction for a human race lost in endless external and internal conflict. However, it struggles to appeal beyond its core audience due to outdated gameplay, technical issues, and blunt writing. If you're a diehard fan of 40k, you'll find enjoyment in this game despite its flaws. For everyone else, who just want to stomp some Aliens and blow up stuff, there are better and less expensive options.",2024/9/11,en

A distinctive feature of any game for me is a gameplay and here it is below the average.Maybe because I played at normal it seemed to me.Fortunately, the game passes in 10 hours maximum.In the end, of course, you accelerate and you are already quickly pressing the ksenos and chaosites on the quitim, even starts to like it.

But I would like the depths: unique finished off, skills, passwinds, even the tasks of the type kill 200 opponents from a fighting knife - all the same 2024 in the yard.And how many noticed the game was made according to the instructions of 2010.

But what is actually good in the game is the cool setting.Katsen and rollers at the proper level.The story is unpretentious and simple, but at the same time it is capable of captivating.

Trendered so that you are immersed straight.I would like to yell in the battle ""In the name of the emperor!"", When you go together with Astra Militarum into battle.With take the adept of mechanicus for swagger.

Companions are registered heroes, not blanks, which pleases.You even get to them.

The plot of my reverence and the elderly pleased, continuing the old convoy about the artifact.And with a fanbase, showing tyranids, the combat equipment of the imperium, chaosites, and Necron ruins are flirting.And to beginners, too, it seems to be more or less clear what we are talking about.The base is in a word.

Cartoon, well, he is.Why?Well, to those who are not enough wiha in life, probably.

Justro,1,23.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slayerjustro666/,"This is by far my GOTY contender for 2024. I will not argue with people who don't agree for stupid reasons. The story is so stupidly incredible and epic. It fits perfectly for a Warhammer 40k game. The gameplay can at times be a little yanky and rough but is for the most part perfectly great and fun. Ripping a tyranid open from the middle and being drenched in its blood never gets old.

The operations game mode is so much fun, playing as my own space marine completing missions really is amazing. Even replaying the same missions doesn't get old.

The pvp game mode is the best pvp in any game I have ever played. I never liked playing pvp until I tried it in this game. However it is a bit unbalanced as some classes are absolute dogsh*t in pvp. Or at least on some gamemodes. I'm sure it will improve.

The customization is incredible, all that I am missing is more customization for heretic factions, which I don't doubt will come later considering how many people want it.

The only complaints for this game I have seen are: No widescreen support (Which will come to the game in september, just check the roadmap) , Oh I don't wanna connect to epic games services (Doesn't make the game bad, and is only there so you can play crossplay), The AI companions are so bad that I can't play the campaign solo (Literally a skill issue???)
This is finally a game that is not pay to win and it is clear that the devs reallly care about the game. In my eyes this game is joining baldurs gate 3 for being an actually good game in modern times. Yes some cosmetics will cost money, but all other content coming to the game is free. So people need to stop complaining about this game, because it is simply breathtaking.

In summary, this game is worth every penny. I bought Ultra Edition instead of Gold Edition even if it only gives me a cool cosmetic for Ultramarines (and I really dislike ultramarines) but I still don't regret it. I would have bought this game if it cost $150 base edition. Good that it doesn't but still, It is worth the money to me personally. Now keep in mind, I love warhammer 40k and have done for a while so I am a bit biased. But for a Warhammer 40k fan, this game is like the game of my dreams. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? BUY IT NOW!

- Inquisitor Titus Drake

In my opinion, Space Marine 2 should be evaluated in two planes - directly as a game and as a product in the universe of an endless war.

With confidence, we can say that at the moment, in terms of visualizing the Vakhov’s aesthetics, all this “Bolter Porn”, pathos overcoming and other attributes, to save Marina 2 is the best representative.For a fan and a person at least more or less interested, the game is simply a real gift.Artists perfectly coped with their task.Architecture, interior design, elements of armor and weapons.Did you want to see in all its glory the legendary Baneblade?- Please.Maybe the titan of the ""Emperor"" class?- Hold!True, with some reservations, but still!Shoots shoot, hammers moorly moan, and harsh soupovars carry the emperor’s light and quotes from the kids, brother.Here the game is 10/10 completely deserves.There is not enough epic scope.

Reflections give rise to heresy.The heresy gives rise to retribution.
- Epigraph to books about Gregor Eisenhorn

At the same time, the design of levels and some mechanics of the game send us right from the threshold in the 2000s.Frankly admitted such linearity and invisible walls, literally a couple of meters from the only way forward, I have not seen for a long time.Field good QTE in place.It is also worth saying about the choice of complexity.The game does not talk about this anywhere (even vice versa, misleading), but the last two levels of difficulty, obviously balanced under the cooperative, not under the solo passage.2 Bolvanchik is not completely useless, but in the hardness, their sympathy is simply not enough.Therefore, if you play one and want to keep your nerves and positive wibes, do not build daddy, choose the first two.
The campaign on average passes for 6-8 hours.This is quite enough.It is knocked down tightly, in terms of the ratio of events, diversity, epic and some kind of philleric moments.You will not have time to get bored.
The fact that the life will extend the project is the PVU mission and PVP content.From the PVP, it takes Oldskuly.He is very primitive and sends us to the time of Kweik Arena and Anrian Thornation.Against the background of other competitors, a retro fan is very much.But Pve is a local pearl.Here, unlike the campaign, there is also the choice of classes, pumping a character and weapons, the choice of perks and a detailed customization of everything!You can blind yourself your favorite bloody crow from childhood and steal at the Timmates, for example, a first -aid kit from under the nose.All according to Laura!By the way, there are only 6 missions. Although they are very diverse and even surpass the campaign in some places, this is catastrophically few!Their reigree is exactly until you pump your favorite bolt screw and open a cool element of armor.In fairness, the developers promise to tightly support the game and add a bunch of content in the future.Be it new missions, cards and modes for PVP, as well as cosmetics.Separately, I want to throw a stone into the garden of non -car and masticing.They are disgustingly implemented.Endless loads from each action at the stage of selection of players.You can throw you into a game with a person in the same class as you and you will have to either change it or go out and wait for loading again.There are frequent cases of breaking the connection, and it is no longer possible to return to the game.

This game has so many little details that have made me and my friends stop and appreciated them (not mentioning which in order to avoid spoiling).

The gameplay is visceral and responsive, simple to pick up but with some dept to it.
The lore, according to my more learned friends as I am but a novice in the 40k ways, is very good, and they took great care with some details.
And the graphics are beautiful, the contrast between the amazing visceral displays in combat and the beautiful but war thorn landscape around is amazing.

This topped off with non-predatory monetisation, only cosmetics can be bought, and even then there are plenty to earn in game, the future updates are free and will bring so many wonderful things is such a breath of fresh air.

From the experience that started playing since Day 1 ** Model in advance **
This is an adventurous action game that shows the best role at this time. If talking about the advantages and disadvantages of this game:

strength
- Graphic system: Step ""impressed without disappointment.""
Due to following up from this game announcement, including the Demo gameplay system advertisement
This is ** the first game in my life. ** I feel that there is no downgrade.
""How did Demo come !!The real game comes like that !! ""

- Story system: There is a lot of Hype.
The team did the said system.In a very large scaleMake players feelThere is a mood with the game easily.

All forms of fun
The team did the homework very well. With the form and theme of this universe, all came.


Definitely not disappointed, intelligent and challenging
As the same team as Crysis 2, Killing Floor 2 and
See the name and know

Decorated until it was flawless
Very diverseIf anyone is already a fan of this universe already, say ""Fin, like*2""

Like watching a movieThat we can control the characters
""The sound of guns and ammunition at the enemy's body"", ""The sound of a sword at the enemy of the enemy"", ""
Including the voice of the characters that are emotional with the event
Everything

This game has a Thai lecture system.Do not worry about translation in all situations.

:
Although the universe of this gameIs definitely greater than helldivers 2
But the story system of this game that emphasizes that there are still only the Tyranids tribe
On the other hand, helldivers 2



When playing for a long timeWill start to feel boredBecause the mission is still not diverse enough
(Depending on each playerAnd wait for the next update)

There are only a few, such as sponsoring the enemy, etc.
(But it is considered very few in Day 1 if compared to other games)

There is a good translationBut still not excellentSome words are used.That does not match the situation
Such as military vocabulary, tactics, sentences or idioms that should be
(I would like to admire the team very much and hope that this component will be useful to the team in the development.)

- If going to play this game: emphasizing that according to the System Requirements
(Personal experience is open, the story is outstanding, the game is completely out of the game)



But if anyone likes Heavy Bolter Skin + Ultramarine Skin
Plus 300 baht to get Ultra Edition

If anyone is waitingOr decide this game

ICShields,0,24.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023836949/,"Overall i have to say that in general it is a good game. It does a lot of things right. At least the launch wasn't scuffed like darktide's launch was. Plus i don't have to fiddle around with graphic settings to make it not run like the biggest laggy ♥♥♥♥♥ of a game i have ever seen.

Yet....there just no real substance to the game. I'm completely honest here, for a game like this. I am totally fine with the story being short (roughly 12 hours on veteran) all good.

BUT the big thing why i can't recommend is that the PvE is just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lackluster. 6 missions ? That's just not enough at this point. To really have a good rotation you need at least 10 missions. Then the fact that some classes are heavily limited to weapons.

The idea of their difficulty scaling is literally making enemies bullet sponges.
Thats just not good enough and only ruins the game when even the useful weapons aren't enough to pose a real threat to the enemy.

I don't play PvP so i can not comment on how this aspect is.

They also have a road map that should feature a horde mode. I mean....a horde of bullet sponges ? nah bruh. Its a good idea but with the current way the difficulty scales its just not something i could see people enjoying a lot. I'd rather have 4 new operations to freshen up things plus a rework of how difficulty scales.
Mix in more majoris or make random hordes appear at some point. But don't give them more health.

Also PLEASE for the love of anything that is holy and under the protection of the emperor, the one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing he doesn't protect is your server connectivity. I can not tell how many times i don't even get matchmaking going and then the game tellse me that the connection is not working and if i wanna play offline. Like WHAT ?! Holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sigmar. I am waiting longer for people to join my lobby than it takes me to finish 3 operations. How is that even possible ?

Ai_shuang,1,32.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198286835015/,"Today, in 2024, the IP of War Hammer has spent decades like the history of the whole video game. In the process, many types of games of the Warhammer series have also been born, such as the full war of war hammers, the doomsday plague,, Dark tide and so on.As the level of the standard gaming industry, this Star Warrior 2 has also set another major tools for the Warhammer series games.I have to say that the IP of the Warhammer is very lucky. Regardless of the subsequent operation of the dark tide and Star warrior 2, the overall quality of the game is really high.



This interstellar warrior 2 points into 3 modes. The battle mode Players play the Tempus team to end the enemy's conspiracy in the 8th war.Different tasks of the same battle are performed. This model has a professional and weapon RPG system, and it also undertakes the elements of brushing in the game.The last is a PVP mode without numerical growth. The built -in level is only used to unlock weapon use permissions.



The overall design of this game is actually very traditional. The three modes are completely separated. Each performs its duties.As a result, when I encountered an accident and entered the story of this article, I became a small captain. There were two less obedient teammates who performed a variety of smaller tasks in the big events.At the same time, each level is plugged into some big scenes and multi -performance scripts that are increasingly rare today.In the process, the protagonist and teammates were slowly displayed, and finally faced a decisive battle in the face of the big crisis.This is also a feature of the old ASS game. Even if the process is spoiled before the game, when you really play, you can still feel excited and trembling when you hear these things, these characters, these large -scale scenes happen in front of them.



At the same time, there are many classic interpretations of the Warhammer's series in the battle. Players who are familiar with the IP are afraid that they can already imagine the development direction of the story before they start, but the plot of the masterpiece who has never been exposed to the war hammer is also very simple and direct.It is very eliminated by the previous cause of the consequences. There is no need to buy novels and comics to understand the plot's riddle design. There is no great understanding of the cost. It is very friendly to outsiders.For Hammer's details, the game is full of details. For example, in the process, the door that the star army cannot be lifted by the Star Warriors will make the Hammer smile, and this performance can be in other players.Simply see the strength of the protagonist.



There are also various classic war hammer links, such as Qibing, Guishan, a classic plot: The Extreme Legion of Grand Rican in the genetically preliminaries, the ICU war god, the blue man, the whole galaxy of the Galaxy,The hardest man, the electric pole holding the space of the space of the space as a weapon, the dry explosion of Tyron's nest owner, the one punch to kill the god of war, the two punching Angolas dog meat, the two hearts of the chaotic sacred place, the super rush man——Aarga!(His stretcher team) debut!Single -up!




The sense of blow and control of the game itself is also very top -level, so that players really think that what we control is a 3 -meter -high super brother, whether it is the walking posture caused by the huge armor or various melee weapons to fight on the Terlen Zerg.How powerful can players feel how powerful our fists of these 300,000 horsepower are.
The game itself's combat system is also very unique. The advantages of playing games such as wolf are integrated into this game. Of course, if you play with key mouse and mouse, you must change all the keys except WASD.In the battle, we have two explosive shotguns and a melee weapon to reduce the blood volume of the enemy to a certain degree after a certain degree.The invincible state rushed up to perform a happy execution animation, and a very good setting was to cancel all actions and shake before execution.At the same time, there is also a player mechanism in the game. The enemy attacks two types: red and blue. When you are attacked, you will see a blue light effect first.Anti -success, the middle judgment frame is relatively abundant. In addition to a few consecutive attacks, we need to play twice, at this time we can shoot directly into the state of the gun, but since the gun decision is remote execution, it is also reasonable to delete the invincible effect.EssenceAt the same time, the point that is not mentioned in the game is that the red attack can also be perfectly dodge and then the gun decisions, and all mobs attacks in this game can be played. Therefore, theoretically, it is theoretically. In theory, we can only use melee.Still my round battle.



Then other designs determine that this set of mechanisms cannot run perfectly. For example, the cost of a worm in the Terren worm is not as expensive as a bullet.When the soldiers surrounded the surrounding enemies and the long -range soldiers that could only be resolved with guns, they also used a bouncing knife in some gaps.Although it is easy to bombs, it is also necessary to consider the risk of failure. In the game, players' attacks and attacks are too hard, and often face the surrounding situation. No matter what difficulty, sometimes a operation error will be dead.This has also led players to rarely use this ability without proficiency.



However, the game itself is very encouraged to fight. Our interstellar warrior first has a shield. No matter what you execute, you can directly reply to the shield.After the shield is broken, the blood first is the deficiency blood. Similar attacks with the blood can directly reply to the deficiency blood, and the deficiency of this game is one to one and the time is not short. Sometimes you hit the mob in the strange pile.How much I sucked back.



However, this game has stuffed a lot of long -range monsters in the level of the level, allowing many of the above -mentioned combat methods to lose room, and the long -range monster attack frequency and accuracy of this game are not low.However, there is a setting to kill the long -range elite. The mobs next to the mobs will die by themselves. However, this tutorial is hidden in the PVE character challenge. At this time, the production team may be the hammer.The younger brothers around the big tools will die.



And the production team fills the value with the foot. At present, some weapons are very balanced, and the hot melt is destroyed. The energy weapons in the world's view are effective in this game.The most difficult monster giant meat, AI and AI during the war of AI, do nothing, but 80%of the injury reduction can not die.However, the battle is generally recommended to play low difficulty, which is also in line with the intensity of the original star soldiers. After all, there will be no other rewards except for achievements.If you really want to challenge the difficulty, you still go to the PVE mode. After all, PVE must be difficult to upgrade in the future. Do not start the battle directly to the jail like me. In this process, you will also appreciate the script performance during the battle.



The production team of the level design is still more in the zombie world war. Many levels have a very strong sense of vision. Generally, it is not very good, and the level is quite satisfactory.However, some level design is a bit dung. For example, there is a level in the middle that needs to be held by Peng Teller to defend in the mouse pile. In the case of a huge long -range monster, you need to use the fireproofer to burn the ground from time to time to place the mechanism.The name AI teammate is even more painful. AI has nothing to do. The output and the header can only be handed over to the player themselves.




The rendering style of this game is very unique and incomplete, especially the armor of the Star Warrior, which is more like using various shadow spraying and making old battle flags.Look at it for a long time.In PVE and PVP, players can also customize armor. At this time, the color of the game civil war group is consistent with the color name of the flag paint in reality.Maybe this is also a business strategy, but in general, it is not bad.



However, some issues of this work are also introduced here. At present, the first version of the battle and 6 levels of PVE, each level is about an hour, and many colors of custom armor need to spend the game in the game for purchasing in the game, and the game of the game, and the game, and the purchase of the game in the game.This token demand is very large. At present, the content of 6 levels in the area is really difficult to support the players' long brush, and the follow -up armor style of each occupation in PVE needs to be unlocked.If you want to unlock the full unlock at least 204 PVEs, this is really exaggerated. Obviously, unlocking the armor of each occupation into a general can reduce the amount of more than half of the content. Unfortunately, the production team did not choose this.



The PVP of this work is more traditional, nor is it the focus of the production team. Many functions do not want to do it. For exampleYou can also wear a shield directly. Generally speaking, the depth is not high, but I am more worried that when I play PVP on the first day, I encounter plug -in. I want to report but find that there is no report method in the game. I encounter this situation.You can only choose to exit, but there is no punishment for exit.It can only be said that the little blue bear specially added by the production team is not very useful for this PVP. After all the dust is settled, the PVP should not be played by everyone except for everyone.



However, it is worth mentioning that after experiencing the dark tide, I first had high expectations for the music of this game, but after the actual opening of the game, you asked me the music of Star Warrior 2. I found that I couldn't remember what the music of this game was at all.It looks, but the sound effect of the relative game is very good. The large -caliber of the shotgun is a large -caliber break, and the impact sound of the internal institution of the firearm.There is also a very detailed place that players can choose whether to bring helmets in the settings, which will also directly affect the role dialogue sound effects.



In general, this game is a very standardized product of the game industry. It has normal level design, a more unique combat system, and lack of combat design experience leads to a slightly higher strength of the long -range mobs.At the same time, I have invested more compromised resources, and there should be a real hammer to provide ideas in the production team. This resource is really spent on the blade.Perform madly; know that if you do n’t do much, then stack the relevant design densely within 7 hours of the battle; know what the hammer wants to see, then focus on this aspect;, Show the whole story in the eyes of the player in a very clear attitude.This is very valuable in today's European and American game industry.",2024/9/8,zh-cn

Been playing for 2 weeks and was hoping the new patch would fix this issue. If you que with a 2nd person you will never find a 3rd person. Its a known issue all over forums yet they just released a new patch and didn't even try fixing it. If you solo Q you might find a 2nd player, and then end up with a bot. If you play with ur friend and u have a bot as 3rd player, its going to be tough on the higher difficulties. Game doesn't have much end game content, just 4 levels and 6 separate operation missions. End game content is lacking, campaign is short, campaign you don't even get to level up or use different loadouts. The loadouts are only available in a separate mode. Gets repetitive with no real differences. But not even being able to play with battle brothers or constantly glithcing and having to play with useless bots. Whats the point of this ""brotherhood"" game when all my brothers are bots? Don't get how SABER has not even attempted to fix this issue last patch OR is aware of it!

NOV 20/2024 They fixed matchmaking not as buggy. Game is a bit easy, on the hardest level difficulty LETHAL mode, you get some skins that show you beat all of it as bragging rights or honor. For how massive the lore is for Warhammer and how epic the brotherhood is. Feels like the reward is lackluster, needs something more cooler for the achievement. Glowing helmet, or a diff color, or something, its just a scratched helmet that u can barely even see unless you are right beside a brother... Lol. Expected something much more EPIC.

Marines do not feel that powerful, missions are just repeat of the same thing like 8 times. The game feels slightly unfinished currently, and I regret my purchase, at this moment",2024/9/23,en

-Awn the dead deafening blows, which lost their individual key and the subsequent STOMP attack when repeatedly used, and, most pleasant, which now restrain the enemies worse.An elite mob can simply be replaced, or, like a small mob, to use an attack that cannot be canceled with charged attacks (so the deafening blows from Origanal are now crying).
After all, now the battleship is built around such a game tumor as a parrying and counterattack reinforced shots: this is the insuluration of the personnel, and the stunning of the crowd, and the best way to commit special finishing, which is the only constant method of the Soustin of the resulting damage.And all this with the wise buffers in the worst tradition of sausages.

Pros:
Fluid and satisfying gameplay: fighting the hordes is satisfactory, with a mixed mix between body brutality and adrenaline shootings.The use of weapons and skills is very intuitive and does not require demanding mechanics.

Cooperative mode: playing with friends adds a note of greater fun and more strategy, perfect for dealing with the most demanding missions.

Promising post-launch support: with a community already passionate about the universe of Warhammer and/or newbies players who want to know this world, the improvement potential can be very high for future updates, DLC and additional content.
AGAINST:
Limited exploration and a few really immersive maps: personally, I think the game is often linear and you do not have the opportunity to freely explore the surrounding environment to discover secrets, additional details on the Lore or, more simply, unique objects to collect.As for the scenarios, however, I expected that some maps were more Creepy and treated to a Grimdark context.",2024/11/29,it

Titus is alive!
From the release of the first part, long thirteen years passed, but the developers did not spit on the story of Titus and returned it to the universe again.After the accusation of the Inquisition, the captain is lowered with the rank of lieutenant and sent to lure sins before the Imperium of mankind in the guard of death.The successful completion of the next mission, almost at the cost of his own life, opens the hero back back to ultramarins.After returning to the landing detachment, the body is pumped to Titus - now it becomes primaaris.
The developers worked well on the plot and provided a full -fledged, coherent and understandable story about the once beloved character.It corresponds to the Laura of the Universe and may interest a third -party player.But not in everything - fans know the features of the origin of the Ultramarins detachment and will definitely pay attention to one detail in the Titus team.But watching the events is quite exciting, especially with love for the universe.Throughout the campaign, players will have to participate in several dangerous missions and fight with numerous forces of hostile fractions.
Unfortunately, gamers unfamiliar with the original do not feel the connection of the protagonist with the original story and may be lost in some conventions of the world.Despite such a feature, Space Marine 2 will definitely please lovers of dynamic shootings and cooperative battles.It is in the gameplay that the main power of the project is.

""Waha"" - how it is
Earlier, I already mentioned the direct continuation of the events of the original, but it is worth noting the exact hit by the atmosphere of the entire universe.Brutal brutal battles, rivers of blood, hard hierarchy and following Laura - each fragment of the game in detail conveys the world beloved by many fans.Following the primary source is noticeable even in models of characters and a huge set of options for performing armor of heroes.
Space Marine 2 will definitely enjoy detailed effects, background images and environment.The design of the locations came out corridor and understandable for study-it will not work somewhere to get lost, a marker or a crowd of enemies running out of Titus, will tell the right direction.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is filled with an epic, colorful and endless shootings, brutal action, blood rivers and a campaign filled with events.This turns out to be quite enough to immerse the player in the setting and allow him to enjoy the atmosphere of cruelty and injustice in the world.

Pros:

-Dalized world with a realistic atmosphere;
-Dynamic shootings with crowds of opponents;
-coloring effects and animations;
-Brutal and bloody action in the spirit of Warhammer 40,000.

Cons:

-the lobe amount of the ""endheim"" of the content;
-At the basic skills.

PVP:

As a player in the PVP, it became boring quite quickly because of monotonous and mirror cards, although the game does not position itself as a competitive one.I would like to add some events or destruction, since the conditions during the game do not change in any way, Mesilovo 6 to 6 quickly bothers.

1. It is not a mechanism that people can come up with far away. I have to stand with my teammates with my teammates?
2. If the content is not enough, it is difficult to pile. N4 and N5 are the gap between cliff -like. N4 is killed casually. N5 can not be hit without shields and grenades.
3. Fix your error report and the problem of the server drop. If you do n’t encounter three times a night, I think it ’s the emperor blessed me.
4. The most classic Star Warrior is the shotgun and chain sawing sword. A good guy burst a shotgun to hit a magazine. It is not as good as a grenade.I can crack, I seem to see it in a strong place
5. Sniper ammunition is not enough, and the tide cannot be cleared and the elite cannot be cleared. The only role is to kill brain insects. Now you have to stand in the strange pile with your teammates to return to the armor.Do you really play games?
6. Playing N5 Jia is the same as paper, and you have to stand together to return to the armor. Then the problem comes. All the long -range monsters are like a Wendica assassin.IntersectionTo cut it for a long time and cut it out, you have to get rid of his teammates and take a risk to take a bath in the risk. Melof -combat damage is not as good as remote. It is better to delete melee.
7. Originally a semi -finished product, the content was seriously insufficient, the price was sold so expensive, there were many bugs, the server was poor, the drops and fires were serious, and the balance of occupations and firearms was also a rare.This is PVE not PVP!What we want is to play with each profession and every firearm weapon!

Titanic bump,1,64.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031770795/,"All readers fiery hello)
In short, I recommend this game, I liked it and I do not regret the money spent.
Disclaimer.In the review, an amateurish attitude towards the universe, simple mistakes, etc. may be traced.This is due to the fact that I am simply interested in the universe and solvent to buy this game and high.There is no desire to plunge in detail into the universe, although it is cool.
And then let's go in more detail.
For some reason, it was precisely for this game that I wanted to leave a review, since the game is not quite clear.
Let's start with some context.I am not an ardent fan of Wahi, with some details of the Universe I am familiar, but those of the vidos on YouTube :) I have not read books, I played a little from the games in Boltgun and Inquisitor - Martyr.
But the universe is pretty to me.I also played a quite a lot into the past creation of Saber, wwz (to which there will be references in this review).
Let's start with a brief review of the game, based on my subjective perception:
Pros:
- The game is a beautiful, very pleasant visual design.The location design is simply amazing.The cities of the hives, directly are admired, for everything is just huge.
- The atmosphere is perfectly conveyed.The gloomy 40s of the millennium, in the universe where the war lasts forever, is just transmitted perfectly.
- Respect and love for the universe.It is felt that the developers really respect this universe.Because even under the hardest control from Games Workshop, you can make a low -quality product, the benefit of such varnish games that are a lot of Steam on the bottom.As an example: according to the plot, one of the secondary fighting brothers receives a severe wound and throughout the plot, somewhere in the background of the hub he is prepared to become a dreadnought.
-Himepley against tyranids.I really like to fight these opponents.Moderately complex, there are a lot of them and enjoy the coolness of your character.It is felt that we are perfectly weapons in the hands of the emperor of mankind.
-I really liked the chip with the separation of the campaign and the PVE missions.From the point of view of the narrative, they go in parallel.
-PVE mission, they are also operations.In fact, I bought the game only because of this mode.Since I like wwz, then I expected approximately the following:
Classes with unique abilities and weapons, crowds of enemies and coop.I got all this and is generally satisfied.Well, pumping, I like this aspect that you play for something.
Cons:
-Sester state of the game.I do not know what exactly happens, but it happens that it throws out of the game, does not connect to the lobby.Not so often happens, but when it happens wildly infuriates.Such a problem was in WWZ, so I got used to this problem a little.
-Himepley against heretics. This is not a minus right, I just noticed that of all the operations, I play only in those where tiranids are opponents.The gameplay against heretics becomes more tactical, so you have to switch from the berserker regime.
-Thisly minus, this is a balance.Apparently the core of the game was implemented operations.For there the balance of opponents and classes is simply perfect.As for the campaign, it feels that it is made using the same approach, only you do not have classes and does not pump the weapon, which sometimes raises questions.
-Covering the PVE of missions until you go through the plot.Well, this is a minus personally for me, as I bought a game for the sake of operations with friends, I immediately had to go through the plot.Such a small restriction was slightly disappointed.
Summing up a brief resume through this game:
This is a magnificent game in the Warhammer universe.Probably the best in which I played.And just a good game with your nuances.Do not buy it thinking that she is just like HELLDIVERS 2, these are completely different games that give completely different emotions.If you like games with progression, excellent visual style and a minimum entry threshold, then this game is for you.If for various reasons you do not have much time for games, and you love them, then this game will certainly give you excellent emotions.Especially if you play it 1-2 hours a day.Just to relax.Want to get a call, you can simply go to higher levels of complexity.I definitely recommend this game to buy.I specifically do not pay attention to the price, because everything is now expensive and while you think about whether this game is worth your money, you just won’t get the right pleasure.So try to immediately forget about how much you spent on it.",2024/10/18,ru

Within its first hour, Space Marine 2 hits all the right notes and gets you pumped about the journey ahead. The first thing you notice is how magnificent the game looks and sounds—not just on a technical level, but also in terms of art design. I’m glad that this aspect remains consistent until the end. However, in terms of gameplay, things are sadly not looking so good. At first, the combat feels crunchy and fast, almost like a third-person Doom, but as time goes on, the downsides become more pronounced than the positives. After only a couple of hours, you realize how restrictive the level and mission design is. Additionally, the encounters start to feel superficial due to the lackluster weapon design. Almost every encounter can be easily completed with any of the weapons, which lack identity; as a result, you, as the player, don’t feel in control of the combat—you just go with the flow, shooting mindlessly with a couple of melee combos and finishers here and there.

The story is mindbogglingly simple, but the performances are strong, so the game doesn’t feel entirely lifeless in that regard. It’s also surprisingly a direct sequel, both in terms of story and spirit. I’m pleased that a change in development studio didn’t result in a soft reboot.

All in all, Space Marine 2 is a marvelous technical and artistic achievement; however, it fails to deliver as a compelling video game. I have only played the single-player campaign, so everything I say is directed at that aspect.",2024/10/17,en

SinpaiKuronan,0,53.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116989715/,"I won't deny that Space Marine 2 has some awesome moments (namely, any time you perform an Execution) but it's developers make a lot of decisions that chip away at my patience or otherwise confound me. I'll put a full list below, but some of the major ones are just a lack of cross-class weapon availability, extremely stingy use of I-Frames in a game with a lot of animation locks, and gating progression behind forced difficulty increases.

I also don't like Classes, but that's entirely my preference and I understand that's just how Monetization has decided Modern Gaming is going to develop.

1. Every class should be able to use every sidearm. Canonically, these are all Ultramarines, so you can't use the excuse 'well, different chapters learn different skills!' they are all in the same Chapter, and while I can generally forgive things like Heavies not getting Melee Weapons or Snipers locked to Knives, this is one thing I take major issue with.
2. No Automatic Sidearm at Launch? My trigger finger is getting enough exercise to lift a Bolter Pistol, and I am not a fan. Please add a sidearm that I can hold down the trigger and spray into Tyranid hordes properly.
3. Experience and Currency rewards are absolutely pitiful on Minimal and Moderate. I often won't even be able to afford a Color Pack after a mission on those difficulties, nevermind weapons. I can forgive putting my nose to the grindstone for class experience, but considering that progression is tied to unlocking and mastering weapons (which requires currency to buy every version of a weapon) this isn't okay.
4. Far more egregious is that Artifact and Relic Artifact Data is locked behind Substantial and Ruthless Difficulties respectively. Do you want to progress past Tier 2 Weapons? Well, your options are A) Tryhard, or B) Uninstall.
5. Speaking of Armory Data, it's not guaranteed for completing the mission. One has to be found in the mission (it is guaranteed to spawn, but ) and the other is from bosses that potentially spawn in the mission (but are not guaranteed, and also might coincide with the Horde Timer.)
6. Certain areas are basically guaranteed to Horde, which works heavily against it. Decapitation's Chapel is the best case of this: You can fight a Horde right outside the transition door, kill every Tyranid, enter, miss and then have to fight It's an extremely confined area which makes it even worse.
7. I-Frames are only built into Executions, like five frames of a successful Parry, and half of your Dodge. Most animations otherwise don't even have Hyperarmor, meaning you can get knocked out of your Stim, or you can start a Gunstrike instead of Parry and then get stunlocked and destroyed.
8. Ai cannot be assigned classes in Private Lobbies, nor can they be assigned specific weapons.
9. It's freaking 2024 and Helldivers 2, allows full remapping of all buttons on both Keyboard and Controller, what excuse does Focus have that I can't manually map my Melee to B/Circle button?

Focus recently released PAtch 4.0, and after an extreme amount of backlash, released 4.1 which removed nearly everything we hated from 4.0 (which was basically the whole thing, minus the introduction of Lethal) so the Developers CAN change the game if we demand it enough, and very quickly too.

This is an Old School shooting game that we've been playing since many years ago. The mood is similar to Halo. These are good games, fun, challenging. The story may be a little confusing.What is it?Arrived and flirted, we immediately threw into the game.But if you don't look at them, this game is a very enjoyable game.The more you play with friends

The second part for 40k fans
This is the Space Marine game you want.You will see the coolness of Captain Titas that has returned to Ultra Marine again.Saw that Marane fought with the sinos and the trendy(Personally, hahaha)
You will also see the coolness of many characters in the story that, despite the little script, but appeared to create an Impact to a certain extent.Although the story is short and may not be satisfied for the fans and the villains that are a little too small, but overall, the game is good to buy.

I never understood why 40k unbridled Fantasy so brutally, and although I ended up in love with this new IP, today Fantasy keeps a special place in my heart.

I met Warhammer 40k later than soon, and it was not until the great Rogue Trader that I really understood his world.When the original Space Marine came out, 10 years ago, I still didn't know the delirious depth and darkness of this universe.

Today, with more knowledge about Lore than ever, Space Marine 2 looks like a double gift down from heaven;An unconditional love letter not only for the old lovers of the dolls and the battles at the table, but also of those who miss the type of video games that were made at that time when the important thing was to reach your target audience andDo not fill your pockets with absurd monetizations, cosmetics, refritos, rotten crossovers, all the racial and invent-sexual deployment of the great average American city and other postmodernist garbage.

Space Marine offers us a campaign that 15 years ago would be considered another of the pile of great quality playable experiences, but that is unfortunately a breath of fresh air in an industry that is increasingly cannibaling itself and constantly bites the handThat puts food on your table.
Additionally, it offers 6 extra missions from a group of parallel marines in which you can customize your own personal spots with the colors of the chapter, weapons and armor that you want, while offering infinite rejugability by uploading each of the very different classes.

Finally and also important, Space Marine 2 offers us an experienced player against a somewhat limited player, with a couple of maps and a pair of ways, in which a sea side faces another from Marines del Chaos by theGalactic supremacy.Although with signs to be expanded in the future, this mode offers a very satisfactory gameplay drinking from the traditional multiplayer arcade -type Call of Dutyto see Niky Minaj or Messi sausages in a servoarmadura.

To put the icing on such a juicy cake, the company's very CEO left a comment in an Asmongold video pointing its fed up with the despair of corporations for introducing moralistic policies in their products and advocated a future in which video games returnTo be like yesteryear, designed to enjoy and appeal to his audience and not to serve her.

Space Marine 2 feels like a game of 10 years ago- an affirmation that ten years ago would have a negative nuance but today, in the middle of 2024, unfortunately it is music for the ears of all those who enjoy the medium as conceived.

Positive points:
+ Very good quality graphics
+ Dynamic and aggressive gameplay, offering a real feeling of power, with a good dose of gore
+ Excellent soundtrack

Negative points:
- few missions available
- Some missions are too long for my taste: they can last more than 45 minutes to 1 hour.I would have preferred that they were divided into two shorter missions, because it is not practical when you don't have as much time in front of you.
- Bestiary and slightly limited arsenal
- Too many unnecessary interactions, like those to do just to get into an elevator
- enemies shots pass through certain objects
- The difficulty could be better balanced: instead of simply increasing the HP of enemies, transforming them into real ball sponges, it would have been more judicious to increase their number and their variety.(it's very badly thought out when you face several powerful, spaced enemies, which shoot you at a distance)

Edorian,0,14.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Edorian/,"Wide as a puddle, deep as the same puddle, with more padding than a Primaris Power Armor, and yet only amounting to an 8-10 hour campaign with maybe 4 hours of actual gameplay.

Please don't buy this at full price.

This would be quite a neat, if dragging, experience for 15 bucks. Asking for 60, or even 90 or 100 bucks for this is, frankly, insulting and shows how desperate people are for good a 40k experience. Sadly, this one ain't it.

For what's actually in the campaign:

You're jumping in the role of a grumpy, whinging, military door technician role playing as one of the Emperor's Chosen. During your fights with all of 8 types of enemies the game has on offer, next to its 3 bosses, your main job is pressing door opening buttons waiting for elevators.

Combat difficulty mostly revolves around avoiding getting pelted by ranged combat damage while trying to get into melee range, where the spectacular takedown animations and the mini-cutscene camera work really shines. Melee combat is covered by invulnerability and regeneration granted by these extended animations, i-frames during dodges, and a parry window wider than the greatest stained-glass displays in the Cathedrals of Terra.

Between combat encounters, you're walking down narrow, samey corridors with a ton of buttons and objective markers. There is always one way forward and one little side area, sometimes two, that contain an extra med pack, ammo pack and combat boosts. But don't fear, there will be an objective marker at the ready telling you the way forward, and which button to press for the next line of stiff dialog.

The campaign is a formulaic low engagement spectacle, dragging from vista to vista, where the characters in the cutscenes get to have a lot more fun and do way cooler things than what you're allowed to do in game.

Your “always ready for coop” group of 3 Marines, with our main character Primaries Marine, the flanked the jealous upstart that we'll grow to love over the course of the move and the placeholder personality and is also around for other to say lines at.

These are not the transhuman weapons of destruction, sworn to the will of the Emperor, and imbued with their 22 or 19 gene-seed organs respectively. This is Sergeant Jake McMuricaMan and his squabbling Band of Brothers, more devoted to human infighting about rank and questing orders than to carry forward the will of the Emperor in their Call of Duty. The plot might as well stem from one of these shooters.

The combat loop, when the game actually hands over controls to you, is split up 2 to 4 minute encounters in a contained arena. Each fight is followed up by 3–10 minutes of walking around, watching cutscenes, holding “forward” while more drooling placeholder dialog dribbles as you press some elevator button, and then finally arriving at the next small combat scene. But not before you're promoted to press the ATTENTION button to make sure you're not missing the highly scripted vista waiting for you. This Disneyland approach to level design can work out great for spectacle fighters, or depending on the difficulty you pick, walking simulators, but falls flat here as there is no overarching narrative or story being progressed. Just another power generator that needs turning on, another door that needs opening, another obstacle to walk around. All while the most impactful and coolest moments of the story happen off-screen.

The fact that the avoided having chest high walls and a cover bottom is the only concession made to modern game design on display. This small grace helped it feel at least a bit like 40k and not like the Gears of War cover shooter it felt like most of the time. You still get your fill of invisible walls blocking your every movement while the game is busy acting out its budget Hollywood movie that you get in the way with your desire to play it. Most of the areas could as well be wrapped up in yellow and black “STORYLINE — DO NOT CROSS” tape.

Now take your Medal of Honor and leave, Doorfighter of Ultramar.

---

Oh wait, we also shipped with Multiplayer! As all game executives of the 00'ths have taught us: Every shooter needs a multiplayer!

Multiplayer during the campaign seamlessly replaces one of your AI companions with a player. A neat system that, apart from some net code issues leading to desync and teleporting, works most of the time. Post campaign PvE content then is replaying 6 pieces sliced from campaign maps over and over again to gain XP to level up each of the 6 classes. All in all, a very simplified version of coop games like Warhammer 40k: Darktide, Deep Rock Galactic or Helldivers. While it feels thrown in to justify the horrendously overpriced experience, it does allow for a more combat focused experience with fewer story exposition and waiting segments, which is welcome.",2024/9/30,en

Campaign: Well paced plot is easy to digest and has a solid ending. Final boss fight is awesome with lots cool moment throughout.
Operations PVE: Lots to grind for and feels fairly challenging for progression; was hoping their be more than 6 ops, but they have promised more for free with each season.
Eternal War PVP: This mode unfortunately feel like it got done last minute. The game modes there are fine, but there's only 3 maps with spawns being terribly setup and classes definitely having balancing issues. More maps and mode have been promised, but balancing will come with time.
Customisation: There is tons to unlock for each class with plenty of colours and emblems to make whatever marine you can think of. That's at least for the loyalist astrates. The traitor astrates however suffer from same thing as pvp part of the game, probably cause they were done last minute as well. The armour is locked to a set class with only colours and emblem being changeable.

Overall an upgrade to everything in the previous game beside the pvp aspect at the moment. With plenty more content coming down the pipeline I'm sure it can only improve.

リカン,0,188.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198871762460/,"It's time to write a review. The main problems of this game:
1) Connection - constant connection errors in the ""eternal war"" mode, in particular problem 140, when you have to re-enter the game several times before all the stars align in the sky and you are allowed into the match, instead of being offered to go to the main menu once again . After which, by the way, nothing will change, you will still have to restart the game, and so on several times.
2) Chaos marine customization. We have a fairly rich customization for Loyalists and such a poor one for Chaos marine. Why are Chaos marine each class tied to a specific legion??? Why are there so few armor parts for them??? There are no my favorite ""thousand sons"" (Although they were in the main campaign of the game. Is it so difficult to integrate ready-made skins into pvp mode???). In general, Chaos marines are represented by a small number of legions, but where are the individual warbands, which are so numerous in the Warhammer 40k universe??? Here's another thing: Have you ever seen Berserker Khorne without a chain axe??? - and here you will see.
3) Class system. I will not say that some classes are completely unplayable, or become more or less playable only after opening some items. I have a completely different question here: Why does a game like ""Total Tournament"" or ""Quake Arena"" have a class system at all??? And the classes themselves do not inspire confidence: if the ""Night Lords"" still look in place, then Khorne berserkers in the form of a non-assault class are nonsense. Let me remind you that Saber ""presses so much on lore in its communications with the community"", for example, they have already answered the question: ""why is each legion of chaos tied to a specific class?"" - because it is according to the lore, and right then we see the berserker Khorne, who is clearly out of place. If you follow the class system, you will simply have to enter 100,500 thousand classes for each type of space marines, and then you will have to make 100,500 patches to balance this whole thing. I think it's easier to introduce a system of factions (legions), for example, you choose a legion to which specific types of space marines are available, and that's it. By the way, does anyone know why class experience in pvp mode??? (so I have classes that are developed to level 5, but how do they differ from the same class of level 1???)
4) I think it is no longer a secret for anyone that in the future it is a game service. Please remind me of the fate of most such ""new generation"" games))) I understand that all developers want to put their games on the ""monetization rails"" as soon as possible. I think at the stage of loot boxes with a small chance of dropping rare items, it will be possible to put the game on the ""Steam shelf"" and never come back here. I pre-ordered the max edition because I believed in this game, but if at some point I'm offered to buy skins and loot boxes in a AAA-game that's actually being sold instead of being offered for free, that would be a ""slap in the face"".

P.S I am giving a negative rating just to draw attention to the problems. The game is actually pretty good and has a lot of potential.",2024/9/20,en

I'm to simple man, I came to kill bugs and fuaa, it's incredible how it is enjoyed at all times.It is funny and frantic, and mission after mission the epicity amounts to peak that are the last hours.A jewel.

I still have the PVE and PVP modes (I don't feel like the latter, more out of curiosity), but I ended up completely satisfied with that campaign.

UPDATE: After more than 50 hours, I got fully into the operations and eternal warfares.The PVE is a delight, there are seven missions (to date) that have a lot of rejugability and they had a lot of fun in the highest difficulties, and even more so if one varies between the classes to try different game styles.The PVP on the other hand is OK to play a couple of games and now, I wanted the fact that it takes a long time to find games and, when it does, it almost always sends me to USA servers giving me high latency xD

Some weapons were not embarrassed by parameters (power fist), for some reason they took the opportunity, especially it was important for the devastators, to go into evasion during the “included” sight, you cannot start finishing in the sight of the sight, it is absolutely not clear why they spoiled the attack aircraft, who needs it.These kuldowns and freezing to think with the fall point in eternity.Absolutely disgusting cute fighting, it seems that we can spoke the attack, but this does not give anything, the enemy continues a series of attacks, it is easiest to dodge any attack if it is a small enemy that can be canceled with this, panicers from a pistol are rare, except for the framesInvulnerability, they do not carry.The attacks of the enemy do not interrupt the attack, we can only be introduced to the enemy into the light stegger.In the first part, the bolters carried impact due to the abundance of ordinary opponents, who quickly and picturesquely died under the flashes of the detonations of mass-reactive shells, here the usual Horoga-Correne or thermal Education can be paused several hits, deaths are lost in the crowd.5 varieties of ordinary bolts were lost in impact.

The dumped, patented horde technology has the same problem in the director's approach as the World War Z, we have an integral event, we are not the main part and the part is not the main one, we are dangling somewhere on the side.It seems that we are shown a giant horde, a general battle, tanks go into battle, the infantry is lining up in orders from dioramas, Astra Militarum supports the platoon of the 2nd company of ultra -harsh, but it simply leads us to the pocket of more local events, the general battle addresses the players only in the playersIn one mission of special operations (PVE of missions).It seems that we will even find ourselves in a general event, but we immediately leads us to another pocket and we go to beat three cripples, instead of a large -scale vagrakalov’s face.

Pow content with 6 short missions, for some reason there is no survival in a separate mission.
PVP Classic Trileine on small teams, I did not even go into other modes.
The pumping suddenly turned out to be divided, which differs from the first part and does not contribute to enthusiasm.

In general, the delight and positive emotions from the plot and pve received, the money was repulsed by 11/10, but with such a gameplay, linger longer than I could play, it will not work, a little sorry.

TheGoldenWallcreeper,1,21.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037181089/,"We have some kind of Warhammer holiday occurred with the release of this game.Personally, I liked everything about it:

- Very beautiful graphics with good optimization, despite everything that happens on the screen.The guys promised a huge number of models that simultaneously act on the screen in order to display the scale of the swarm of tyranids - and they did it.
Plus, the developers with great respect for the Laura showed beautiful, large -scale locations in the form of a combat barge, imperial cities - something like this you imagine when you read books on Vahe.
The first game in which I wanted to use photoregram (and I did it).
And how the armor of the space marines are drawn here - this is a separate high.It can be seen that this is really the armor of the warriors fighting centuries, all in scars, potholes and other marks of complex battles.This is amazing.

- Music.Everything is very good with her.

- Gameplay.I am glad that I chose not the maximum difficulty, because even on the penultimate ass, it was torn off so that some parts of the missions had to play 5 times until you pick up the key (or you simply do not post the CP).Although the final boss was given from the first tray.
In general, a good shooter / slasher, with understandable shooting, with a good impact and a variety of weapons, each of which is played differently, which cannot but rejoice.

In general, my soul, devoted to Varhammer, pleased as much as possible.From the plot, from symbols (separate and large like for them), I caught an orgasm several times, especially at the end.The last time such emotions were only in the third metro.

But the rest ... The obligation to redo the campaign when it has already been done in coop with colleagues, I do not see the principle.No history of the checkpoints of the different parts (countryside) that we were able to do.

The Space Marine bots are useless apart from revive with 2000pts of HP #Gadrielpower.The campaign is linear a shame when we see what other Helldiver studios do, Fallout ... The universe allows, it looks like the recipe for Space Marine 1 which we just revised the copy.

Not to mention the multi with ""exploded"" matchmaking.Who you put 3 levels 20 in front of 3 levels 9 ... because yes it was not easy enough to make the Rank apply to our whole unit?And whether the experience of the game or rather the story is more interesting.

> The assault: 3 blows of energy hammer to kill a scout ...
> The sniper scout: 3 balls to kill a guy ...
> Devastator: Incredible
> The tactic is well balanced astonishment

And to finish the IU in the game ... As much the design is top but you make a coop game without making a clean in-game social menu, we are struggling to invite friends to play is laughable.Call me to make a real ux it's my taff.

Frankly the W40K universe has so much potential, you are using barely 10% and again in a logic of play 10 years ago (PVP, Match, Campaign).It is sad for my taste, why not take up the recipe of Helldiver by going further with the races of W40K, invasion, planetary countryside see galactics etc ... with a choice of ""races"" of W40k that could be embodieddepending on the wishes of each.",2024/9/19,fr

Leonell,1,57.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120082889/,"As an aspiring fan WH40K, I am very happy with this game.
Pros:
+ Campaign, short but full -bodied and very addictive.Interestingly written characters and many moments in which they were breathtaking.
+ Gunplay for a very big plus.We feel every shot we give, we feel every hit in the enemy.The fight with white weapons is also very satisfying.Finnishers are a fairy tale and they never get bored.
+ The audio-visual setting is amazing.The amount of details on armor, buildings is huge.Also sharpening all this is refined to perfection.
+ Optimization, playing on RTX 3070 and I9 12 GEN, in no way I experienced FPS declines.For me plus, but I don't know how it is on other players' equipment.
+ Diversity of weapons.The arsenal is really substantial and you can match the class that interests us and weapons.There will be something for everyone.
Cons:
- Few of these PVE operations.I know that they are directly connected to the story, but unfortunately, there are too few of them.
- Gierek is rather to play for 1h, max 2h and then you have to take a break, because its repeatability is very high.Even changing the class to another does not help much.However, in my case there is a great desire to return to playing after these 2 hours.
- There is no distinction between the history of the Order that let us call it that.My friend noticed me and it actually started to disturb it a bit.By coloring the black Templar or a cosmic wolf, we still get dialogue issues of ultramariners.Unfortunately, this is a minus related to the fact that operations approach the story.I hope that this will change in future seasons.

And that's it on my part.

The campaign, while short, is a breath of fresh air when it comes to story-lines. The voice acting is perfect. It has one of the best representations of the WH40K world and most importantly, the Space Marines and the Imperium of Man. The storyline is simple but executed perfectly. The characters are simple as well, stoic, stalwart Marines who will risk death for their fellow brothers and their mission, and that's ok.

The devs and Saber should be proud of SM2. It's a return to classic gaming and what makes gaming fun. There's no hidden agendas, narratives or overt political messages shoved down our throats. There's no overly complicated characters with a plethora of problems pouring their hearts out and whining incessantly about how the world is against them. It's a simple storyline about brotherhood, duty, loyalty and just your basic good vs. evil. So refreshing.

Buy it. It's worth it. The campaign is gloriously fun and gets your blood pumping with the amazing cinematics. The multiplayer is addictive and isn't overly grindy. You truly feel more powerful as you level up. I look forward to new missions, enemies and PvP modes.",2024/9/18,en

Here are the ingredients you will need!

Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.

Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.

Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.


1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.

2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.

4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.

5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.

6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.

7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.

8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.

9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.

10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.",2024/9/18,en
