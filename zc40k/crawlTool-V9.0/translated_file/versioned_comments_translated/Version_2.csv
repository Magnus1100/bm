The game continues with Titus, the hero of Ultramarines.Titus joined Deathwatch to pay some kind of penance after the events he had experienced in the past, and now he is again between Ultramarines.The story begins with the Tyranid invasion, and at this point, you experience the phenomenon of ""a Space Marine who knows nothing but war"".Titus's story is almost a mythological expression of war and heroism, but frankly what we call ""heroism"" works a little different here.Heroism is mostly based on defense and destroying the enemy.

It is incredibly satisfactory to control Titus.Each step is shaking the enemies, every stroke destroys them.The game is forcing you to stay awake against your enemies.Because it's not enough to be strong, it is important that you timing and escape.Especially defense against the moves of the Tyranids keeps you awake in the game.

Warhammer remains loyal to the universe, game graphics and sound design is really impressive.They have implemented the miniatures of Games Workshop.Every enemy, every environment, as if you have jumped out of your desktop game.In the middle of the war, as the gothic structures wandered, the atmosphere really draws you into it.




The three-player Co-op mode is absolutely successful and if you have friends playing the game by entering the mode, the PVP mode is the feeling that the Space marins are well balanced and play Gears.



Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a good experience.It is a perfect refreshing both for new ones in the Warhammer universe and for old fans.The depth of gameplay, the atmosphere of the story and the quality of multiplayer mode, this game is one of the memorable games of 2024.If you like action, strategy and some dark science-fiction, you should definitely try this game.Satisfying, exciting and a beautiful work that will accompany you on your return to the Warhammer universe.

+Saber Interactive, Warhammer unexpectedly committed the universe well
+The feeling of stroke and the weight felt while walking is excellent
+Crowded scenes and large -scale Kadaku landscapes are very successful
+Parry and somersault system well fed to the game
+The dimensions and behaviors of the characters are investigated attentively and made correctly

No longer do I wander in the shadow of ignorance, for Space Marine 2 has torn asunder the veil that clouded my mortal sight.

With each righteous strike of the chainsword, I felt the will of the Emperor coursing through my veins. The xenos or the heretic—none can stand before the might of the Adeptus Astartes, and now I, too, feel the weight of that sacred duty upon my shoulders. Every battle is a prayer to His undying majesty, every victory a testament to the purity of the Emperor's cause.

In this game, I learned what it truly means to be a warrior of the Imperium: to purge the unclean without hesitation, to stand unwavering in the face of annihilation, and to know that failure is not an option, for failure would mean the death of mankind itself. This is no mere entertainment—this is an initiation into the sacred brotherhood of those who fight for the survival of the Imperium.

Space Marine 2 is not just a game—it is a revelation, a holy writ in digital form, and a reminder that we must be ever vigilant, ever faithful, and ever ready to cleanse the galaxy of those who would defy the Emperor's will.

AnFbiAgent,1,93.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1supersecretagentman1/,"I think the game is great, but has a lot of design flaws that can definitely be fixed in a couple months if the devs are paying attention. I understand they had people to please by releasing it this early, but it could've used more time in the oven, as a bad launch can really sour a game's reputation (looking at you Darktide). I'd like to get my grievances out of the way before I name the positives.

Firstly, requiring internet and server connection for a game like this feels strange, and the enemies are definitely tied to the servers as they lag around if the connection is acting up. And not having some basic matchmaking functionality is very strange on release. You can't choose lobbies, you can't choose to host or join them, and you can't opt for a solo run; even worse, there is ZERO reconnecting to a match if you aren't playing w friends. If you get disconnected due to their server mishaps during a quick match, you lose your potential 30 minutes of progress. And on top of that, there is no kick prevention late into a match, so if you really wanted to kick at the very end, you could.

Second, it has terrible optimization all round; it loads horribly slow without an SSD, I have it on an NVME and it still loads slow sometimes. Performance feels really really low for a lot of systems that should run it at a steady 60 FPS no matter what. I have a 4060 ti and it definitely doesn't keep 60 FPS, it routinely drops to 40, not to mention any mid-range systems that can barely run the game in certain scenarios.

Third, is the combat system. It ALMOST feels good. Small enemies tear you up way more than they should ever, armor sustain feels weird in it's current implementation, and so does HP sustain. The whole bloodborne rally mechanic is fine, but there is almost no way to sustain HP outside of the overheal bug, and Apothecary/Bulwark's ultimate ability, 99% of the lobbies I queue on Ruthless difficulty do exactly that because of the current balance. You should get a 5% heal for majoris executions and 10% for extremis, and like 15-20% for terminus. That and the loadout drop pods should heal you to some degree. Armor should have to chipped away by small enemies, it should not be that tyranid warriors are less scary than a group of hormagaunts or shield tzaangors. And we should be able to animation cancel into a dodge roll from any animation, at reasonable frames, as well as cancel into a parry on certain animations. Parry into dodge roll should feel fluid too. being locked into things feels pretty awful sometimes.

The good stuff here has serious potential. The combat when it DOES work, feels awesome. There is a flow state you can find yourself in if the game is really working with you. The inspiration from other games really works with the way they constructed the game (save the dodge roll. Astartes would not GoW dodge roll, the Bulwark side step looks apt though), Between the Doom executions, the Gears of War combat style, and the spawn waves akin to the Tide games (elites, mini bosses, specials, chaff units. Which itself is inspired by the slightly more basic Left for Dead formula) they have something truly addicting with how it handles skill expression and SOMETIMES, difficulty. I like this game, but I would love it if they made some seemingly easy changes. They have the framework up already, so if they really care about their players, they'd make some number changes. Combat is a super easy fix. Matchmaking too. The optimization might take them longer.

Overall, get this game if you think it looks fun, but only if you have decent internet, and an mid to high end PC.",2024/9/16,en

The emperor, the talent, the virtue of the saints, the courage of the warrior, the wisdom of the wise.At the beginning of the Tyra, it was the hometown of human beings. After all the difficulties, it was difficult to flatten the enemy, and finally built the Great Wall of Human beings.His ambition is not only to conquer the territory, but also the place for human beings to survive. Following the fire of civilization, in the endless darkness, the Bright Avenue is opened.

The territory of the empire is vast and vast, spread throughout the galaxy.Wan Xing is like a torch, all of which are under its governance.His soldier, known as Star Warrior, was wearing a heavy armor, holding a sharp blade, without fear of life and death, and vowed to fight for the emperor.Whenever the war, I will go forward bravely, and I am invincible.The spirit of its spirit is just like steel and indestructible.

The virtue of the emperor, widely set the universe, and its grace is like rain to moisturize all things.Under its rule, the people were able to live in peace and work, and soldiers were able to report to the country.The law is strict, and the reward and punishment are clear, so that people's hearts are attached, and they all praise their names.The name of the emperor is circulated between the Xinghe, which is the soul of the empire, and the immortal.

However, the dark current in the universe is surging, the enemy is around, and the heresy statement has emerged from time to time.With its supreme wisdom, the Emperor created many systems to expel the heresy and consolidate the foundation of the empire.The light of faith, Pu Zhaozhu, admires all peoples, and hide in heresy.Those who deviate will be condemned by the world and make people feel correct.

The prosperity of the empire depends on the leadership of the Emperor, and the loyalty of its ministers and the people.The ministers are loyal to the liver and be loyal, and they are exhausted to report to the country.On the side of the Emperor, there are many wise men who have contributed strategies, planned all the planning, and help them achieve their achievements.The power of the empire, shocked the Xinghe, the enemy heard the wind and was frightened, and dared to commit it lightly.

Therefore, the existence of the empire is the blessing of human beings, the virtue of the emperor, and the flow of all the world.With this ambition, the spirit of the Emperor Emperor and the Emperor of the Emperor God, for the sake of human beings, struggle.May the light of the empire, the forever in the universe, the name of the emperor, the eternal life.This is my wish, and it is also the wish of all humanity.

In 2024, among all releases, I was waiting for this particular game.The expectations were mundane at the level of ""post -shooter from 3 faces of the hour for 6.""On the one hand, it turned out, and on the other, the game gave a lot of impressions.

Visual component
She is amazing here.The graphics of the present look like a large project of 2024.Artists perfectly conveyed the most complicated architecture of the world Warhammer 40k, while not going to compromises.Yes, we are often locked in small in the same type of locations, but it is worth reaching the surface and you see the scale of the war: monumental buildings that combine medieval archival with retro futurism against which hundreds of people with thousands of creatures fight.This is impressive.

This is not a new genre, but it is unique.On the one hand, this is, on the other hand.However, despite a simple genre generalization.For example, from Doom that allow you to get armor and health and are necessary for survival.There is a simplified for close combat, which also provides survival in battle.Various variations from long -distance, to close combat and close combat combinations.This gameplay at first seems loaded, but after the hour of the game you understand how everything is simple in it and how everything is in its place without unnecessary mechanic.Animation of finishing achievements is juicy and more spectacular than in doom.A sea of ​​blood and a crunch of alien creatures.Sweet Baby Inc is smoked aside.


The musical component is made in the style of the game, but.When you go to crumble hundreds and thousands of opponents, I would like to do it under an expressive soundtrack so that the audio -component synchronize with what is happening on the screen.Unfortunately, this is not here.Even in subtitles they did not add any memorable music, this is sadness.

What .In this game, the final is made by the finale.With all the epic, the effects and scale among which the player who reached the final uses all his arsenal and skills to the maximum.It looks spectacular.

It is also worth briefly mentioning that here, but the abundance of modes more justifies the price tag spent on the game.I still run to the seemingly simple multiplayer.

For me, this is an example of those games that I dreamed of zero when the game industry only developed: spectacular juicy gameplay, epic from the number of opponents, a beautiful graphics and the ability to pass all this in a cooperative if desired.Earlier, I only imagined this, playing the classic strategies for Warhammer 40k, and today, Saber Interactive gave us the first expensive game for this huge and old franchise.Definitely, for me it is.",2024/9/23,ru

Satisfying gunplay, good melee combat, great graphics.
The campaign is average and short but still well worth playing.
Co-op operations are fun but we need lot more of them.
PVP I personally don't care and will never play it.



Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a good game but there's not enough content atm.
The gameplay is good but it's sadly a bit repetitive after a while.
The operations are highly replayable, thanks to the different classes which are all fun to play but there is sadly not enough maps right now. I'm max rank with best weapons on Vanguard, Assault, Tactical and Sniper so there's not much left to do in the game for me now.

As it currently stands I must say that games like Darktide, Exoprimal, Earth Defense Force or Warframe for examples are way better survival/horde co-op games simply because they provide lot more replay value.

Jokes aside, this game is everything the Warhammer 40k: Space Marine community has been hoping for. Not only does it serve as a solid sequel to the previous title, but it also sends a clear message to the gaming industry: players are craving shorter, simpler games that deliver high quality and polish. Here’s what it brings to the table:

Intense Combat: The seamless blend of gunplay and melee combat keeps the action dynamic and engaging throughout.

Visuals and Environment Design: The graphical upgrades and meticulous attention to detail provide an impressive visual experience.

Immersive Storyline: The game draws you into the dystopian Warhammer 40k universe with a mature narrative that revolves around epic battles.

Challenging Enemy Hordes: Facing off against the Tyranids adds an extra layer of difficulty, requiring constant movement and strategic thinking. And let's not forget the heretic traitors—on higher difficulty levels, they’re formidable opponents that force you to rethink your strategy.

Stunning Art Direction: It’s often overlooked, but the art direction in this game is phenomenal. From sprawling battlefield scenes to towering cathedrals, every building and wall feels like a piece of art. The combat may keep you too busy to notice, but when you get a moment to take it all in, it’s hard not to be impressed.

That said, there are a few caveats:

Potential Repetitiveness: Depending on your progression, the horde combat can start to feel repetitive.

Campaign Length: The campaign is fairly standard in length and varies with difficulty, but the narrative remains compelling throughout.

All in all, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 serves as a beacon for the industry, proving that you don’t need groundbreaking innovations to create a great game. Sometimes, a bit of refinement to an already solid formula is all it takes. That’s my take on the game—I hope this helps you decide whether it’s worth a playthrough! :)

Foreword:
After a lapse of 13 years, the generation of Star Warriors, formerly known as ""War Hammer: Killing Wushuang"", finally ushered in a sequel. The sequel not only changed the developer but also changed the publisher. It is produced by the team that has developed ""War World Z"", so there are many WWZ gameplay shadows, but the ""execution"" characteristics of the previous game have been retained; The problem of unstable instrument and repeated content of the existing game make some players feel that some players do not meet the pricing, but if you are the servant of the emperor's enthusiasm, now it is time to present loyalty!




The story of the game lasted for the first generation. Although the protagonist of the extreme warrior, although he tried to resist Okuk and chaos, he was still sent to the end of the trial court because he was accused of being stained with chaos. He was included in the ""Death Watching"" battle that specializes in the Termine Zerg. After a centennial battle of the Zerg, Titus was seriously injured in a mission. To live, the battle regiment transformed him into a more powerful ""Original Star Fighter"" and allowed him to return to the team as the deputy. Essence

The second -generation stories are developing compact, smooth narrative, and fully demonstrated the ""hard -core men's"" war hammer style. In the single -player battle, we played Titus to lead the new extreme soldiers to perform various tasks to prevent the Zerg and chaotic forces. In the PVE mission, the perspective of another team will help Titus complete the task and strengthen the plot not mentioned in the battle, but there is almost no element in the single -player battle, so that the sense of growth and change in the battle process will lack a sense of growth and change in the battle. Sex makes the battle a bit like a teaching for multiplayer models. The entire process is relatively short, about 7-8 hours of length. It is similar to a generation, which is a pity.






Whether it is the main line of battle or the PVE mode, players can enjoy the sense of refreshing combat strikes in this game. Use various weapons in the world of war hammers, such as ""power swords"" and ""hot melting guns"" to slaughter the Terlen Zerg However, strictly speaking, this game is not a unparalleled game. In the battle, under various Zerg enclosures, the armor and blood volume of the characters will be exhausted soon (not at all). The armor can be recovered with time. The blood volume is to kill the enemy to return the blood while turning the black background. We can only get an injection to make up for the black background. Therefore, we need to use the combat mechanism to make a certain ""right move"" with the enemy.

The Zerg soldiers rarely affect the players. You can concentrate on dealing with various elite heads on the battlefield. When the enemy attacks, the perfect grid and dodge can perform a ""gun attack"". Two enemies will show flaws. At this time, we can perform ""execution"" to restore armor immediately. This execution process is different from the generation. Invincible state can also be triggered at mid -range. Try to execute as much as possible!

It may not be refreshing enough to fight at first, but it is much simpler after mastering the way to interact with the enemy, but because of this, almost all battles will be carried out in the process of ""defense → gun attack → execution"". It will become a bit duplicate, no matter what the situation and occupation are inseparable from ""execution"".






In the PVE mode of the game, we can choose one of the six Star Warrior occupations to check the level. Each occupation has a fixed equipment that can be used, as well as unique skill trees. The weapon data collected in the level can make the guns skilled and get the number of gun skills. The current professional strength is a bit unbalanced. At the same time, the upgrade progress of each occupation is completely independent. If you practice heavy heads, the repetition will be relatively high.

The design purpose of the level used as PVE is to strengthen the main line of the main line, so there is a very fixed process in the level. Although the elite leader of the appearance is random, the overall change is not large. There will be a combination of map randomness+task randomness, so the repetition of the scrolling level will be faster and easier to get tired than other games under the comparison. Overall, the number of levels is not enough.

But like other war hammers IP games, this game has a very rich custom content. There can be various imprints, runes and badges on the armor, as well as 9 major legions, teams, and even Chaos Star Warrior factions. Various decorations and styles can be collected, but if you want to collect these decorations, there will be a long -length clearance process. It can be said to be created for fans. At present, one of the main incentives and pursuit of goals in multiplayer games.





现 The excellent picture performance, the battle scene of the spectacular epic battle
剧 Wonderful and compact plot, continuing the story of the generation
的 Fastened fighting, all kinds of execution of blood spraying slurry
装The handsome armor shape and appearance

The single -player battle process is short, and there are problems with optimization of specific scenes
关 Cooperative PVE mode level has fewer levels, fixed processes, and easy to get tired
The server is bad, and the ping will be traced back!
平 Insufficient balance between occupations and weapons





The game is currently optimized and the server connection is rotten, as well as a service -oriented game that is also a war hammer IP, such as the ""Plague"" series or a relatively new ""Black Tide"". After a month of upsurge, the number of players may drop sharply. This can only wait for the number of levels of the multi -person model after the official update. In terms of the current version, the situation of the war hammer powder can play very much. If you are satisfied, the non -fan is only a single CP value, and it is easy to enlarge the existing problems. Therefore, it is recommended that non -fan players can wait a little discount before starting.

For the first time, the game will be forced to install EPIC Online Serivers software. This is to allow users of different platforms to connect to the platform. The official seems to be written in the EULA protocol. If you really care, there are many ways to teach players on the Internet how to stop EOS. As long as there is no need for cross -platform connection, this is a software that can be completely installed. If you have any doubt ...",2024/9/15,ko

1. The characters are extremely fragile. The shield is the same as paper. After full level, go to the simplest difficulty to practice weapons. It is mixed with a group of mobs with a samurai.The remote monster was almost virtual, and then from time to time, I still brushed the monsters outside of my vision behind me, and came in directly outside the screen to surprise me.When you apply Captain Jia to say, ""I have been associated with these mobs at level 1, and level 25 is still abused by them. Isn't TM upgraded?""
2. The weapon is extremely unbalanced, and the difficult and difficult hot melt is almost a must -have. The result of the danger of melee weapons is not as good as the hot melting out of the risk of being beaten.Block, the problem is that it can be understood with the professional setting of Dunwei. What about the assault?I hope you can do a good job of balance between weapons, but be careful not to weaken hot -melt, but to strengthen other weapons.There must be a few weapons in the game that there must be a few without players, but when most weapon players do not want to touch, what does it mean to design these things?
3. The judgment of the gun attack is extremely weird. It is nearly far, and sometimes you can not put the face when you can shoot the face. Sometimes it is inexplicably given you one by one. There is no invincible judgment during the gun attack.The first attack was blocked in the tyrant's multiple attacks, but it was killed by the second attack in the gun attack.You must want to encourage players to use this system, but what does it mean to violent during use?
4. I used the handle. I accidentally pressed the ""New Game"" option by accidental picture, and then entered some pictures set by some games in the new game, but I wanted to go back to the title screen but could not find the option at all. ESC was useless.I do n’t know if there is any revision of this problem now. At that time, I was worried that I would cover the archive. I closed the game by alt+F4.Are you funny?
5. The weapon is extremely boring. The main reason is that the weapon design mentioned above is imbalanced, coupled with the combination of monster supermodels, and the rogue quality of highly difficult weapons to use low weapons to make the entire process extremely suffering.If you don't want to balance the weapon, add a groove that can store excess experience after adding a weapon, so that I can allocate the extra experience obtained after the full level to other weak chicken weapons.
6. I don’t know what kind of triggering mechanism is brushing. Sometimes, in the absence of monsters, there are many waves of monsters in the current area, and then there is almost no strange in the next battle area.Does it look at us and then improvise the monsters in the next area to generate it in advance?

This is a excellent addition to the Warhammer 40K Gaming Universe. The creative team did a great job at providing a fresh story experience while building on the narrative of the original. You really do learn to appreciate and fight with your squad by the end. I could go on at length, but the Emperors work is best experienced rather than described.

+ Combat is fluid and dynamic.
+ Excellent variety of weapons
+ Action and design of gameplay, characters an d plot feel true to the setting.
+ Truly breathtaking environment design ... This wholly immerses you in the monumental scale of
the 41st Millenium.
- I preferred the shield and health system from the first game, but this is fine once you adapt to it.
- They removed dodge rolling, now dodge is more of a standard scoot to the side :( (But effective)

Wooohooo,1,11,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Woooohoooo/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

Despite the fact that the review is positive, for me it's more of a ""yellow"" type of review (which I hope they will eventually add to Steam, though I’m starting to doubt it). The game looks expensive and polished, it's a good, not overly long action game set in the Warhammer universe, with excellent cutscene direction and beautiful visuals. The combat looks epic, and the gameplay on a gamepad is really well done. The joystick vibrates and even reacts to walking, giving the character in the Space Marine suit a sense of ""weight.""

However, that's where the positives end for me. Here's what really bothered me. First, the combat feels quite repetitive. While smashing enemies is fun in the first few hours, it quickly gets stale and stops being enjoyable. Moreover, I noticed that the difficulty seems a bit broken because on higher difficulty levels, combat turns into an unpleasant mess. You have to constantly spam parries, and even then, enemies will still flank you and ""make your life miserable."" But if you lower the difficulty just one notch, the game becomes too easy and uninteresting.

The variety of enemies is small, and they're pretty dull, requiring no special tactics to defeat. The multiplayer PvP mode, by the way, is terrible - I didn't like it at all, and I don't recommend it. It feels like it's just there for the sake of it.
The special operations that run parallel to the story can be considered a positive aspect, as they let you try out different Space Marine classes and include some progression. However, they don't add much depth to the game, though they do make it a bit better.

For fans of the Warhammer universe or those who just want to switch off their brain and enjoy some action and shooting for a couple of evenings, I would recommend it. But it's best not to have high expectations, as they got in the way for me.",2024/9/18,en

Combat is fluent and clean, feels like a mix of gears of war and a bit of soulslike with the parrying and dodging. It's not clunky at all like some people say it is.

Most weapons feels good to use and combat finishers is a dopamine rush when they occur especially on bosses.

I had not enjoyed a campaign of such a well -achieved game, the story is exciting, the gameplay is addictive, intense fighting, the blocking system with auctions flies with pleasure, graphics and impressive sounds, they go to the compass of the Warhammer universe.

The campaign is 6 missions, but I want to highlight that the missions are long, read people complaining that it is very short and wrong!

Operations (PVE), is the most popular way of the game, here we have to select 6 types of classes, the characters can be progressed in skill, armaments, cosmetics, paintings etc;The challenges and playability are guaranteed, there are 6 different missions and last approximately 30min to more if they extend due to difficulties, there are also 4 modes of difficulties (the challenge would be to win in the last “ruthless”, an abuse of blows imagine)
If they will realize, this game has a similarity in terms of the selection of modes, progress, the basis for the “Aliens Firelam Elite” and if they are the same editors.

Eternal War Mode (PVP), there are 3, conquest, captures and annihilation of the moment;It is not bad but this is not a game for competitive, this to have a good time with team of friends and no more;It allows equipment of up to 6 x sides, I tried the ways and do not generate that adrenaline as in other shooters in 3rd, ""it is obvious here you moves like turtle Ja""

I will put it in capital letters: ""It is excellently optimized""!It gives pleasure that such a game comes out today.
Another success is the multiplatform crossed, that allows you to always find people in the different CO op modes and lengthen the life of a game.

Khornebrzrkr,1,86,https://steamcommunity.com/id/khornebrzrkr/,"Much like with Star Wars, when a good Warhammer game comes along, you have to hold onto it with both hands.

Space Marine 2 is not an Oscar-winning performance. The dialog in the campaign mode won't have you pondering the (super)human condition and the plot contrivances aren't all that original. The premise of the campaign is even a mirror to the original game's hook, which you could see as good or bad.

But the thing about Titus' story is that you can see the struggle he's dealing with if you know where to look. Sadly that probably won't happen if this is your first 40k game, but it IS a sequel, after all. A player with background knowledge of who Titus is as a man, and who he has to be as a space marine, can see the deep emotional turmoil he finds himself in, a man out of place after the events of the first SM game. The engaging and visceral combat, which is not keeping any secrets about itself, will have you fully believing that every big fight is for all the marbles. I particularly found myself trying as hard as I could to protect NPC imperial guardsmen wherever I found them from the hordes of Tyranids trying to reduce them to biofuel.

They also let you Paint Your Dudes. This is vitally important.

Space Marine 2 is probably the single greatest realization of what the world of Warhammer 40,000 would not only look, but move and sound like. It's had some great competition in recent years like Darktide and Boltgun, but I think this is the new pinnacle.",2024/9/15,en

applekwisp,0,16.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/applekwisp/,"Solid game, but in my opinion it has a lot of problems that make it hard to recommend in its current state. I completed the game on Angel of Death (AOD) solo for reference. I played all the operations coop at least once. I played a few rounds of PVP, I won't comment on that since I didn't really enjoy it.

The good is that it's a direct continuation of the first. I was happy to see show up in the game in a role that made sense. Overall the lore, environments, and audio were fantastic. The hordes of enemies were impressive and some of the set pieces were neat. Just like the first I loved using the jump jets and thunder hammer to crash down on enemies.

There were so many things that combined made this game just not that enjoyable compared to the first for me:
The game feels like it was designed for coop first and everything suffers for it. The campaign is filled with generic objectives like hold the location, press these buttons, etc. They don't feel tailor made for campaign experience but a cooperative one. Everything is forced to load to the useless battle barge before you load into an actual mission. This could easily have just been a UI menu.









I assume most of these issues could be patched for sure and some of them may actually be realistically improved. As it stands though at full price, it's a steep ask for what you get in the package. There is most certainly no longevity to the operations, they are largely static with no variation aside from where/when enemies spawn. PVP is PVP, nothing special. This is a sale game for sure.

I am glad that Russian developers have not forgotten how to make games: the St. Petersburg department Saber gave us a chic action.

The atmosphere of Vorhammer is recreated successfully - there is a dreadnought, instantly crumbling hordes of enemy, and the executions of deserters, and obsessed psikers, and the universal paranoia, which is not alien to space marines.Excellent location design: Gothic is enough, there are also mysterious tombs and a wasteland distorted by chaos.

A pleasant combat system is to crush the hordes of tyranids quite fun, and you will see a lot of epic scenes where the enemies of the rod is almost thousands.With the Chaosites that appear later, not so fun, let's hope that new races of opponents such as orcs or necrons will add from the DLS.However, there are good bosses among the Tinchites.

The plot is good for an action movie: there is both intrigue and epic, final scenes with the participation of a crowd of ultramarins are worthy of separate praise.

In general, a peppy action movie who, under ordinary conditions, would receive an assessment of ""above average.""But against the background of numerous failures like Starvors, it looks almost a game of the year.Well, 40K games are stably released, here Spacmarin sets a new bar.

JKSR,0,207.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jk30422/,"Update: Monk friendship, excellent!Congratulations to the hammer.The update has not been comfortable to return to the distinguished single in a few days, it's great!

The assault and sniper must be forced to fight, and it is exciting to think about it.
N5 is more outrageous remote damage than previous N4.
And the more outrageous special refresh (two Licat+two brain insects in a small space), and you also forced you to hold a group sticker.
The current N5 three people are basically dissatisfied with the editor.
Your teammates are kneeling, and you don't have to wait for your teammates to directly push the map to directly kneel.
You are waiting for your teammates for more than 200 seconds, and the probability of brushing more brain insects and Licat is high.You are afraid of three Licat.
Bullets are often empty, and the two spiritual encephaloses cooperate with Licat to attack and brush the BOSS.
Not only that, under the difficulty of N4, the probability of multiple spiritual encephaloshims at the same time has greatly increased, which is more fleshy than before.

Give you the handle, you come.

A PVE game is actually so cool that the player brushes, a powerful NERF player.

Generally, such difficulties will not be designed.
The general shake pen does not have such a red stone.

---

At present, the game content is scarce and lacking.

As a game that focuses on PVE, the reward mechanism of the game is a bit outrageous.You can only obtain experience through chapter nodes and complete task goals.
However, the monster refresh during the task is random, so it will appear. Maybe you can go to the final node in a certain game; three brain insects appear in a certain game (of course, the refresh of the brain insect is not ending, it is impossible to end.Where it cannot be killed).
Taking the 1st Purgatory as an example, you may only defend the generator once in the 钷 refinery area to enter the next area. It may also be a four -generator in the next four guards to repair the crane machine, and finally brush a special enemy, such as a knife, such as a knife, such as a knifeAx.Remember that the experience mentioned earlier is only through the chapter nodes and the complete chapter task goals.Then in the first case, you have no additional rewards at all in the first case through the purgatory refining plant, and in the second case.

Secondly, the current game balance is very bad, a large number of hot -melt people.In addition to the combat style, the melee can play a little bit, and the other two styles are very eaten.Don't get close to the extremely low kill efficiency.

When single players are playing, the backplane of your map is almost the same. It is also stupid to wait for the AI ​​transmission in front of the control panel. Can't you consider doing it? Do you directly unlock the control panel without one player?
The same constipation experience is that I have to wait for the end of the conversation to interact with the task element.As for the current content, you need to hit it a few times. Where is the task interaction point? The monsters are refreshed there.

It is also necessary to specifically criticize the current online connection matching mechanism. The progress of offline play is not preserved. I can understand it to prevent cheating.However, it seems that the effect is very effective at present.
At present, I have a very unfriendly experience of the unique wolf player. I have encountered more than one time to match the task matching for 5 minutes and did not match.Single people open the task, hit the final task node, stuck, and then the task has 80%-90%. In this case, you should not use me as a host to give meDo you come to match me? Do you develop the game you do n’t play?

I have to mention some other places with poor experiences, such as currently existing and high -frequency -ended animation lenses with messy bugs.There are also Pioneer Claws inconsistent with the PVE and PVP experience.It is difficult to not doubt whether it is because of the judgment of the unable to deal with the unable to handle hook claws in the complex environment of the PVE, so simply prevent you from using hook claws in PVE to interact with the environment?

Finally, in 2024, this game is also a loading simulator.Combined with the high blood pressure transfer host mentioned above, the host leaves, unlimited loading, very good.

Arcvox,1,24.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/arcvox/,"Space Marine 2 is an excellent sequel to the original, improving on the original game in almost every aspect. As it currently stands, I think it's a great game and represents the 40K universe very well, capturing grand scale combat zones on gorgeous alien planets. That said, it can certainly do with some quality of life improvements, which is to be expected of most new games out the gate. Hopefully they will address certain issues quite quickly, though most of these didn't affect the game in a negative way. More details on that below.

The game itself follows the story from the first game, which was a fairly basic story about the discovery of a relic which brings about nothing but trouble for the protagonist, Titus. Essentially, he is paying penance for his ""crime"" in the last game, which consists of him not dying. As a result of this, he has grown distrustful of his fellow brothers, which in turn makes his brothers not trust him - along with the obvious fact that he mysteriously vanished for the last couple of centuries. The campaign takes place over 3 planets, while certain storyline events take place concurrently with the Operations game mode, which is essentially another 6 missions in co-op mode, where you can play as a custom Space Marine.

The gameplay is pretty basic. It's very similar to Gears of War without the cover system, instead relying on stunning and executing enemies to restore your overshields. You'll be mixing up melee and gun play mopping up large numbers of basic enemies while eliminating the larger threats, which mostly consist of two large factions each with around 6-7 enemy types each, and some boss type enemies too.

Overall, I do recommend this game, however I do feel that the amount of content itself is a little bit lacking. Saber have made a very good game platform for more content to be added, and I can imagine different scenarios and missions could easily be added to objective mode. Having completed the campaign, it definitely feels as though it's meant to be played co-op too, especially with all the cool cosmetics you can unlock in the multiplayer modes. These additions I feel like would be low effort for the developer, so maybe they will consider it in the future.

Other than the small quality of life improvements and a bit of tweaking on some of the multiplayer classes, I think Saber did an excellent job, and I look forward to more content. The storyline is gripping, the visuals are amazing, and it's the sort of fun gory gameplay that we used to get a lot of in gaming, so it's nice to have a callback to that.


- Excellent visuals that brings the 40K universe to life in an authentic way.
- Captures the essence of the Space Marines in all their glory (though on harder difficulties you won't feel very powerful at all)
- Impressive horde mechanics, particularly in their movement. Climbing up walls and scrambling over each other suits the tyranids amazingly.
- Combat is fairly basic but fun, and glory killing enemies never seems to get old.


- Gaining multiplayer XP is incredibly slow, given that you'll be repeating online content a fair bit. This is exacerbated by the fact that cosmetics use the same currency as productive upgrades such as perk points. I feel like the two should have been separated so you can work towards your favorite chapter AND progress in abilities so you can pull your weight better in teams.
- Melee in particular needs some buffs, as it tends to do little damage compared to firearms.
- Harder difficulties are quite overtuned at the moment. This is especially apparent against ranged enemies, who always seem to have a clear line of sight to your team and make extremely quick work of you while in combat.
- Missing some obvious and easy to implement quality of life improvements, such as a co-op campaign mode, customisable campaign armor sets using cosmetics from the multiplayer, and weapons carrying over from certain chapters. I noticed in the campaign, Titus regularly has his default armor and weapons, which is understandable in CGI cutscenes, but not in the in-game ones. Also, I would have preferred to have the helmets on the team for the custscenes too. There is an option for this, but it only affects gameplay moments.",2024/9/17,en
Chaplain Hearth,1,86,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hearthwarning/,"Introduction

I always wanted to make my own space marine, color it, choose the chapter i want, play with but getting into the 40k Mini's is hard and expensive. But with this game you can immerse yourself in the world of 40k and be a Space Marine for US$60.

Regardless whether you're into 40K or not, if you like 3rd person shooter, fighting xenos (aliens) with 2 other people, that has a good Story Campaign, 6 different classes in Pve Operations mode, and a PVP, then this game is for you

Pros and Cons
(Pros) Immersive and great campaign mode that delves into the 40K universe (especially Ultramarines Chapter which is 40k Warhammer golden boy). (Cons) The campaign is quite short, which is less then 15 hours





So in conclusion, think it's a great game and a lot of fun to play with friends or random. This game had been a blast compared to some of the 40K games released before this, and it lives up to the first Space Marine.

And when attached to one point near the end of BuckThe mission is not processed.Even if the game has been repaired
Still have the opportunity to meet BuckCausing him to die allAnd can start playing again for about 30 minutes per checkpoint
The more difficult to playThe more tired and have to hit the enemy for many times longer than before.

Including the AI ​​system. If you are a very bad Single player, you will be lonely and lonely.
At the moment, the AI ​​system has not been fixed. It's very difficult. I said more than Souls like sekiro Elden Rings Dark Souls.
Before going through each checkpoint with the most difficult level, torture, because the game is like playing many people
And AI acts as worst as they encountered. Darktide that AI seems like no brain.This game is like AI jellyfish.

Therefore, overall, give 7/10 for the future.
Because it is expensive and considered to pass because of the fun fighting system
And thought that his future would solve

Because if not fixed, it will only give 5-6 points. Enough to pass the game of the game with challenges and various levels that players can choose themselves.
And also watch in terms of decorating the character's armorIt's quite interesting that we can adjust to almost all parts.
But couldn't create the characterSo do it for people who want to have a handsome armor.
The same, all armor, of course, of course, just the color and symbolic pattern at this time.

So who doesn't have friends?Add to play togetherNia speak the truth without blessing.
Both the advantages and disadvantages, waiting to believe us for a long time, there will be games that we play and feel thatNot worth the price
Because we enjoy with every game, almost all. Just fun. If not fun, we will always regenerate.

... what I liked

✅ Spectacular combat system, where it is corny nice to kick beetles in the face with an iron boot.

✅ Cool sound design, thanks to which you feel the power of each shot and by ear understand the actions of enemies in battle.

✅ Visually - one of the most beautiful modern games, there is nothing to add.

✅ Surprisingly decent plot and excellent work with a story through the environment, which allows you to realize the entire hton setting.

✅ One of the best Russian game dubbing over the years.

✅ Good performance, which brought only murderous moments for CPU (I have a bunch of Ryzen 5600 and RTX 4070).


❌ The combat system is mechanically exhausted very quickly, leaving the player with a series of identical arenas with enemies.

❌ Only two fractions of opponents limited in unique units.

❌ There are too many visually monotonous types of weapons in which you get confused until the end of the game.

❌ terribly uncomfortable control from the keyboard in battle with unpleasant orientation in the menu from the gamepad.

❌ Nethodom leaves much to be desired and loves to throw a player at a server with a high ping or always reconquit the connection through the black screen.

❌ Long downloads even with NVM SSD.

❌ The game was balanced under the cooperative, so there are peaks of difficulties when playing alone, because the partners are simply not trained in anything but the player’s shooting and resuscitation.

❌ PVE-mode of operations is exhausted as quickly as the combat system, without offering something more interesting than a half-hour run on arenas with enemies.

❌ PVP mode as if made for Rofle and did not even test.

❌ Excessively long pumping of classes in a multiplayer.


Space Marine 2 is an incredibly beautiful and tactfully pleasant game that it becomes uninteresting to play at the fifth hour of gameplay due to lack of depth in the combat system and the monotony of game situations.Multiplayer modes, in turn, are no good as endheim content.It is extremely difficult for me to recommend the game for a full price tag, but be sure to return to sales, because this is still the most delicious militant in the setting of 40k and a good cooperative entertainment.",2024/9/15,ru

Playing on veteran (intended difficulty) fails as delivering the power fantasy of mowing down hordes of foes and brutally destroying worthy foes with consummate skill. The armour generating mechanic works but even horde enemies do so much damage it is often depleted immediately. The health regen mechanic just doesn't work - constantly getting downed, scrounging for medicae packs and spamming ultimate ability as much as possible just get some health back the core game play loop. Titus feel sluggish and the enemies are too bullet spongy. The combat just feels 'off'.

A review from a person that he was very far from 40K and knows that Magnus did not betray and the emperor is God, but the game interested the universe and I began to watch a little more video about Laura 40k.

Incredibly delaying gameplay, the speed of pumping is acceptable, you want faster - go to the operations above the first level.I recommend playing on the most released complexity to obtain the very spirit of the eternal war when, leaving the great wave of opponents, you exhale deeply what you could, overcame, literally crumbling from enemies.These feelings can be compared with the well -worked out boss from the Souls of Games.
Permanent checks of your reaction will be.

If you want a close battle - there are 3 variations of the classes that are focused in close combat, but nothing will stop you if you want to make a close battle from the sniper, it will work.The fighting from blocks, dumps, parries with extremely beautiful finishing, especially xenos (local beetles), will not leave the lover of the Souls of Games.

If you want a distant battle - to choose from the 3rd class that they can play through shooting and grade 1 hybrid.Impact from weapons - return and entering enemies, it is felt, although not the entire firearm is really good.Hadhot heads scatter into minced meat with an echo for each such murder.

At the moment, the campaign is available for 6-10 hours (depending on the complexity), 6 PVE operations and PVP with three types of tasks.
Operations will be the main layer of gameplay.Each task is a direct corridor with arenas from start to finish, but this is even a plus for those who were sophisticated by empty open worlds.Here is one goal - go further and tear and shred everything that will stand on your way.
The location and number of opponents in the same operation will be random, a random boss with a chance will appear on the difficulties above the 1st (at the moment the beetles have 2 boss, the second faction 1).
Consumables in the form of grenades, cartridges, first -aid kits, relics (self -Revayv) will also be added by accident and the amount decreases the higher the level of complexity.
Geno -sore - the subject that you need to convey to the end of the mission by never falling to the knee to the carrier can appear on the mission with a chance and if you convey +40% of the experience.
A skull with a resource for pumping weapons on the following rarity appears 1 time per mission with a random location at fixed spavna points.
The difficulty 4 passes only either a well -played group of not very strong players or very strong ray players (why not solo will be slightly lower, although real).
PVP is felt quite balanced, but I played only 5 matches, so that my opinion can be false.

Very well -polished game, from the bugs that I met in 130 hours of game:
1) the inability to shoot/interact with anything until you press the change of weapons-it occurs once every 6-10 hours of gameplay and arises either independently during resurrection, or when joining someone in the game
2) Overchil of the restored HP that you can abuse curing the foul if there is enough damage
3) reset cd weapons if you change to primary/secondary
4) for 130 hours of game 1 time met the impossibility of resa because of death in the texture
5) a leviting player can be very rare

The main disadvantages of the game:
1) It is very undesirable to play alone, play at least with randomes, in the worst case they will do as much as the bot.The bots are extremely stupid and the maximum at that they are suitable to throw a grenade every 5 minutes and not die so as to rescue the players and it happens that they stand up and freeze.The complexity of 3-4 solo, without completely bitten weapons and class, without choosing equipment and perks for the mission, is extremely difficult to go through.
2) Optimization in the game is lame, 3080 on ultras gives out 40-60 FPS, only DLSS on the balance sheet or below saves the situation.At the very beginning, even the game could not be launched further than the first cut-scene due to the fact that the game was on HDD, not SSD.
3) there is no support of the ultra of high resolutions, but will be brought in the coming days.
4) there are few content in operations, there are only 6 of them, the gameplay delays when you stop paying attention to the same tasks of the missions.
5) a strange solution with impenetrable textures.On the first mission, if you meet a flying enemy, you will notice how shooting at the leaves, the bolts will not pass through and you will spend the cartridges in vain.Sometimes there will be situations with opponents that they cause reinforcements standing behind the textures of the railing and you will not be able to shoot them and knock down the call.
6) constant loads, to the game, from the game.You will often press Alt F4 after waiting for 4+ minutes of loading to someone in the lobby.",2024/9/17,ru

From the moment I stepped into the boots of Captain Titus once again, I was hooked. The combat is absolutely brutal in all the best ways. Whether you're smashing through hordes of Tyranids with a chainsword or mowing them down with bolter fire, the action is fast, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. The melee and ranged combat balance feels perfect, and pulling off those savage executions never gets old.

The visuals are a massive leap forward compared to the first game. The environments are gritty and detailed, really capturing the grimdark essence of the 40K universe. Whether you’re fighting in ruined cityscapes or alien-infested hives, it all looks stunning and immersive.

One of the biggest highlights for me is the coop multiplayer. Playing with friends and unleashing the wrath of the Emperor as a team is an absolute blast. The teamwork and coordination required to survive against the swarms of enemies really elevates the experience, making it feel like you’re part of a true Space Marine squad.

Frantik,1,12.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkFrantik/,"A pleasant, even sentimental journey to the PS360 era, when most of the action games focused on a single player was free of unnecessary quirks and tons of distractions.In such a spirit, in combination with a modern setting, a Space Marine 2 was created.

From the first moments in the campaign you can feel that the game knows what he wants to be and offers it exactly.The fight is fleshy and honey, and at the same time simple but not coarse and is satisfactory.Even the development of the character does not distract our attention, and the finders are residual (audiologies, which, moreover, are easy to overlook).

Positive impressions are complemented by a well -dedicated, heavy atmosphere of Warhammer 40K and sometimes a noticeably monumental scale of events, whose feeling is also significantly helped by clouds of opponents, sometimes consisting of hundreds of individuals who can create ""live towers"" in the image of those from World War Z.

Gameplay, Gears fans will feel here at home, because with the exception of hiding behind the shields, they will get everything they liked the series from Microsoft.The protagonist and other space marines are the right gigachades, although they can feel their fanaticism here more than testosterone.
On the minus SM2, in turn, there is a smaller variety of gameplay.We run, shoot, chop or break or dodge - only so much, not counting two quite short moments when we get a jetpack that allows temporary rising into the air.It is a pity that you would even ask for some sights on the board of combat machines, which we see the whole fan during the story.

When shooting and chopping to the glory of the Emperor, you immediately feel that we are powerful.Smaller enemies explode like sacks with a wound, those slightly bigger quickly recognize our superiority, letting themselves be cut into pieces - we have a system of executions similar to that of modern dooms - a properly softened adversary catches Stuna and for a while is susceptible to an effective finisher that renews usSomething like armor or maybe more strength field.Interestingly, the same does not apply to the health belt - here we are addicted to finding first aid kits, which are quite few.
8-10h, which should be devoted to completing the single, can be extended with co-optic missions for about 30-45 minutes each.They are strongly related to feature events and, although various Unlocks are present there, they do not give the impression of a gaas shell.There is also a PvP mode, but I don't have much to say about it.It is a pity that the premiere lacked Horda mode.It is to be added there

Solid 8/10 and recommended from me, for everyone who longed for spectacular action and fleshy shooting.Even without knowing the WH 40K universe, you can play here without a problem (I only know so much that there are space marines who have God-Iperator and fight heresy and probably all other breeds of the universe, orcs or tyrandas).But it should be noted that Space Marine 2, just like the first part, does not explain anything from the world presented to us, leaving everything in our curiosity and ...

Non -war hammer 40K fans are cautious, fighting is actually average, ordinary standards.It is not a brainless and refreshing shooting game, you need to understand and operate.The balance between weapons and careers is not good, and some weapons and occupations are too weak.

Cons
-Comes out with DLC already being advertised
-Poor servers that lag (even during single player)
-Single player story is around 8h on hardest difficulty
-PvP mode is bare bones with painfully slow progression that locks any real customisation with high levels (not to mention you can only customise your look half the time as you're forced to wear heretic armour during half the matches which you can't customise)
-Loading screens on loading screens on loading screens (You might think I'm exaggerating to emphasise but you will have to do a loading screen to go into another loading screen for all multiplayer modes)

Pros
-Looks cool, visuals are really nice
-Its warhammer 40k

It's cool, it's not completely cool.

The refreshing part is the picture, which is enough for the 40K world to feed IP fans.

There is no completely cool part is the kernel of the gameplay. I strongly doubt whether the developer has some special XP, which causes them to make the following game characteristics:

1. I like to watch others fight and fight pistols myself.Well, everyone sees that I have made the main battle tank and fearless model, but sorry, players can only watch them firing and watch the large troops fight.When you turn your turn, I will give you a dozen bugs to practice the marksmanship for you. As for the tide and tank cannons in the distance, it is just a background board.

2. Is it orgasm?Give me back!Although there were only a dozen bugs who practiced my hands at a time, one said that the execution mechanism was still very cool, especially when I operated in the first level of the people in the chaos.At this time, my adrenaline broke out, and the human nore was combined.

Step 3

Step 4
While preparing the pan, the dish and the butter.
Step 5

Takioto,1,29.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/takioto/,"This game gave me one of the best experiences with games in 2024!

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 gives us something that is scarce today: fun and moments of admiration.It is those games that make you goose bumps with their rich scenarios full of history.And let's start there: the setting of this game is amazing!I sometimes recommend stopping during the phases and watching everything around you.It seems that every little piece before you has a story.Each stone, wall, and tree.Look at the sky, see these buildings ... It seems that they want to tell you something they have witnessed for years.This type of detail is rare in today's games.I recently read a story about the people involved in Warhammer, and they really show enthusiasm for projects and creations.They are happy doing this.And if you don't know, Warhammer is giant, especially there in gringa.

Now, let's talk about the franchise, which is dense, full of history, characters and scenarios with a gigantic weight, which makes the work even more complete.But if you are not familiar with the universe or heard of it little, don't worry.I didn't have it either, I started to be interested recently, because the game gave me this curiosity.There are already excellent Brazilian content creators addressing the theme.Space Marine 2 is a direct continuation of the first game, where we control the protagonist Titus.But don't worry, you don't have to play the first game.If you want to play, beauty, but in my opinion, the second game is an excellent gateway to this gigantic universe.

About gameplay: At first, the controls seem confused, but over time you get used to it, and everything falls like a glove.The combat is frantic and wakes up a lot of adrenaline when you face hordes of enemies.All of this while big explosions happen, the sky is filled with enemies and aircraft in constant combat, and the scenario is crumbling.It is a true war.

The campaign is ""short"", but it has the ideal size to make that taste of ""I want more"".Better this way than being dragged, full of winding like many games out there that try to sell the idea of ​​a giant campaign.In my opinion, she is at the right point.

Regarding performance, I played on the PC with a median configuration.I have an RTX 2060 and I can say that I was always above 70 FPS, using DLSS in quality mode.I did some research before purchasing the game and only saw praise for optimization.Yes, the game is well optimized and have already promised improvements in future updates.I don't have much information about consoles performance, so I owe it.

Speaking of updates, the game already has a roadmap showing a preview of what is coming.New operations, new enemies, armor, classes, weapons, and more.

The campaign can be played in Coop with two more friends.But the most fun to play in groups are operations.The game also has a PVP mode, although I haven't played much yet.I will explore more later.

Overall, Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 is being an excellent experience, and I recommend it too much!It's great to see that there are still games like that.If you have some money left, buy and have fun!

For the emperor!

mhenryblack,1,35.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mhenryblack/,"For almost a decade, I wished for a sequel to Space Marine.

I was afraid it would never happen. THQ crashing and burning had left the possibility of a true sequel in limbo. In spite of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, and a fairly large cult following, I had doubt that anyone would pick up the ball, and finish what Relic started.

Then, to my shock, a couple years ago, a trailer drops.

I wanted to shout for joy, but almost instantly, I became skeptical.

Worried that my beloved game could never have the sequel it deserved in our current development culture. The new studio would gut it of what made it's soul, insert contrived modern tropes and disrespect the source and setting.

I have NEVER been so happy to be wrong.

Space Marine 2 is Marvelous. Jaw-Dropping.

Saber has taken Relics Masterpiece to new heights, added new mechanics that enhance the experience and expanded the multiplayer, seamlessly weaving it into the campaign, making it far more interesting and addictive that it's predecessor.

It's BIGGER, BLOODIER and even more BAD*SS.

Titus' story continues, wonderfully connected to the previous installment, ending it's chapter with a promise of more, and leaving me READY for the next sequel. SM2 NAILS the vibe of Warhammer 40k, outright stunning at few moments. The setting and the previous game are treated with reverence and attention to detail.

For hours, I lost myself, engaged, immersed and awestruck at the spectacle, even more so because I had come to believe it would never happen.

I pre-order the Gold version games on PC, RTX2070, I7-10 etc ...
I now have 40 hours of games.

Spoil: I don't recommend it ...

Okay!The game is good.The universe is well rendered.We take part in beautiful battles.The fights are dynamic, it's gore, there is lore, personalization etc ...

But ... far too many negative points.

Already solo the campaign is too short.Cold shower at the last mission.A few more hours would have been welcome for a project for this extremely expected scale.The scriptwriters did a clean job, resembling the books but that's it.
The gameplay on the other hand was really badly fucked up and completely breaks the immersion.
Invisible walls on our way.Pressed a touch for more than a second to collect an object or activate a button.Be forced to hit two dialogue lines before opening a door ...
Level combat is arena.We put ourselves in the middle and we collect.No strategy, no cover.An extremely wobbly shield system, regeneration, execution, parade that has no synergy.No upgrade system of our hero.Some enemies become a real purge and the mass is not used for much if not put the brothel on the screen.

Coop ... Good!It's super cool to be able to play the parallel missions of the main adventure.On the other hand, where are the other missions?6 That's all ??An upgrade system that filled my eyes with tears to me after realizing that you would have to make scripted missions that I really don't want to start again.Especially since there is no link between the PVE and PVP ...

The PVP ... I expected a lot.I even thought he would give the countryside to focus on it ... Ba no.The progression system is really badly thought out.The class seem unbalanced to me.3 maps ... seriously ??Very few weapons and armor to unlock and which have little connection with the fact of setting up a particular class.No skins for chaos?!

Frankly there is a very good base for a good game but they only produced half of what should have been expected.The graphics are ok tier, the atmosphere catches up with the blow but not optimization ... The PC PC in average graphics.
There are only promises for the rest (Darktide syndrome?) And I have a lot of trouble believing it.

- Already, it's a corridor game and not necessarily most interesting, it's nice but it becomes very quickly repetitive.
- The game will not revolutionize anything, must be understood, it is a classic hack and slash.
- Currently, I do not know if it is only my case but still, optimization outside the game, that is to say the loads, the connection attempts, Toussa, are completely messy.
- The personalization of the characters, originally over-sale, is really not so advanced as that, there are quite a few elements of customization to unlock (and they are long enough to unlock the story to make it last).
- The bestiary is not very provided and, not to mention the rare bosses, we end up with no more than 5 different types of enemies for the two antagonistic factions.

FirePenguin,0,23.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fpenguin5349/,"At the moment the gameplay loop is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥
For melee:
- Chip damage is way to high with no tools of either preventing it, or replenishing health. (EDIT: A melee with ""fencing"" defence type has significantly reduced this problem)
- The idea of trying to keep getting armour as if it was replenishing health just isn't a sound one. The chances to replenish it are rare, but on top of that armour has such little HP and therefore what you regain is insignificant and often immediately lost.
- Parry is so odd. Not only have I found that holding the parry button delivers better results, but also a successful parry timing is done BEFORE the hit would land, unlike all other famous parry systems.
This is not an inherently bad idea, I think it's quite novel and interesting. Especially with the imagery of a parry that is prepared for being better than a parry that is ""just in time"". However this utterly ♥♥♥♥♥ the bed against small enemies in hordes. There is no predicting in a horde, there are attacks all the time and when you see an enemy wind up and you prepare to parry, that parry is highjacked by a random enemy that you weren't prepared for, turning your Perfect Parry into the ♥♥♥♥ parry. This leads to you getting STUNLOCKED which is a cardinal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sin in games like these. Absolute wank. (EDIT: This is completely removed by using a ""Fencing"" defence type weapon. Using one removes the ""just in time"" parry and makes all successful parries the same *actual* parry. Although this makes the game much much more playable and fun and removes the stunlocking, I kinda liked the preparing idea and would like to see it delegated to rare and boss heavy attacks).

Ranged:
- Guns feel like ♥♥♥♥♥ in terms of damage. A Rubric Marine cannot tank 20 Bolt rounds to the face unless the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is named.
- Ammo is rare as ♥♥♥♥ and because of the mentioned above, is absolutely useless as you burn right through it. I only don't feel this rarity when maining a melee class for obvious reasons.

Misc:
- What the everliving ♥♥♥♥ did they do to the Jump Pack in Operations? I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if I could fall out the map, just spawn me on top of a Player or NPC if that happens. There is no good reason to have neutered it so massively.
- also why is customisation just kind of poor? I guess more will come later but just in what I'm able to change, SM1 was superior. Why can't I change lens colour or thigh armour colour? And the fact there is only Mark X ♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Give me my gorgeous Mk 7 helmet and please don't make me pay £10 for it.
- The loading screens are abysmal and absurd. Sometimes it is faster to task manager the game out of existence than to sit through loading screens
- EDIT: the new fencing weapons feel kind of OP? I know it sounds like I'm complaining that one of my problems mentioned above is now fixed, but I can now just spam-parry my way out of minor-hordes. Not very engaging, stimulating or cognitive.

Fixes:
- Either reduce the damage Minor enemies deal in melee (one Tzeench minion should not take a whole bar off my shield), OR increase shield HP (shield HP is decent in Mini-boss events like Helbrutes so if HP is raised, so should Helbrute's damage by slightly), OR increase shield regen from specific enemy executions. Rubric marines should not give 1 shield with how much damage they deal, OR increase the health recovery after taking damage lifespan. It goes away far to fast to actually act upon.
- Have an more purposeful way to regain shield. I get nearly all of my Gun Strikes just unexpectedly, even though I'm always attempting to bash and stun enemies. Make bashing leading to a Gun Strike more consistent for minor enemies.
- You should not have to use the Prepare Parry mechanic for minor enemies. Not only does it play like ♥♥♥♥, they just aren't strong strong enough to put a Space Marine on the back foot.
- Buff the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Jump pack in Operations. It should go as far and be active as much as the campaign or PVP. ""Oh the slam, it would be too OP"" then nerf the slam damage dibshit.

I'm going to keep playing this game every now and then in hopes that the higher class level experience is better, but it can't be a good game if I have to slog through ♥♥♥♥ for 25 hours just to get it to play nice. Also I haven't tried PVP yet but I didn't come here to do that, I came to slaughter xenos and traitors and indulge in a rare substance called fun.",2024/9/14,en

Even 10 years ago, even the game was still like a stone, such a masterpiece came.

The story is striking, I didn't have graphic shortage and the graphics are really satisfactory.Most importantly, it is very nice to feel like a tank with the Horde mechanics.For me, the Space Marine was the only binding feature of the game, which was really a 3 -meter -tall space infantry.Your step will shake the place, kneel in front of the gariban human beings and say my lord to you and the angels of the emperor will know.Here is the pleasure of this game here.In this game, which completes its presentation with a cinematic action, it is up to us to remove the pleasure.In general, the music is beautiful, if you already like Grotesque music, the music that this game has shit in the background will bring you to the gas.As a result, optimization and cinematic performance are really nice.

The biggest aspect of the game is unfortunately the end of the story and the online pve modes are composed of sections in story mode.Random Generate Pve If we can cut horde as a huge warrior in tasks, this game will play for another 10 years.
If they color the online part a little more and the stories independent of the story come from the taste of this game inedible and will play for years more.

In summary, the kidney is given for the story mode.But if you are not very familiar with PVP mode like me, the online part does not satisfy.The giant team announced a 2 -year plan and has plans about PVA.

Although the character Customization part is not too detailed, it is satisfactory too much to make you feel the same thing.Why would I not make a assault from salamanders and put a golden yellow band on his arm?

Honestly got no idea about the space marine story or lore, but i did play some warhammer games such as vermintide 1, and 2, darktide, and this one currently.

Graphics wise the game looks great, some details are more focused on than others, but it is really nice looking.
Not sure why they went with 3 players co-op and not the usual 4 player majority of people got used to, but maybe they have their reasons.

Game running buttery smooth, 4k max settings, native resolution, no upscaling, 65+ fps all the time. PC specs 14900k, 4090, 64gb ram.

one thing they may need to improve on, but this might be due to my region, is that i dont have any nearby servers to join to, and this affects people like me in Middle East, as the least ping we saw was 87 or 94 ping, never lower.

As an Astert, players have low speed, low blood volume, low melee damage (need to be continuously stigmatized and straight enemies will be beaten), low gear returns (need to upgrade weapons), protectThe shield is low, and the shield has a long reply time (the time is re -calculated by the remote enemy, basically rely on the execution of the enemy to reply to the shield) remote weapon bullets, the full series of shotguns scrape one shuttle, a small elite, a sniper rifle, a sniper rifleThe damage was also low before the full level. Only the hot melting gun was a little intensity (only 3 occupations had this type of weapon).

The first content of 7 campaigns+6 action modes+PVP mode

The battle mode and action mode are divided into four difficulties. Novice suggests to play the lowest difficulty or ordinary difficulty.

7 battles (invited friends to play together) are full, well-made, 5-8h.

The PVP mode is only EAC's anti -cheating. It has been occupied by plug -ins. It is not recommended to play before rectifying the environment.

After the player finished playing 6 levels of the action mode, after freshness, the focus came.

If you want to experience high difficulty, you need a large amount of duration to improve the character level and weapon level, otherwise there is no gaming experience.
The experience value of the character upgrade is linked to the difficulty, low difficulty experience, and low -level characters cannot be played at all when high -level characters are not as high as high -level characters.
Weapon experience can get the highest -level weapon at least 20 times to get the highest -level weapon (each weapon needs to be brushed like this), and each weapon also needs a lot of materials to upgrade (one level can only pick up to get one material, and the BOSS can get additional to get additional obtainedone).
After clearing all 6 cooperation model levels, after reading the plot, in order to quickly improve the player's level and weapons, they basically captured the same level to repeat the running drawing brush, full of boring.(If anyone thinks repeating the same level, it is interesting, so I can only indicate that you are right)

The standard version can experience all the game content. The luxury version only has the color and pattern of the skin (the standard version can also unlock the color changes and patterns, but there are no luxury version).You can get it, but the amount of gain is very small). The ultimate additional skin has only one occupation.The armor model (note that the model is not the color) can be unlocked by just playing a certain number of times, no need to buy DLC.

As an ultimate version of grievances, my suggestion is: If you have the idea of ​​buying, it is recommended to buy the standard version and experience the plot of the battle and cooperation model (about 12-15H). Ordinary players do not need to rigid liver character level.",2024/9/14,zh-cn

The main claim to the game is that you are at least somewhat tall about the difficulties, you do not feel like a spaceport.This is a colossus that tears all his hands, in this game there is just a whiting toy.God forbid, you decided to fight in a mile fight against 2+ enemies or go out in an open field against the Renge Mobes - you will immediately have a health pole to be removed.The game seems to imply that you will fight the hordes of enemies, but there are no tools under this.In L4D you can repel, in Darctayda to repel and sterefy, to quickly run away to DIP COK.Here, if you have already been surrounded or just running after you, then you do not have an option except to get guaranteed damage.It will not work to run away, you are even caught up in the rifts.You can’t push it away, it’s not like that.It’s also impossible to bake everything either - there are few frames for this business, and there are too big things between the new Perry and the Old.You can soak the whole crowd, but while you will charge the attack, then you are just throwing you behind the cheek.The rally effect does not work as it should work.Having received damage, he gradually subsides, but you have such a delay on almost all the guns between the blows that it will not work to restore the health that you lost in the crowd.Constantly in the fight against the crowd you will sag.At the same time, we can say that the option is to confront this is a rang-armed, but this is not so, since it is all bad, it is not a little, it slows you off or is not at all capable of crowds.

Instead of playing for a super-mega tank, I seem to play for a suffocation that flies into a lobby with 1 missed poke.I do not feel any speed or reaction of Spacmarin, his strength and vitality.Rather, I feel that some kind of omeganchik was stuck with a papier-masha with a armor, while everyone around was driven in titanium alloys.

At the end of the game, I am already morally tired that the dodgers are poorly made that the mobs are not sharpened for this.The same chaos dreadnought has an attack from which it is impossible to escape, but it can be avoided with a dump, but he immediately makes another attack, so that, as they would call the Souls in Dark, to catch in the roll.

Well, pre-ordered this game as fast as possible since I saw the gameplay... it was like love at first sight, never played read anything about the universe of Warhammer 40K and I knew this was the entry point for it, didn't disappoint at all.

Positives:

-Main story is very good, for a person that didn't played the first game I get to knew Titus and understand what he did back there and that it is still haunting him.
-I didn't knew the universe of warhammer 40k but got a pretty good taste of it because of this game and I want to know MORE!
-Character development, even tho the campaign is short the characters have a good development (will not talk about it because of spoiler), specially the other 2 brothers that fight along side you.
-You can play co-op in the main story and the other mode which is super interesting, you can play your story with your brother and enjoy the masterpiece that it is.
-The Swarm technique is insane, seeing all the hundreds of monsters around and around the map without taking a huge toll in your pc performance its incredible, it feels marvelous fighting hordes of horrendous heretics without burning your pc!
-SO MUCH TESTOSTERONE ! FOR THE EMPEROR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Negatives:

-Bots-AI they get stuck sometimes
-Some visual bugs in pieces of the armor while watching a semi-cutscene, kind of distracts you
-Super short main story, around 8/9 hours which is a bummer since it was going pretty well.
-Can't customize anything in the campaign basically, it is poor the characterization of Titus and his brothers, your basically only choose which weapon to start the mission...
-It had that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing, if your pre-ordered with gold edition you got 3 or 4 days in advance which is a petty move to do in this days... no I will not pay more 30 Euros for skins and 3 days of early access.

Space Marine 2 is good in every respect!The gameplay is great, the graphics are beautiful and the soundtrack is spectacular (I would say it's the highlight of the game) and the story is very good too.Amazing setting and absurd hordes.This game is one of those few games that really put you in action.You feel inside!

An important detail: you can quietly play this single player game!But this game is much more fun if played with friends.Raise the gameplay a lot you can bounce tactics and combine positioning with friends.

He is very friendly if you did not play the first, but I recommend too much you take a basic look at the Warhammer 40k Lore because there is a lot of cool things that rolls in the game that the game does not necessarily explain to you.

It is very worth it!This universe is amazing and the game is wonderful.Few games I advise to buy at the full price and this one is one of them.",2024/9/24,pt

Epic Doom,1,9.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/epic_doom/,"A masterpiece that is so rare in today's gaming landscape - reminiscent of a time we called the ""golden age of gaming"" with absolute Warhammer 40K brutality that we all love.

Graphics
• Incredible model detail everywhere
• High fidelity and dense environments
• Loincloth physics is 👌
• World just looks amazingly beautiful - sheer scale 'shock and awe' at every horizon

Gameplay
• Simple but satisfying, much polished from Space Marine I
• Movement feels super satisfying and heavy as an Astartes should
• Gunplay is impactful and smooth, though aiming feels a bit clunky at times due to the way it's configured
• Melee is a transcendent experience, as the Emperor intended, with all the right splashes of red
• Old school gaming feel, this plays like a true Space Marine successor/sequel should


• Well-paced, Titus, Chairon, and Chadriel have some amazing moments in this campaign to save the Recidious System from annihilation by xenos and Choas scum alike
• Background characters like Major Sarkaana, Cpt. Sevastus Acheran and others aboard the battle barge were all memorable in their own rights - though many Ultramarines don the same Primaris power armour their dialogues and faces behind the suit intrigued me enough to warrant their own spin-off campaigns if possible
• World-building elements in the story campaign created a larger-than-life immersive experience, thanks to the attention-to-detail when designing the objects in the game - everything feels so authentic to the 41st millennium time period
• Epic, grand, dazzling - are all words that are too small to describe the awe I felt when finishing the campaign, it was a religious experience to say the least
• Too short, would have loved a longer campaign - easily finish-able in a day. Hopefully future expansions could be added that bring fourth more stories in this game/engine.

Overall, this was the successor to Space Marine that was worth waiting 13 years for - in fact there was a time when this game would not have been possible and to see it and play it is a blessing and a great privilege. For anyone who is a fan of the 40K universe I say this is a must buy - my only complaint is that it will leave you wanting more.",2024/9/16,en
PonyKnight,1,36.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PonyKnight/,"I must say right away that I think the first part of a very overvalued, as it was just October WH40K, but the franchise was lucky only on strategies, so even such fans were insanely happy.Unfortunately, even among the strategies, the series began problems and the DOW3 was a complete failure.Last year, the wonderful Warhammer 40000: Rogue Trader, from the Russian studio Owlcat Games, the first franchise game in a long time, which was immediately good and the first widely known good franchise RPG.This year, another Russian studio (well, or what she is now on the papers) released Space Marine 2, a game that immediately came out without special jambs and, in principle, one of the best games of the year.


The main problem of the first part was in the monotony of everything, albeit with glimpses of the beautiful architecture of temples and other things.The second part fully corrects this problem giving levels on three different planets with a very detailed environment.If on the first planet we see mainly alien jungle, then in the second and third we are driven through the city, temples and places of burials.Even the main hub is incredibly detailed and changes between missions.In the multiplayer, as in the first part, we can open new parts of the armor and make a copy of your favorite figure out of our character.Enemies were also diversified, as in the first part, these are still 2 fractions, but with a much greater variety of classes of enemies.In the game, everything is done in detail and beautifully.It’s really not to complain about the visual, the developers clearly worked a lot on it and obviously with great love.


The plot is medium long, I think that in the area of ​​10+ hours.Plus, a few more cooperative sides of tasks (operations).The whole game can be gone alone and in the coop.Even on the highest complexity, bots are useful.They will kill enemies, if you need to revive, then this will be their priority and they do not die to the end.I would like to be able to command them to attack a priority goal, but these are trifles.In principle, cooperative missions are the same as the plot in the structure of levels, but with several new mechanics and classes (each has its own main skill and a set of weapons).Only one class representative can be in the team at the same time, which, in principle, can become a problem, but more on that later.PVP mode also uses separate classes with separate armor and other.In general, the game has a lot of content and for different taste.In the future, we are promised new weapons, skins, maps and years of support.Given how the game shot, you can not worry for this, but even just a plot and a coop cost your money.


Gameplay, the combat system is quite simple and, in principle, works.Near and long -range weapons are equally important.In many similar games, strong enemies make sense to kill only in a close battle, but in SM2, you often need to use a firearm and grenades, especially against enemies with distant attacks.For the most part, we dodge and parry the attacks, finishing with animations is needed to replenish the reservation, so you will often have to finish the animations and this is not enough, but in principle this does not become a strong problem.In the coope, the classes have trees of pumping, so the grind fans will do something in addition to opening armor and flowers.In general, as I said, the gameplay works and he is norms, not a new word in the genre, but also not dull.


I believe that the game has some problems with the balance on the highest complexity, the weakest enemies with distant attacks, too much inflict damage and very often.Zoanthropes are generally the strongest opponents in the game, which are too good in everything.But these are, in principle, not big problems, I consider the abundance of downloads a big one.In order to go into any game mode, in the beginning you have to boot into the hub of which you already choose what to play in the terminal.The hub, of course is very beautiful, but at the 25th hour I really want the opportunity to do it all from the main menu.You can’t configure normally normally, if you want to connect to the already started by the game or not, you connect to the team and only after that you see what classes they have, and as a result, the expectation of someone can change the class.I really hope that in the future it will be corrected.The second problem is that even in a single game you are always connected to the servers and if during a single company with bots you have chopped off the Internet, the game offers you to play offline, but throws you to the last control point, which is very annoying.


WH40K fans have been eating very well for the second year in a row.Not just a good game, but one of the best this year and generally one of the best in the franchise.With proper support, she will live with a large number of players for many years.One of the rare cases when the developers tried to make a bunch of everything and they did it.Of course I would like to have a in-game wiki for beginners, as if you will be rushed into incomprehensible words, but these are trifles.I hope that in the future, the main menu will add the opportunity to choose the modes of the game and so on, but otherwise, the gloomy future of the game looks very promising.",2024/9/14,ru

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a long -awaited sequel that is expected and followed by the fans of the first game.The action -packed and intense war atmosphere in the first game continues in this game, but this time new mechanics, advanced graphics and a deeper story.

Graphic and atmosphere
Space Marine 2 is visually impressive.The game successfully reflects the dark and gothic aesthetics of the Warhammer 40K universe.The atmosphere of the game is incredibly intense with detailed environmental design, huge battlefields and creepy designs of Tyranids.Thanks to the ""Swarm Engine"", which was previously used in the ""World War Z"" game, character animations and explosions look realistic and impressive.In particular, the blood and disintegration effects, which are used in abundance, make the Space Marine 2 into a visual feast.

Gameplay
In terms of gameplay, Space Marine 2 maintains the action -packed style of the first game.Again, as a Space Marine, you enter the epic battles against Tyranids.Using iconic Warhammer weapons such as close fighting weapons, heavy machine guns and plasma weapons makes war scenes even more excited.High -paced, bloody wars keep the spirit of the first game alive.However, thanks to the newly added combo and more fluent control mechanics, the fights have become much more fluent and enjoyable.

The diversity of enemies is also very impressive.Different species of Tyranids offer various war scenarios, each requiring different tactics.The huge boss wars add an epic feeling to the game.

Story and atmosphere
The depth of the Warhammer 40K universe is reflected in the story of the game.The story is shaped around our main character Titus, and we see it fighting against the Tyranide invasion.The atmosphere of the game gives a very gloomy and intense feeling with the combination of gothic sci -fi and chaos.This atmosphere will be a big plus, especially for players who dominate the Warhammer universe.

Multiplayer mode
As in the first game, the multiplayer mode is one of the most exciting aspects of Space Marine 2.It is quite satisfactory and fun to fight against huge tyranid herds with your friends.In addition, equipment and character customizations in cooperative mode diversify the multiplayer part of the game.The PVP is also a pleasant pleasant.Especially if you are bored of fast-pace games such as COD, low tempo, slow coveremen and team-based conflicts will be like medicine.

Conclusion
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a sequel designed to satisfy the fans of the first game and reinforced with new generation technologies.High -paced action, war scenes offering visual feast and the dark atmosphere of the Warhammer 40K universe makes the game a successful experience.Even for those who are not familiar with the 40K universe, Warhammer draws attention as an action game full of intense war mechanics and impressive visuals.

Both the design of scene art and interstellar warrior are very good in line with the style of war hammer 40K. For fans with 40K war hammer 40K, this may be the most circled and the number of war hammer 40K IP masterpieces.
The plot task process is about 8-10 hours, and the simple difficulty may be shorter

But the disadvantage of this game is also very obvious:
1. The plug -in of PVP still exists. The little lazy bear has not played any effective effect, but now it has become rare as the number of online people decreases.
2. PVE's low -character performance, such as the shield of paper paste that will disappear by the shield that will be interrupted, rolling without invincible frames, the mobs are caught twice.It also determines that failure, barrels and warriors, etc., can make players hard straight, etc.
3. The difficulty setting of the PVE is unreasonable. In order to increase the difficulty of N3 and N4, it is actually a rude multiples to increase the value of the monster and greatly reduce the number of supply.The location, and sometimes the team composition is mainly in the case of melee, and is forced to escape directly; however, the official announcement has said that the value of the monster will be reduced in the future.
4. There are too few PVE content, there are only six maps, and the high difficulty is basically only a specific two pictures.

Gameplay is fine and solid, a pretty enjoyable combat system. Story is exactly what you'd expect, graphics are fine. That's about it.

Optimalization is very subpar.
Connection to online services is very spotty, you'll get stuck at loading screens, disconnected, the ping is not great, etc. It's all hosted on epic online services so go figure.
No FOV slider.
Veteran difficulty does not really make you feel like a space marine, one difficulty level lower is way too easy.

Tyranid section:
Enemies shoot through walls CONSTANTLY, that one elevator section in particular is awful - you have to one-shot it, otherwise after dying you cannot pick-up any medkits/ammo/weapons/etc., it all gets bugged. (reloading the level is not very optimal, the loading screens are so long)
The long-ranged enemies are insanely strong and don't give you too much indication that they are shooting at you. The bigger long-ranged enemies are bullet sponges.
The lyctor boss was underwhelming, repetetive and quite easy. The ""minigun/shotgun"" type enemies the boss spawned in were 100x harder than he was (they melt you down to zero HP in one good burst). They re-use him after as a normal enemy, actually much more fun.
The section with the small critters and the flamethrower was a cool concept but executed extremely poorly - it was more annoying than fun.
The flying enemies have way too much HP.
Teammates missing cutscenes, only see a black screen instead.
The bosses are so uninspired, filled with enemy spam because they are not worth it to fight on their own.

Great game, like a sip of fresh air, after summer without games.For the first time you go and see a good picture and large -scale battles of guards with tyranids.Huge locations, the infrastructure of the Imperium, the guards holding to the last - this is that it is very necessary for the Warhammer fan, you can look at the details for a long time, because there are a lot of them, even though the company is small.

In parallel with the company, there is a plot of PVE of missions and this is very cool.That is, not only Titus with a detachment cuts out 99% of enemies, other brothers from the order also perform no less important tasks, such as banging a tyrant of the hive or raising a ship and demolishing the artifact of thousands of thousands.There is an opportunity to fight with rubricates (finally not Nurlit), this is very non-standard.

PVP is not very, you need to finalize.Cosmetics are so -so, cool in certain classes of loyalists (especially in bastion, tactics and raener).The idea with the Legions of Chaos IMBA, but spoils its complete absence of cosmetics.The developers promise to add a lot and finish a lot to the game, so in anticipation)",2024/9/17,ru

Lucky us. Can't recommend for a sixty dollar price tag, unless you wait for some patches when you can't even get out of the opening without troubleshooting.

Edit after 15 hours played.

The sluggishness in the cinematic cutscenes can really dampen the intended effect of awe at the things you get to see in this game up close from the amazing 40k universe. The game is worth it.. but maybe wait a while for them to fix some of their bugs, since their mentality seems to be they believe it's ""rare"" to encounter these issues. Both me and hubby ran this and had the same exact issues on completely different machines, and when you see you've experienced every issue on their bug list that has ""rare"" listed for the bug occurances as much as there are bugs in the game.. well.

For anyone having the same issue I and hubby had with the game where it wouldn't load the first opening cutscene, among others. Try disabling any overlays you have including steam overlay. Game doesn't really seem to like it much. Good luck fellow Astartes, The Emperor protects.

Many more hours in and I learn the game has finally gotten its private lobby systems.. along with a whole new host of bugs. Love the game, but its got some issues.

The designers have really been able to transcribe the entire atmosphere of the 42nd millennium.
The games are teeming with details that will delight the real fan of the GW universe.

2. sometimes long but acceptable loading times.
3. A perfectible camera locking.
4. ... which fades after a hundred times.In addition, in veteran mode, it is almost necessary, to do executions to avoid damage.Because there are few cutlery and care is almost nonexistent (in veteran mode) except the special capacity which is not often available).It may be much easier ... in easy ...

- 3 game modes on launch. Even if Eternal War has some server issues, having more options on launch is good. Operations will get fleshed out further based on roadmap being posted by devs, so there'll be even more content to dig through later.
- Combat feels pretty good! The default control scheme on mouse and keyboard is a little whack, but you get used to it (or you can change it). Only thing is you *will* get animation trapped sometimes. It just happens.
- Visceral executions are a delight to watch

Cons:
- Story is fine I guess, any complaints I have are spoilers.
- Enemy variety is a little low.
- The AI for your two squadmates in solo-Campaign are *not* okay. They suck ass. Will frequently not target enemies, not execute stunned enemies, will not target enemies attacking objectives, sometimes won't even res you if you go down. Play with friends, or play on Easy (game doesn't have achievements for beating campaign on set difficulties, just for beating campaign at all) because playing on the hardest difficulty without friends has a few very acute pain points in the story. Otherwise, game isn't actually that hard.
- Eternal War (PvP) mode is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Time to kill is way too short, and there seems to be no rails on who you can get match-making into. So if you're a new guy into the PvP mode, you can get matched with people with all - and I mean *all* - the unlocked gear and get totally ♥♥♥♥ on until you catch up. Which can take a while, given you're getting ♥♥♥♥ on. This mode needs a rework, ASAP.
- The pay to get early access was scummy. Wish companies would stop this ♥♥♥♥.
- Performance issues; I've got an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 16GB of RAM, and a 1080Ti. Game runs well enough but has some serious hangups once in a while even on Low settings. Possibly just lag from people joining/leaving sessions, but it's hard to tell if it's my hardware or the network. I'm overdue for an upgrade, so this might be an entirely *me* problem.
- Solo queueing into Operations is a similar annoyance in lack of team cohesion that solo-ing into LFD2 or *any* co-op PvE will bring you. People will run ahead, ignoring enemies, letting teammates die, just to try and run the level as fast as possible. Annoying as ♥♥♥♥, as it always is.

I would like to start by saying that, I don't like Warhammer or anything related to it, from the figurine painting, to the books, and the table-top game. But my partner is a Warhammer nerd who also has a bunch of friends who are into it as well. When they have their Warhammer playtime I call them the 40k cult.

Anyway my partner showed me the trailer of space marine II which didn't seem too bad, and it's co-op so I decided to give it a try. Space marine II is surprisingly good. I never thought I would actually enjoy something related to Warhammer.

Anyway I don't know if it's related to my AMD card but the game keep crashing. In one session about an hour into the game it crashed 4 times. I've updated everything related to AMD and followed some tips from people having the same issue as me but nothing worked. I mean if that doesn't show how determined I am. I don't know what does. I know they are releasing a patch end of September so hopefully whatever it's creating the crash issue will be fixed.
My partner uses NVIDIA/Intel and he had no problems while gaming.

- Lack of content.I took pre -order and gave it for the game 4.5k.In my opinion, the game is not worth that money.Wait until it is filled, or take it at a discount.
- A terrible network code.He played with friends, there were frequent breaks, long downloads and the inability to connect to the network.I heard that all Saber games had such problems, I hope to correct it.

I am into warhammer for well over 20 years. I own basicly every 40k game there is from psp Squad Command to Chaos Gate for windows 95. I am an absolute Fanboi, there is no way to call it otherwise. I am a true nerd on that subject. Read the Books, watched the Films/Shows (Yes, the 80s VHS Movies and Warhammer+ Content). I own several Armies and collect the various army books since 2nd Edition.

With that out of the Way I can truly say, this game is a loveletter from the Developers to the Hardcore Fanbois. And I hereby and with my Purchase thank them for this absolutely Gorgeous game.

The 40k IP has been treated mixed. We had some great Games like Battlefleet Gothic, Dawn of War 1-2(not 3 though), some mediocre Stuff like Mechanicus (The OST is fire though), Rogue Trader and alot of Terrible Games. (Dawn of War 3, Storm of Vengance, The Mobile Games, Eternal War).

I am a Gamer for most of my life. Burnt my fingers on more Games I was exited about then I care to admit. I was very cautios with this one. I really hoped it would be atleast ""ok´ish"" and was very sceptical when I saw that ""Play 4 days Earlier for 40€"" nonsense. But boy, this game restored a bit of my Faith in the Gaming Industry.

Over the course of the last 10-15 years I watched a noticeable decline. For me, personaly, AAA was utter trash with a 60-80€ Price Tag. Indie Games where the stuff to go for and I havent Bought Anything from any ""Big Publisher"" for over 10 Years (Allright, with the exception of Anno 1800 and I regret that, but that does not belong here).

This Game is exactly what was modern Gaming was Missing. Its a Joyride, feature complete game on day 1. Not one of those games, and you know wich one I mean, wich turn into Games as a Service or thats actually ""Finished"" 2-3 Years AFTER release.

Hell, even if you´re not a total 40k nut like me, this game will blast you Away. The Story/Singleplayer Campaign is a 8-12 Hours long, 90s testoterone filled action Movie. Filled with a world to dive in, a world that engages you and makes you Forget your Job and all your Problems in Life. Its a Rollercoaster Ride you will remember in the Years to come.

The Game is full of Content. While most Publishers would´ve went the Lazy way and Recycle the Singleplayer for the Coop experience, this game offers a whole new set of Missions bound into the Story. That says alot. Ubisoft would´ve sold this as a several Game.

By the dark Gods, everytime I thought they hit the climax, they pushed it from 10/10 to 11/10 and in the End even to 12/10. I am glad Games like this still are made.

My Heretic heart jumps with Joy.

Game system, especially reviews will be written around PVE mode.
* There is a little spoiler

General commentary
If you want to enjoy the series fans, the sense of presence and the world, those who are tired of the character that tends to be in recent shooters, or to lovers soul -based shooters.
I regret buying it because I think it's a hord shooter and I don't recommend it.At least it didn't suit me.
He had the impression that he had forced the horn shooter, the soul, and the hunt, but as a horn shooter, the upper enemy was too hard and there were too many small fish enemies for soul and hunt.

What I think is good
1: You can customize the armor quite well (the character itself is fixed with a unusual uncle who plays the role, but it is good)
2: A sense of presence from the solid world view
3: A refreshing finisher can be fired repeatedly

What I thought it didn't suit me
Overall game
1: If you make it a head -like soul -like that seemed to be a horn shooter, you will be able to do it immediately
2: The movement is light (I think it has a solid feeling to some extent, but a little too much, stress on a large crowd)
3: There is no gap between the top enemies from inside, and if it is a 1vs hunter like a game that hunts a certain monster, it may be fine, but there is a large amount of small fish enemies and long -range attacks from all sides.Title
4: This gun is just a bean gun, but the enemy flies and flies to the sky, which is simply boring.
5: There are few weapons that are suitable for the horde, and there are some things that can strengthen the penetration of bullets by doing their best and raising their levels, but I didn't think I would do that.
6: At the time of writing this review, I feel that the armor is too nervous and the means of recovering physical strength is too limited, so I personally like games that can be enjoyed more easily, so I didn't fit me.

Terminid
1: The upper enemy is too hard and the power of this gun is delicate and there is no exhilaration, feeling like shooting a sponge.
2: The upper enemy floats has no gap, has a lot of physical strength, has a lot of barrier, and shoots a long -range attack.
3: The lower enemies fall on their own if they defeat all the middle enemies around them, but the most important middle enemies appear in Barrett sponge and quite a group.

chaos
1: Even if the middle enemy is stiff and shoots with a gun, it runs away by teleport even if you hit it, and the enemy shoots infinitely from all sides.To be clear, shit
2: There is a shield in the lower enemies, and it often springs up in a considerable number of people.Fucking
3: The high -end humanoid long -range type does not flicker, and it is infinite high -heat.Fucking
4: I don't like the color.Fucking

Starting with the good/okay aspects.

The atmosphere in this game is truly incredible, you feel completely immersed in the 41st millennium and the sound design and animations are gorgeous.

The campaign is a solid 6.5/10 it is quite literally, just the first games story, rehashed slightly, complete with fun and interesting enemy, who you get to fight for too short of an amount of time, before the tedious and boring one. It fulfilled the power fantasy and was a compelling enough story that once it kicked off I wanted to see it through as quickly as possible.

The PVE Operations are the strength of this game by far, it is a lot of fun playing with two friends and earning gear and unlocking perks. I look forward to seeing how they expand on it.

Now for my issues with the game.

Customization is hidden behind a grind, which is fine, progression isn't inherently bad, however, the way you unlock emblems and color palettes feels needlessly convoluted, they can only be unlocked in a specific order once you pick a faction and the currency used to unlock things is shared with the PVE game mode perks, and the weapon skins making it a bit grindy. These customization options are really cool! But don't think you can place that particular Iron Warriors Skull on your RIGHT pauldron, I am afraid that one is restricted to the LEFT pauldron only. That really cool metallic you found that would be perfect for your chapter's main color? Sorry, that is a tertiary color only, it can be used for trim and nothing else.
Speaking of traitor marines, the customization for them is basically non existent (On a side note, after customizing my marine, I have played 12 straight games of Chaos where I can't see it, which is hilarious).

PvP is okay, but it feels more like a demo for the game mode that has yet to be released. There are only 3 maps, and 3 game modes. The classes all feel well made and overall balanced. Close combat however feels like it has the depth of a puddle, it is generally whoever lands the first attack wins. Parrying does nothing but block damage, there is no stagger, no window for you to attack back, your opponent can just keep flailing away and you must hope a teammate comes to your rescue. I think utilizing the very fun parry system in the campaign would've been a slam dunk and added depth. I mostly play sniper so this isn't hugely impactful for me, but still.

I could go on more, but honestly this game feels more like a demo than a full release, which is crazy to say after a decade of waiting. I will continue to play here and there with friends because I love the universe, but if this game was anything other than 40k I would not be playing it at all.",2024/9/21,en

The immersion is total; you are the embodiment of my wrath, and for that, I commend the creators.+

+But let it not be said that my judgment is blind to faults. The enemies, while numerous and suitably grotesque, are repetitive in their design, much like the countless masses of orks and tyranids I have destroyed over millennia. Their minds are as predictable as the winds of Cadia before its fall. And though the combat is fierce and satisfying, there is a rhythm to it that one may find tiresome after enough time. Yet I understand the limitations of mortal creativity, and I am forgiving.+

+Where the game shines, however, is in the portrayal of the Adeptus Astartes. Each blow, each strike feels heavy with the weight of a thousand years of warfare, and each step resounds with the thundering presence of an unstoppable force. You are no mere man in this world, but a demigod among men, and the gameplay reflects that truth in glorious fashion.+

+The story, though not as intricate as the weave of fate I have spun for humanity, serves its purpose. It is a tale of defiance in the face of oblivion, a tale the galaxy knows all too well. Titus stands, as all Space Marines must, as the last bulwark against annihilation. Though his struggles are but a fragment of the grand narrative, they are a necessary reminder of the eternal struggle against darkness.+",2024/9/20,en

First off, the graphics? Stunning. The environments are drenched in that grimdark aesthetic we all crave. You step onto the battlefield, and it’s like stepping into a painting, only this one’s drenched in blood and glory. You can almost taste the power oh, how I love that taste!

Metuz,1,87.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vinceh/,"As of writing this review I have never been more torn on whether to recommend a game or not.

The campaign has moments which will make Warhammer fans giddy like a kid at Christmas, especially on the last two missions (if you've played it you know.) Even non Warhammer fans will have a good time with this. The voice acting, graphics and audio are all strong.
However, it's criminally short. Took me about 5.5 hours to complete and I died...a lot.

The AI in this game is something out of 2004. Squad mates will watch you getting annihilated and not budge an inch, or decide to stand in front of you as you attempt to lay waste to heretics. It's infuriating, and something you'll need to get used to because the online matchmaking in SM2 is straight up cheeks. I hope you enjoy restarting your game a lot, and loading screens, because you'll become familiar with both.

Bugs, crashes, loooong loading times, and infinite loading times are going to likely infest your experience worse than any Tyranid could, and this after the game was already pushed back a considerable amount of time.

The core game play of SM2 is really solid. Any third person shooter fans, especially those that enjoyed Gears of War are going to have a great time. It's challenging, brutal and unapologetic in it's approach. It knows it's target audience and swings for the fences, and most of the time it connects.

This game will live or die in the next 3-6 months on how much the Dev will support it.
Fixing the myriad of tech issues, and bringing more content to coop and multiplayer. More maps are needed, it's a non-negotiable.

SM2 is a real mixed bag. A frustrating, disappointing mixed bag all within a room filled with potential. This could be something truly special but it's not there...yet.

I'm going to reluctantly recommend it purely because I'm a Warhammer fan, and there are moments in this game that are perfection, but as a non Warhammer fan wait for a sale. By that time you'll have a feel for how many of the issues have been fixed, and what the landscape is looking like with more content to make it worthwhile.",2024/9/17,en
Die Happy,1,129.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/die_happy/,"So 80 Hours in this game features 3 distinct parts.


TLDR: game looks and sounds great, very true to source material

campaign story is decent but nothing to write home about. great spectical but obviously parts were cut from it. maybe not enough time, still good fun, specially in coop.

PVE mode 3 player coop in style of darktide, L4F etc, has a lot of meat to sink your teeth into, customisation, leveling etc.

PVP more 6vs6 with 3 game modes and 3 maps. fun but lacking a lot of content and is a 2010 style shooter.

BUY if you like the PVE or PVP campaign is not worth the full price

LONG VERSION

outside of PVP the gameplay is a 3rd person shooter where you can often run out of ammo but that where melee comes in. this has a whole melee system with attack combos, blocking parrying, doging in it. kind of like the lastes god of war games. if you take damage you lose armor which regenerates after 30 seconds or you can execute enemies to get some back. when out or armor you loose health which you can get back by doing damage a short time after taking it. like in bloodbourne. if you miss that short mindow there are me packs that restore some health and some classes can get health back r hel other with it.

so now you run around and 20 small enemies + a handfull elites leading them show up. you shoot and melee the hell out of them taking damage, regenerating armour by executing which also give you i-frames. blocking, doging parrying etc. with enough pratice it becomes a dance of death. which can be really fun when you get into ""the flowstate"" of the combat.

a single player campaign:
playable with up to 3 players in coop. this is the main story. features no progression or leveling or armor customisation. the story is and plot is ok. nothing fancy but servicable. in terms of looks and sound its great though. bombastic and warhammer as hell. depending on your difficulty you will play this for about 8-10 hours. good for one playthough but thats it. there are a lot of shooters that deliver a better story. but the spectacle is here.

adjacent to the campaign is the operations mode:

you play 3 marines can choose from 6 diffent classes featuring unique skills and skill trees ofthen even unique weapons. you play 3 player coop missions kind of like darktide, left 4 dead etc. with a director that keeps thing fresh and sets up enemy spawns etc.

this mode features full leveling of weapons and classes with skill trees with 4 difficulty levels. this is where i spend 90% of my playtime. leveling different classes and their weapons earning ingame currency to buy their gear and customize their armor look from the 9 loyalist legions + a plethora of 1st and second founding astartes chapters. armor visual customization looks really good. in this mode i have arnound 60-70 hours and have maxed 4 of the 6 classes but often just a handfull of their available weapons.


next is the 6vs6 pvp modes, it is disconnected from the other modes in terms of progression and although you have the same classes some skills are slightly different and you only unlock weapon loadouts & cosmetics. there are no skilltrees or weapon skill trees. you also earn ingamemoney you can use in the operations mode to unlock new cosmetics and weapons.

you play loyalist vs traitors while for loyalist you can customize way the traitors models are locked in in terms of model but you can customize colors & emblems. so for example the vanguard is always a world eater, the heavy always death guard. but you can color them differently.

3 game modes, deathmatch, domination and capture and hold. on only 3 maps.
the game modes are fine, the maps are fine but it is all very COD 2010. spawncamping can easily happen. matchmaking isnt great. the melee system is gutted compared to pve modes, you can parry and block but besides negating damage but you dont get an advantage for it over the enemy. thoug melee ignores armor. besides that you regenerate armor faster than in pve and even heal quite fast.
it is fun but has its problems lacking content and using dated mechanics.

still very fun game and if you play the PVE coop mode or enjoy the PVP you can get a lot of hours out of it.
if you are only here for the campaign. better way for a sale.",2024/9/16,en

Quackers,0,52.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/QuackerCracker/,"Please realise that this is literally one of the only games I've been looking forward to for a very very long time. I was hoping of actually enjoying a game for the first time in months, just for everything I feared to manifest after more than just a few hours of gameplay. Initially I thought the game was phenomenal, the weighty thump of the bolters, the tearing viscera of chainswords, the diverse abilities and a 2010s storyline packed with an explosive finale. I finished the game on the 2nd highest difficult, as reccomended, and wanted to try out more gameplay.

So I decided to play outside of the story mode.

The highest difficulty, Ruthless, shows the true colors of this game. After breezing through the first three difficulties and getting my class to high level, more issues began to arise as I became more intent on progressing my weapons. That's when the most glaring problems began to show; the combat is incredibly clunky with parries and snapshots almost guaranteeing you will be hit by 2-3 other enemies if you take them. The enemies themselves are monotonous to fight against with less AI responsiveness than even Halo Reach had, a game 14 years old. There's only six operation missions in total that most of them range from tedious to straight out not fun (people know the agony of the Heldrake mission while playing as Assault/Vanguard/Bulwark). The assault fails in any degree of melee, despite being for its namesake an ""assaulting"" class to get into close combat, meanwhile the fully-ranged heavy's best weapon is its close range multi-melta. PvP is a mess with a TTK that feels either like I'm playing HLL/Squad but swaps to Halo Reach but everyone has armor lock in an instant. Trying to play the campaign again shows how much the story was the definition of a one-time experience with much of the plotholes and abandoned storylines showing far more glaringly on the second playthrough. Almost all the weaponry is borderline identical save for the melta which is the only usable weapon in high level Operations, of which you will probably be kicked if you aren't using a melta or playing Bulwark 60%%+ of the time. The lack of mechanical flow in the melee kills any degree of skill-based gameplay with even using core mechanics like parrying and snapshots working against you 90% of the time by opening yourself up to other attacks for a solid 1+ second. In melee you are entirely powerless against any more than 3-4 enemies even if its just gaunts or tzaangors. Of which, even the most minor of enemies take several shots/hits to even stagger them (again, unless you use a melta). Tack all of this onto a subpar overall multiplayer experience with three total maps, 60-90+ second load times on a current-gen PC, an AI that would barely function as a support chatbot on a corporate website, borderline unfair enemy spawns (neurothrope vs melee-centric teams), ranged enemies that you can't even see shooting through entire buildings and walls, and to cap it all off I can't even play as a custom or my favourite chapter without hearing them recite a voice line about Ultramar or the Guilliman every 15 seconds.

It feels like they were rushed to do the bare minimum to call it a ""complete"" game, but failed to do any quality testing beyond the initial gameplay mechanics. These are all things they can, and I hope certainly will, fix in a few weeks to months of patches, but if you want a complete list of changes I would suggest and that I've seen others propose, you can read them below.

- Add I-Frames to parry/snapshots like executions currently have
- Have melee regenerate small amounts of HP on kill or increase the current healing mechanic in melee dramatically as stimpacks are way too far and few between while having no real way of getting HP back
- Nerf the melta's HP regen while buffing ranged HP regen hit (You can go from 1-100% HP in a single shot of melta vs getting maybe 10-15% of your HP back with a bolter)
- Remove the stagger from the melta (I don't think anyone can argue that having a melta on Ruthless makes the game 10x easier when the enemies can't even swing back and hordes disappear in 1-2 shots)
- Increase practically all bolter damage to actually be a real bolter and annihilate soft targets in 1-2 shots
- Rework Operations Assault entirely - Copy/pasting the current PvP Assault mechanics onto Operations, make the hammer viable with faster swings/heavies, make the fist viable by doing massive single-target damage
- Add more boss-oriented Operations or alternative endings (the final boss fight in the campaign was 10/10 and the Hive Tyrant was pretty good as well)
- More melee weapons that actually feel different. A power axe for anti-elites, eviscerator for anti-horde, and so on.
- More hordes. There's too many times where I feel like I'm fighting a probing force rather than an entire hive invasion fleet.
- Make walls actually solid and ranged enemy attacks not go through them (pretty obvious)",2024/9/18,en

For nothing that corridors -corridors are everything very beautifully done, a lot of details, the game is certainly not a benchmark, but I definitely want to praise for graphony, juicy, bloody, dynamically.
Shooting is much better than in the first part, in principle, I probably shot 2/3 of the game than in a hand -to -hand (played in a coop, and there was someone to mess with swords).The arsenal is diverse, there are for different enemies, with different chips, but there are no wow from guns, they simply fulfill their purpose.It’s convenient and fun to shoot while there are tyranes, but a little boring.On the gamepad, by the way, the management did not like the management at all, uncomfortable, played on clamps.
“Ulta” now is different for all characters, useful in their own way, does not develop in any way.Bestiary is diverse enough for not very long passage.The meat grinder is meat, weapons of near -battle have even a pair of simple combo.

Operations.Coope of the mission with pumping its class.At the moment there are 6 of them, after 60 hours spent in them, I want to continue to recall them.In the future, of course, we are waiting for new tasks.

A seasonal pass with a price tag 2199. For a comfortable game, you do not need it since this is a set of cosmetics, but the price is for it, I personally scares me.I understand that this is not extra money for developers, but still this is the price of some games.
The new game content at the request of the developers will be free.

Well, a spoon of tar.
At the moment, servers are bad.The same bastion feels unpleasant on the front line with the lags.Yes, and others are not easier.Fortunately, this is all fixable, we are waiting for a patch.

Here you embody a overseas, those gentlemen dressed as if they were a space wedding but, instead of giving towels or watches, they bring pure destruction.Boom!Pum!CLAng!You are going out there by releasing swords, shots and philosophical comments such as: ""Death is true peace, but in the meantime ... take!""The plot is the least.The important thing is: how many bugs can you crush before your monitor asks for a break?

ZTyoho,0,57.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198201426425/,"Summary: Non -fans only buy the standard version of the minimum difficulty. The battle for single players is good. It is recommended to discount, because it is not worth the price.

The single -player battle is indeed cool, without numerical growth, and no professional restrictions.The appearance can be limited. At present, only the right shoulder armor and two weapon skin can be used in single -player campaign.

Many people have serious balance issues. As soon as the PVP is smashed, a quasi -PVE finds this.I will not say much about my PVP.The PVE weapon value has a paradoxic paradox. Gold guns have to fight the highest difficulty but it is difficult to hit the highest difficulty ... Only professional talents and appearance painting can be used to be full.In addition, this game season ticket is only qualified for you. The content itself is all coated with appearance, and you must buy it by your own liver gold coins.The benefit is that at least you have nothing to do with the strength (laughs).

Compared with the first generation, the role performance does not retreat. There are too many negative feedback in the level of the level of the PVE wasteland. The key talent of many occupations to change the game experience is too late. The role performance is not growing.return.The resources of ammunition packages are short of resources, but the enemy has various bullying dogs. The melee can block the bullets but the blood volume of the enemy group evaporates instantly.The firearms other than the hot -hanging grenade of the hot melt and the grenades can not make the enemy hard, and interrupting the enemy's behavior is the most critical factor for survival in the game. This has led to most weapons.The charging laser has become a special attack on BOSS because of numerical supermodels.At present, the status quo of PVE is not that a certain weapon is easy to use, but it cannot be played without a certain minority installation.

In terms of network, the country is difficult to use, and the accelerator may not be used, and the online system is very stupid. There is almost no abnormal self -test. The drop must return to the title interface to register.Once you are interrupted with the homeowner during the matching phase, at least you need to switch the single -player mode before cutting back to the strange machine soul soothing ceremony. Otherwise, you will match the air rotation again, and you will not wait for teammates for 40,000 years.

In general, the volume of the single -player campaign in this game is insufficient. The growth curve of multiple people is steep, the fresh period is short, the anti -cheating shape is the same, the cost of obtaining the positive feedback is high, the length of time and depth of the study is very shallow.Essence",2024/9/14,zh-cn

A screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
By: pastor

I’ll start with the fact that the visual in the game is just a fairy tale, and I say not only for the technical part but also for the development of locations, everything is done in the most detailed and cool, for a long time I did not focus on the backdrops honestly in the game.

The hemplex is also as simple as possible, but from the same no less spectacular. The solarmous close battle, as well as good shooting, let us feel their dominance over the others 100%. The game is not long and the gemple simply does not have time to get bored, you are highly caught up to the credits.
The plot is ordinary, without any combination, simple to disgrace, but it is played gorgeously in the form of well -adjusted rollers and dialogs during the mission, so it suited me completely, I did not expect some kind of drama or intrigue from this game.
I liked how they passed the spirit of this universe, the atmosphere and immersion at a very good level. Consider the power of the armor when the space marine is coming, or how everyone revere owes before us and is glad to our appearance very well conveys the spirit of this universe.",2024/9/22,ru

are bigger highlight is without contest are gameplay!
For me it's a good game but not at this price (when it is released)
A most classic campaign or even old school which can be a bias!But after I find that certain negative points comes out in my opinion
- Maps PvP frankly very trivial very bland without interest for me
It is a game that would have deserves to be inspired by the best in it is a good dose of inuluence at the overwatch would have been I think a good moove
- The PVE when A he has his exit to a campaign of a dozen hour and an operation mode with only 6 cards which take up the card of the countryside is really very very light I find !!
In view of the license and the inexhaustible Lor we could clearly and objectively expect better
Because yes certain try-hardware in a few hours have already punctuated all the content (co-op included)
It is a game in view of its richness where we could have expected open maps with vehicles a little at the destiny!
in short there would still be so much to say
This is to advise this game yes but wait for a price drop or that the content is strongly ettoffed I doubt that you survive and I the first has more than a hundred hours to its current content without past to something else onceYou will have unlocked 60 % of the game Repetitiveness and replayability will be right for you quickly!
A good game that is worth less than 30 euros in the current state so if you interest you expect a little for all the reasons mentioned above otherwise if you are a fan-boys and that repetition and its lack of content does not generate younot jump on it

The game ""Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine"" was able to steam it again.A rolling level of drive, linear passage, a good plot without unnecessary troubles.The fact that you need to relax after working an hour of another behind the game.
And now I happened to play ""Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2"".I admit, there were fears that the second part of the game, as is often the case with the ""Hammer of the War"", will be an order of magnitude worse than the first.But as one movie hero said - ""I was once not so mistaken.""
To begin with, the developers did not re -""invent the bicycle.""In fact, we have the same “Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine” only incredible, and most importantly competently, improved.Before us is the same Captain Titus (only in the second part he is a lieutenant).Our task, without unnecessary troubles, go forward and destroy everyone who wants to destroy you in their path.The main enemies in the second part are tyranides.And if the orcs from the first part fled to you dozens, then the tyranides will run on you hundreds, from which the drive level takes off to space heights.As in the first part, the forces of chaos will meet on your way, in the second part represented by the ""thousand sons.""
Visual and sound effects, here as they say - ""My respect!""The game world does not look so empty as in the first part, here the guards are not embarrassed to use military equipment, and many other visual chips, and the illusions of the ""thousands"" look just bombic.
The plot, as well as the first part, is quite interesting, there are many chips, and characters from books,

Negative aspects in my opinion:
-2 When you try to enter the operation when you give you a boat, if you enter the lobby with you 2 boots with you.
Maybe I could not find such a setting when I thought that my room is closed online or my room is only for friends and looked at the settings.

-No matter what the class you do, you can find yourself playing a class you don't want when you match automatically.

-difficulty of operation mode: The difficulties of operation modes are increasing significantly after the middle level you feel that the game is difficult, especially compared to this, there is no increase in the resistance of your character.I think the more powerful cosmetic opening would be healthier.

-Powance mode is incredibly less, but I hope I will not stand on the game because the game is just coming out, more maps will come and diversity.

-When we kill the creates, I wish the blood that jumped on us would not go on time, at least when we used HEAL, it would be much better if the blood was cleaned, because our armor in the blood started to shine with a little calm and I hope I don't like it very much.

① Star Warrior 2 is a TPS+ACT action adventure game with 40K war hammer 40K as the IP background.The player played the previously charged Tatus company commander to the Extreme Warrior, and continued to fight for the Emperor, fighting with the Tylan Zerg and chaos, and poured the anger of the emperor.The game is still a refreshing style, but the overall screen specifications and battlefield scene shaping have been greatly improved.It is also a rare high -specification and game design that does not cross -cross the hammer 40K works, and the game also supports the online PVE action mode and the PVP combat mode. Although the stand -alone battle and the other two gameplay processes are not long, the content is relatively relatively, and the content is relatively relatively good.Not so fulfilling, but it is also a rare refreshing hammer tour.If it is not a hammer powder, it may be around 8 points, but if it is a war hammer fan, it is definitely a masterpiece that is definitely worth playing.

② The game specifications of the game highlight a sufficient funds. The first orc is actually very cool, but due to the development of funds and the restrictions of the game engine at that time, the battlefield was not so magnificent.And this time the second generation can be called a big leap.The game art style is full. Whether it is a peculiar building in various 40K backgrounds, the wonderful universe and the sub -space scene, even the texture of Astart's armor itself has a grade.As a hammer powder, I really saw the screenshot and appreciated, all kinds of goosebumps.In particular, the kind of battlefields are everywhere to combine the surrounding and lined buildings and wonderful universe vision. It can only be said that it is too romantic.Basically, whether the game is mobilized or Astart mobilization, and various battlefields such as deserters, there are many details, and many places have stopped for a long time.The gameplay gameplay is actually not much different from the previous one, and it is relatively inclined to melee, but this time it has added melee combat elements, and it also emphasizes that the execution of the killing will affect the battlefield.Amazing) But the difficulty is small compared to the previous work, especially after the armor is broken, a bunch of soldiers can make the blood bars disappear instantly.In addition, although the game battle is cool and the scene is magnificent, it is still a bit tired after repeating the military, but the process is indeed not 6-7h.

③ At the same time, this time the game emphasizes multi -person online elements, which is good or bad.The benefits are naturally the addition of online elements can greatly increase the fun of the game and preservation period.However, the disadvantage is also very intuitive. Because the stand -alone battle of the game can also be designed directly according to the online, and the AI ​​of the game is very mentally handicapped, it is common to stuck.Red temperature is inevitable.The production team still lacks polishing these elements. For example, if there is a level, you need to adjust the four antennas. It must be covered by one person according to the other two of the organs. If many people are definitely not a matter, but if you play with a single machine, you need to press for a long time to press the old for a long time.AI, AI really watched the small soldier beating you without cover, and let you crazy about blood.There is also one type of task in the back, which can really vomit you blood.The game PVE action mode is simply a nightmare of the liver emperor. In fact, the design of this mode is very clever. The PVE level is the other side of the main line.He played, and he also felt like to play with Titus.However, the production team may want to lengthen the time of the game. This model is simply liver.The level of several arms of the game is separated by the level, up to 25 levels, and the upgrade skills point requires money. Unlocking various armor components requires 37 pairs each. Each weapon separates experience.Level is still separated.The action mode has a total of 6 levels. This requires you to play repeatedly hundreds of times, even if someone chats online, it can't stand it.The PVP experience is also very poor. You can only hold a group. There is no feeling of competition. Now there are even plug -in (Little Blue Bear, you really have to add bugs, what is useless?).In short, although the quality of the game is good, there are really many places that need to be updated.

There is no point in talking about the advantages, everyone has already seen everything according to the trailers that she looks amazing on all fronts and this is really so, but, several fronts managed to lose.
For those who are going to play the difficulties of the ""Death Angel"", it is not worth it, just because of the combat system.Constantly lacking first -aid kits and without deaths, even with all the dexterity, it will simply be impossible:

1. Due to the incredibly well-aimed enemies that are pixels through tiny pixels, some enemies will be spaced with very strong attacks, such attacks are not blocked in the rifts / evasion / retorting or you either accept fate, or have managed to hide.Of course, there are two cells of the armor, but they are demolished every second even after finishing up if you are in a heap of enemies who boil around and attack who.
One could still resolve the question if the finishing of special enemies added health, but it does not add and finishing special enemies gives exactly the same as the usual ordinary beetle - a cell of armor, which will be immediately played.
2. AI allies when playing without friends are simply unbearably dumb.They finish off the opponents when it is not necessary, when you yourself are running to finish, or do not finish off at all while you are busy with other enemies at the other end of the arena, he leaves the condition and continues to beat you.
They decide to raise you for half a year, even if their boots stand right on your head, they wait for the drum, wait and rest.They inflict damage and even help to kill, but 99% of the arena is cleaned precisely by the player, with due good luck they will help 5 percent more than usual.
It is clear that they don’t need to give them for the player, but help in such conditions could have provided, at least the first -aid kits would have been thrown out of nowhere during the very harsh conditions of the battle.
AI promise to correct in the nearest patch, but so far it is like this.

The difficulty could be excellent and sane, if not for these disadvantages that spoil the impression of passage.Not critical, but it would be comfortable playing on a veteran, if you want to not only crush, but the difficulty bites slightly.And there are no achievements for the angel of death, you can start on any comfortable.

Final bossfite.Refers only to the complexity of the ""Angel of Death"".
Well, this is some kind of nightmare.Firstly, it is very, very protracted and not without turning the boss into a regular sponge for damage.Secondly, due to the fact that the camera is not in the center of complexity with some attacks, and there is a lot of damage.So from some point, the boss begins to rush strictly in all directions and make noise, and the readability of attacks occurs in the color of the blow and the sound that it is about to be applied.",2024/9/20,ru

This game refers to many of the same type of games, including and is not limited to 40K dark tide of war hammers. They have the same remote unit design. After the maximum difficulty, two remote soldiers can be two shots and blood.One shot (the high enemy unit hurts the sky high)
Of course, you don't have to worry that all monsters in this game are plural, and you don't have to worry about whether you can't meet the strange situation.(There is a very abstract monster in the case of the value of the sky)
If you are curious, how do we have the ability to fight against such people, after all, we are Astart, so we can get up to 4 A4 paper shields to resist the monster's attack. The opponent is the most ordinary.The miscellaneous soldiers also need 4 times to break our defense, and even the most common long -range soldiers need 3 to spend 1 second to break your shield.The character's skills only need to reply to your shield in the next 2-3 seconds in the next 2-3 seconds of the monsters like a tide.Shield, of course, we can also use friendship and magic to quickly get a shield, but it is very good that the same unit can only have one person using friendship magic. There is often a human creature full of blood.Find the Blood Teammate's Life Monster to use friendship magic. Of course, you don't have to worry about it. Under normal circumstances, you will not match your teammates, but if you unfortunately use friendship magic to restore a little shield, you don't need to worry about it, you don't need to worry, you don't needThe mobs behind you will still use an unsatisfactory corner to use no prompt attacks to remove your A4 paper shield or pity (poor shield mechanism and poor physical fitness)
In order to allow players to experience all the game content, even if you say that you don't want to play high difficulty, you just want to experience simple grass, and you don't have to worry. Thanks to the weapon upgrade system, you have to challenge the highest difficulty.You feel the decision -making, you can only choose one upgrade in each column.

As captain Titus, legendary ultramarine, you plunge into the fight against endless hordes of tyranids, and the experience of every clash is monumental.The game offers dynamic fights that perfectly combine shooting and brutal close combat.The mechanics is smooth and satisfactory, each rinse with a chain sword or a volley of Bolter is accompanied by an incredible dose of adrenaline. The game looks amazing.The environment, destroyed battlefields and detailed figures perfectly capture the dark, Gothic atmosphere of the Warhammer 40K universe.The music is epic and adds to the grandiose of battles.Sound effects, such as the roar of tyranides or rumble Bolter, are like a balm for the ears of every fan of action games.

The story, although it is not the most demanding, fits perfectly to the frenetic pace of the game and offers several epic moments that will keep your memory in your memory.Whether you are a veteran of the world Warhammer 40k or a newcomer, the game will pull you out and let you go.

""Space Marine 2"" excels at all levels - from brutal fights to atmospheric rendition of the battlefield.It's a game you just have to experience.If you are looking for a clean, uncompromising action set in one of the most iconic science fiction worlds, ""Space Marine 2"" is a clear choice for you.

Haywire Hayley,0,17.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/haywirehayley/,"I really want to love this game but as someone who's hugely into the Tide games by Fatshark I just don't think I can. It fails to capture the fantasy of being a space marine, in my opinion, and has multiple fundamental issues with its combat system. I think the simplest way to summarise it would be to say that it feels like I'm controlling a cumbersome vehicle that barely responds to my commands as opposed to a superpowered human being.

Skill issue, you might say? Well, no, not really. In fact, one of my main problems is that the (incredibly arbitrary, incidentally) blue parry indicator appears TOO EARLY and if you respond to it extremely promptly then you instead fail the parry and are punished rather than appropriately rewarded. This can be adjusted to, of course, but it feels terribly unintuitive.

That leads me to how only SOME attacks have audio cues and others don't... Why? Darktide has an audio cue for every melee attack made against you, and it feels great. Sound design in general isn't great here, with boltguns almost sounding like suppressed rifles. The gun strike mechanic also feels wildly inconsistent, and there's the lovely fact that your teammates can inadvertently prevent you from pulling these off.

But whiner, why do you keep making comparisons to Darktide? Well, I'd argue Darktide is the best 40k shooter available right now and I don't see any reason to buy this one while it exists unless you truly hate always online components or are one of those (boring... sorry) people who is specifically obsessed with space marines.

PvE operations difficulty is MASSIVELY inflated compared to the Normal mode of the campaign which I picked in the hopes of having a fun power fantasy experience. For the most part, the campaign does an OKAY job of achieving this despite the aforementioned issues - and has some amazing setpieces - but the starting operations difficulty is a mess. You are woefully underpowered for whatever reason and are expected to grind to achieve the physical power necessary to actually feel like a badass as opposed to a worthless chump.

Something is wrong when I feel infinitely more like a space marine in Darktide as my pathetic little stim addict almost-heretic on even the highest difficulty. I've not even mentioned how painfully unbalanced the Thousand Sons are compared to the tyranids. Inconsistency seems to be the name of this game.

I'm entirely unimpressed by the weapon variety seen here. Bolters, bolters and more bolters. Most of the ranged weapons are simply bolter variants, with a few exceptions, and then there's a grand total of four melee weapons. Rather pitiful compared to what's on offer in Darktide.

So, what about PvP? It feels totally slapped on to me. Melee has way less of an impact than I'd expect in a *Warhammer* game, the TTK is stupidly fast for what are supposed to be impressively durable supersoldiers, and I've (I'm NOT exaggerating) not played a single match that wasn't absurdly one-sided.

To me it feels as if they created the 6 - 10 hour ish campaign and then realized that releasing a shooter exclusively comprised of that doesn't exactly fly in the 2024 market for the price of $60; so what did they do? They cooked up a half-arsed PvP mode and a co-op PvE experience with an obnoxious progression system in the hopes of artificially extending playtime and creating the illusion of value. There's only minor enemy placement differences on each replay and no semblance of an AI director so content runs dry quick.

Sounds familiar, actually. A lot like World War Z by the same studio.

That value just isn't there for me, personally. I would pay maybe $30 just to experience the campaign which is visually breathtaking and full of cool moments, both narratively, and from the perspective of sheer rule of cool. But everything else? it's just mid, I think.

Frankly, I don't understand why Darktide was so lambasted for its launch when this game suffers from the same issues of a lack of content, poor optimization and crappy weapons that take forever to tune and actually feel solid. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I really can't find the appeal.",2024/9/15,en

Irish,1,15,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028358390/,"Where do I even start. Not sure who started the rumour, but the campaign is not 6 hrs, f that. It's way longer. I've clocked 14hrs on normal difficulty and skipped half the side missions. I'd say 16-17hrs max on normal. This is an AWESOME game. Masculinity incarnate. Ticks all the boxes. Brotherhood, a calling for a higher purpose, good vs evil. This is a blokes game. It will tickle every masculine atom in your body. That's not to say females wont enjoy this game, you will, it just means you're an ultimate badass.

You don't have to be a lore expert here. I myself am a casual warhammer fan. I just know the basics. And you can too, there are many 1 hour videos on youtube that will read you the basics, and get you up to snuff. Watch one of those and your done.

But here's the gist.

Play as a 7ft tall superhuman soldier, a space marine, created by the Emperor himself. It's a grim dystopian future, humanity is in a constant galactic war for it's very survival. A galactic war that has no end. A war that has raged for tens of thousands of years. A war against Elves, Orcs, Machine races, Tyranids (think Alien xenomoprhs), And traitor humans and demons from the realm of chaos (basically a dimension that originally harboured souls of the dead, but became overwhelmed by constant war and death in the galaxy that it is now a twisted dimension of chaos and evil) a dimension that leaks into ours, twisting and corrupting everything it touches.

You don't have to play the first game, but I absolutely advise it. There a more than a few references to it. It's a great game. This series is gonna be huge. So don't starve yourself of any backstory.

As for the gameplay, I suggest playing on normal, any higher and you lose that power fantasy feel and becomes kind of a chore to play. The level design is incredible, better than anything today, seeing the armies of humanity fighting this endless war in the background is incredible, tanks and apc's rolling around, it's so much fun to just watch. You'll really feel like you're playing an important role in this war. It will feel like it's unfolding in front of you. And the downtime on the ship in between mission is just icing on the cake.

It's expensive. But we need to support devs that remember what gaming is about. Appealing to their audience. Not mass appeal and micro transactions.

So, grab you're weapon brother, and get into the fray.

Rostig,0,66.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999031456/,"I got to say, the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

After putting almost sixty hours into the game, most of that being grinding out xp on the only six limited PVE maps with friends. I could go and pick apart things in the story from the point of someone who knows the 40k universe, of even some story points that just don't make sense. You can find those on your own.
The story was satisfactory, far from perfect, the visuals are fantastic there are indeed moments of awe.. but by and large those appear to be smoke and mirrors.

Even with the souls like punishing combat systems... yes, you play a space marine and spend most of your time pretending to be a rolling pill bug. Hiding behind corners, but only right hand corners as you cannot shoulder swap, or going into melee to parry, parry, parry, dodge, parry.. unless you like getting stun locked or shot while almost to your feet during the standing animation. More to say there but pushing on to the point.

I'm bored with it. Completed the campaign, on vet. Had some fun. Did some grind stuff with the boys. Found out the combat systems in place feel bad. Again explore the reasons if you like there are tons of videos on both the good and the bad already out there.

Ended up going back to Helldivers, and Darktide. Good try Focus, this one should have stayed in the oven. I don't regret playing it, I do regret paying the pre-order price. Darktide holds more value, and much less of a price if we want to compare 40k to 40k games. Even if you rank it at 1 dollar per hour played, I didn't get my value.

Already, positive points:
-It's super beautiful, graphically it's impeccable and the artistic style fits perfectly with Warhammer 40K.
-The history, although sitting simple (as is often the case in Warhammer) flows fluidly and we let ourselves be caught.
-Super technical condition, in 4 hours of play I met only one bug: the IA colleagues who sparently grenades in the elevator, and still it did not last long.

I went around, yes it was short, now the angry things:
To put it simply: take ""Space Marine 1"", remove everything that made the game fun and you have ""Space Marine 2"".

-We go from 4 weapons equipped to only 2, which considerably reduces gameplay possibilities and poses a big problem on the management of ammunition (all the time short).
-The armor system supposed to protect your life bar does not work.Each armor bar takes only 1 stroke (and you only have 2), so since you're constantly facing 50 critters both that you can say that the armor will not be active very often.
-The system to recover from life is frankly darker: no more executions that allow you to regenerate your HP, now it makes 1 armor bar (see the previous point to understand why it does not work well), you can only recoverSome of the last damage suffered and only with hand and body ... making all the fight at a distance completely useless since you can only lose.
So, they put care objects well ... Finally I believe, they shine so much by their absence that I spent the first 3 hours of play asking me if they really existed.
-speaking of weapons from a distance: they are all pissed off.Without messing around, who replaced the bolter with a plastic nerve?!Even by emptying a whole charger (25 shots) right in the face of a single mob other than the small shit that crawl on the ground ... you don't kill it!Weapons do miserable damage and it completely breaks the ""Badass"" side that comes with playing a Space-Marine.I play a super-soldier of 3 meters fifty that makes the ground tremble when it walks ... and I fight with a weapon that pulls dry prunes, pay your anticlimatism> <
-The alterations of random effect that prevent you from playing, like the poison which makes blind or the effect of confusion which makes you lose control of your character, etc ...

Combines all this at the same time ... and you can just not play: between the random alterations that completely prohibit you from doing anything, half of the enemies that get your lifebar from a distance (life bar that youCan not regen given the almost permanent absence of care objects and the gameplay problems mentioned above) and the fact that you can not kill enemies for lack of damage and you have the perfect combo of the anti-game.
Space Marine 1 was a hack'n slash stuffed with testosterone or you had fun in the middle of an ork tide ...
Space Marine 2 is a punishment in which you desperately try to have fun in the face of a system designed to ruin you the pleasure of play.

Sold for 60 euros, I call it a scam.

Edit: in low difficulty mode, the game is super nice and I took a lot of fun ... But the story becomes very short, and the defects of game-design and balancing that I describedHere continue, even if they are much more discreet.

🟢 What I liked

✅ Cooperative.He probably makes this game in many ways.Without him, it would be much more boring.I played a coop with two friends.

✅ Crowds of enemies.Crowds of enemies are felt and look gorgeous.Not that in Serious Sam 4 with his legion system, which was seen once in the entire game.Here the crowds are straight seamless.Flying only stand out.And in the end, if you allow a crowd of enemies to you, there will be a really crowd of enemies around you.)

✅.Atmospheric decor.Pretty static.Of the interactions with him, there is only the destruction of the boxes, the activation of inflaments and dialogs with the background characters, but ... this time it worked.Perhaps, in conjunction with crowds of enemies and high -quality art - it worked and went straight to me.

✅.It is a little interest for me as a fight for me.There was a lot of firing much more pleasant.The close battle is not read very much.But then the animations are cool and the weight of the cosmodes is felt.So for the ""wig"" roles with friends in the coop is very tolerable.

✅.As I wrote above, this game has a very high -quality art.It is interesting to consider locations.Despite the fact that events seem to be localized not far from each other - the scenery is always different and there is a contrast between them.

✅.The game is quite good.The dialogs are plausible, in the spirit of Wahi 40k.All this is served with high -quality katsen, which are sometimes even interactive.

🔴

❌.Permanent discos with a servak ​​darmed.

❌.Enemies sometimes ignore shelters and throw through them in long battle.

❌.Sometimes the game for some reason takes me cool guns that I found in the campaign.And it gives out something stock, such as a conventional bolter.

❌.It was not enough for me very much.On high difficulty on arenas you often die or allies.And sooner or later, in one of the arenas, the number of revival will end.And you have to replay from the control point.As if between the arenas, after the battle, it is necessary to regenerate these rebirths.",2024/9/21,ru

With everything being launched in alpha, or beta stages, its beyond refreshing to have a game launch completed, and playable, with the devs having plans for the future.

If you like atmospheric games that can drag you into its setting. DO NOT hesitate on picking this up.

5ilverback_,0,11.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994388327/,"Im a huge Warhammer 40k fan.

I will post a deeper review but right now this is unplayable for me.
I have a monster pc. Visuals are great. But i keep getting disconnected every 15 min. I have a 500/500 mbit line, no issues with other games. I run my own servers on other games and people have zero issue connecting and staying connected etc.

I got the most expensive edition of the game. So far, story is OK.... visuals are great, custcenes are rly good, some animations are a little off, your shoulder gets dislocated every time you take a step. Voice acting is amazing top tier stuff huge thanks to the actors.

Gameplay tho is repetetive to death. You go to a area get and kill some mobs and u go to next area and kill some more mobs.
You run around a corner. The enemy literally stands stationary. Not even reacting to you untill you get close enough. It just feels so janky and doesnt ""flow"" at all. In those situations mobs dont feel ""alive"" at all. They are just waiting for me to kill them so i can go to the next area...

And its hella empty on content. Not enough missions for the pve. Not deep enough missions to keep the pve interesting. And to be honest customization is a little meh. How many years of dev and this is it? And then you bundle up some more customization stuff for dlcs and lock it behind some random named currency.. Come on, What do you think this is? Im gonna wait here like a little puppy for 3-4-5 months untill u give me one skin of each, one weapon, one armour skin, and some random faction that basically dont mean anything. And this is going to keep me hyped to play? gtfo i payed 99 bucks for this ♥♥♥♥ dude and i still disconnect constantly and it infuriates me because i have a hard time playing pve and pvp.

Weapons are like pee shooters. Melta guns/cannons doesnt melt ♥♥♥♥. Literally 2 meters from a bioform the heavy melta should incinerate that bio like nothing, but i put 3 shots in to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and he still running around like i tickled his chin. The bolter is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand rocket launcher and face shots do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They are getting miniature rocket powered artillery shells that are specifically design to pierce armour and blow up right in the face and they just keep walking. I understand its a game, but i dont feel ""Space Marine"" powerfull at all.,

If this is primaris space marine. It feels like a downgrade. You pop 2 shots off before the enemy is to close so you start to flail around like a spastic ape trying to put in some ""combos"". These combos are so slow that you manage to get swarmed so now you have to start rolling around like a moron and swinging randomly to get ads down before you can focus on the bigger guys that have been shooting at you from a distance.

Primaris marine? Everything hurts. One of these smallest creatures step on your toes you take damage.
These primaris marines take damage from the smallest las gun from a grunt. While on the internets you can clearly see space marines comfortably standing in front of a stationary las turret and eat that like the tank that he is. Not in Space Marine 2. I guess they made the primaris armour a little softer so it doesnt chafe as much in the crotch area....

Space marine 2 made me kinda understand why they turned to the chaos gods for more power......

Ive read alot of the lore. And the story depth that exists for 40k is almost immeasurable. Space Marine 2 story feels a little rushed. There is so much story they could have put in to this about the chaos marines for example. Where they come from. Their primarch etc or sooomething more.
When they showed up on screen it felt like. Here is your new enemy, he looks like you but he has a special hat and hes purple. And im chasing this mfker asking myselfe why the ♥♥♥♥ can he teleport?
And i cant let go of the tought if alot of it got left on the cutting floor.

My second heart hurts that i have to give this a negative review.
If the connection issues dont get solved and we dont get some amazing dlcs for rly cheap.
This season pass for 39 bucks is not ok either. 20 bucks difference from the full game? The season pass is not worth the 39 bucks. Not even close. I dont think its even worth 20 bucks.
A couple missions for pve and pvp maps and some small skins....39?

I know you are getting alot of praise right now by the normies impressed by the visuals and the ""fresh"" gameplay. And the people who are starstruck from the sheer weight of the 40k franchise. You might wiggle your finger at those people and have them easily impressed.

But im looking at you. And i see what you are doing. I take my hat off for a step at the right direction compared to some of these other devs. But i see what you are doing and i dont like being taken for a fool. These dlcs better be damn good.

Not impressed what so ever. Horrible launch for the price that I payed for at least. And i have been playing warhammer games since the 90s.",2024/9/22,en

JakeCook,1,155,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JakeCookSC/,"In the unfathomable and merciless darkness of the 41st millennium, only war and duty endure. For a veteran who has devoted over 25 years to the universe of Warhammer 40,000, it is not merely a pastime, but an existence dedicated to tales of courage and fury. Local Games Workshops are no longer just stores; they are sanctuaries of fervor where meticulously painted miniatures awaken under the hands of devoted artisans. Some, like my brother, have even achieved local fame, while masters such as Jérémie Bonamant shine on a national scale.

Witnessing the armies of the Astartes, the Tyranid hordes, and colossal war machines come to life in a video game reignites the latent passion of the old warrior I’ve become. It’s a triumphant return to the glory days, where every detail, from the smallest Imperial icon to the legendary Land Raiders, is recreated with breathtaking fidelity, capturing the very essence of what it means to be a servant of the Emperor.

The campaign is an epic of rare intensity, where neophytes and veterans alike unite in a brutal, merciless spectacle. It is a blood-soaked work, where steel and determination clash, a perfect outlet for those seeking to escape the monotony of their banal lives. Under the command of the iconic Sergeant Demetrian Titus, you embark on an unrelenting crusade against countless enemies, some of whom appear for the first time in a video game to face the wrath of the Imperium, all modeled with a meticulousness worthy of the Omnissiah.

The game’s PvE is praised for its demand, rewarding those who master the art of combat and forge their Space Marine with care, without ever drowning in sterile complexity. The gameplay, as fluid as a bolter spewing death, transcends the heaviness of the armored hero. Every step of this warrior, weighing like a Rhino, is felt in the heat of battle. As for PvP, while it offers epic clashes, it still lacks that brutal essence that permeates the universe of the 41st millennium.

In conclusion, this opus is a divine offering to those who seek an intense escape into fury and glory. But be warned, the path is fraught with challenges, the difficulty is high, and learning the patterns is essential if you do not wish to be torn apart by a Tyranid. Find yourself battle-brothers, for only heroes united under the Emperor's banner survive the storms of fate. It is a masterpiece for the initiated, a final war cry that will pin you to your throne.

The blessings of the Omnissiah:
• Imperial visuals: The graphics, in 4K Ultra, are grand frescoes capturing the majesty of the Imperium’s cruisers in the cold void of space.
• Heroic crusade: Every mission is an epic battle where heroes are covered in glory and receive the highest honors.
• Tactical maneuvers: The gameplay, as sharp as the skirmishes of the Space Marines, challenges Xenos and heretics with a consuming rage.
• Homage to the ancestors: A saturated ode of references, as faithful as the archives of the Mechanicum, preserving the very essence of the original game.

But the work is not finished:
• PvP too limited: Clashes between Space Marines must capture more of the brutality of the 41st millennium.
• Endgame content: The Mechanicum must forge more missions and quests to extend the heroes’ epic journey.
• Bestiary too limited: The battlefields thirst for new enemies, whether it be rampaging Orks, Necrons, or the cunning T’au.
• Warp instabilities: The Tech-priests must resolve the server disruptions to ensure a stable experience.
• Uneven difficulty: Some enemies, like the Neurothrope, seem beyond the reach of mere mortals.
• Capricious parries: Squads must perfect their mastery of close combat to ensure effective responses to enemies.
• Resilience of the Primaris: The Apothecarion must enhance protocols to ensure the Primaris reflect their legendary invincibility against the hordes.

The Forges of Mars are already active, preparing future improvements. For the path to glory never ends in the unforgiving universe of the 41st millennium. For the Emperor and for humanity, this game aspires to ascend among legends.

PS: As a devoted servant of the Imperium, I can attest that my war machine, forged in the most powerful industrial worlds, knows no failure or weakness. No crashes, no framerate drops trouble the blessed functioning of this technological relic. My cogitator runs with immeasurable power, so much so that even in 4K Ultra, it barely awakens, effortlessly maintaining 60 FPS (capped), like an Astartes meditating before battle. However, I understand that some may face the dark forces of optimization with configurations less blessed by the Omnissiah. May the Machine Spirit aid them!",2024/9/21,en

Originally I left a negative review on this game after I started a new campaign on Veteran. ""I just did my fourth play-through of Space Marine 1!,"" I thought, ""I'm basically a Veteran already!"" Oh how wrong I was. I got frustrated that I kept dying, and blamed the game for it. It wasn't until I put more hours in that I finally caught my stride, and I can play Veteran comfortably. For your first campaign run, I suggest playing on Normal.

Space Marine 2 continues the tale of badassness of Demetrian Titus, and I feel it definitely does him justice. The campaign is short, sweet, and bombastic as all Hell and jumps the shark (positive) in the final two missions. The writing is solid, the gameplay loop hard but fun.

The biggest change from SM1 to SM2 is the melee combat. The chainsword retains the exact same combo from the first game, which is a welcome change, but the combat system surrounding it is different. Executions no longer directly repair Health, but instead give you one pip of armor, and contested Health.

So your total health pool has non-regenerating Health and regenerating Armor. In SM1 it worked much like Halo, where the armor was a separate bar that regens after a small amount of time. In SM2, the armor is divided into 'pips', each one a set amount of HP. Before the Sept. 29, 2024 patch, each chaff enemy would hit you for one pip of armor. So if you are hit twice, you are now bleeding non-recoverable health damage. Now, they just do damage as if you are hit by anything else.

Executions now regenerate armor, usually 1-2 pips depending on difficulty. You can also regenerate armor via parrying. Yes, there's now parrying and parry windows in this game, marked by a big blue indicator. Red indicators, you must dodge, with an i-frame dodge. And one top of that, if you recently took Health damage, you can deal damage back to regen contested health. Oh, and if you stun enemies, you can also do a gunstrike that deletes chaff and staggers bigger targets with a 1-pip armor regen and no i-frames.

This is like a weird mix of Bloodborne and SM1, and requires a bit of practice and old-habit deletion to get down, but once you're in the flow, it's a wonderful time. The power fantasy has shifted from 'I can just walk all over Orkz with ease' to 'I can dodge, shoot, duck, weave, and destroy 'nids with skill.' It's fun!

Edit: there's been 3 updates to the game since my review, and all they did was Nerf everything people found viable or fun. Awesome don't even bother it just shows how lazy and incompetent these developers are, the little hope I had for this game is gone along with 80+% of the players a month after release.
Original Review:
I hate to leave a negative review as the game has some good qualities to it and I was excited for it, but I'm a little disappointed, it's not as perfect as people make it out to be. A lot of the issues seemed to be overlooked or not talked about. I can only hope they make changes and that it improves, as there's a lot of potential and I want it to be better.
Everything I talk about will be for PVE since I don't care for PVP. I played 2 matches and it felt like destiny 2 which sucks ballsack.
I don't really know where to begin I guess positives-
The campaign felt and played good and the customisation is good and the overall setting, atmosphere, and presentation and the monetization.
now everything else-
Most of the classes in operations, except for 1 or 2 out of the 6 feel underwhelming and unbalanced, and don’t feel like you are playing as a Space Marine. One of the two exceptions I mentioned is the Heavy class he feels great to play from the start, the other I've heard gets better is Tactical. The only reason I haven't played him is that there's no reason to when heavy can do everything and you shouldn't need to spend 10 to 15 hours maxing out a class just for it to feel as fun or competent as Heavy. the other classes need to be buffed to feel more on par with Heavy rather than Heavy getting nerfed. The other classes just don't compare and feel weak which Space Marines shouldn't.
A lot of the weapons and class perks are lackluster/superficial and give the illusion of choice, most classes are pigeonholed into specific weapons and perks and only have 1 viable primary. All classes with access to pistols and melee should have the ability to use all pistols and the knife/chainsword. Not that melee matters or is worthwhile at higher difficulties It's just not fun, Heavy doesn't use melee and is easily the most enjoyable I'm not even going to talk about how useless/restricted Assault is. Maybe bringing back health gain from executions like in the first game could improve gameplay. As for the perks you are always going to pick the ones that give you more ammo and health due to how scarce it is in higher difficulties which you need to play if you want to progress / have more fun. So there's no meaningful choices / variety or builds to be made
Speaking of difficulties, they feel arbitrary and poorly designed. As you go higher you get fewer heals, heal for less, less ammo, fewer grenades. Enemies become tankier bullet sponges and they deal more damage. It's not challenging it's just frustrating not being able to do anything. Difficulties shouldn't feel like a poverty slider that makes you weaker instead there should be more and bigger enemies and maybe deal more damage and tighten parry windows. Most of the missions are monotonous and time-consuming, so overall the replayability is very limited when there's only a couple viable weapons and classes there's no reason to use the others.
All of that is ignoring the server issues desyncing and causing other players to fly, the enemies shooting through walls and matchmaking problems, the AI being terrible and bugging out, progress being lost/reset which should be fixed in time. Some small things like the UI why is there no option to delete created armour and colour presets?, Why are settings being reset or not saved? It feels like my audio settings and motion blur are being reset every time I launch, and there should be options to disable some of the annoying visual effects like vignette and change FOV instead of resulting to mods.
Anyway it's not an awful game but I don't think it's worth $60-$100 maybe wait for it to drop a third in price or until they fix or rebalance everything and add whatever content they have planned as currently its lacking content and any replayability. I just hope the people excessively praising the game and ignoring issues realize that they are doing more harm than good. The classes, melee, difficulty levels, operations and rewards need rebalancing",2024/9/18,en

Make a corridor action for 8 hours without this imaginary freedom of choice, an open and empty world or with a bunch of soul -piercing stories about each of the characters with their skeletons in the closet.
Pff.Waha is not about that.Waha has never been about all these snot.But about what Waha is shows SpaceMarine.She is about scale, pathos, overcoming and marginal cruelty in everything and to everything.
So, we have the most ordinary action from a third person.Simple, like three kopecks in terms of concept.You are the lieutenant of the cosmic paratroopers Titus and your task is to stop the investment of hostile alien beetles (well, for example) - tyranids.At your disposal - bolts of various types and sizes - automatic, sniper, and Marxman and many others.At your disposal of a chain or power sword, and maybe a hammer that can be smartly smashed by whole waves of adversaries and naturally turn them into minced meat.At your disposal, there are several types of grenades, with the help of which you can bring the light of the emperor to the most inaccessible places of enemy mass accumulations.
The fighting, at the same time, departs from the usual approach of such games, where nearby weapons are used as a last resort or for stealth.Your sword is a full -fledged type of weapons that will have to be wielded to the same extent at which you will shoot.For a variety, they added the opportunity to block and fend off attacks, which in itself is not the simplest task when you are literally anti -senior tiranids.With a successful courage, you can not only send the enemy to the knockout, but also restore part of the armor so that you can continue to fight, drive the enemies of the emperor into the ground, tear them into pieces with bare hands ... ahem ... in general, you don’t have to get bored.Enemies are just a wild amount and there is no time to yawn.The whole game takes place at a frantic pace with wild dynamics in skirmishes and there is practically no time to take a break.
But when it appears, it immediately becomes possible to admire local species.The words “gigantism” and “scale” come to mind, in fact, two more distinguishing features of the Vaha universe.The views here sometimes just amaze and always wants to stand and look for these fiery halls, churches, crypts and other structures longer.At the same time, all this is not static-something constantly flies by, someone screams, someone fights fiercely with someone.The impression of a full -scale military theater is created and it is extremely interesting to watch it.Artists and designers obviously tried to fame.
Well, we stood, examined, return to the batch and this time we pay attention to how it sounds.And it sounds juicy and delicious.The heavy steps of the paratroopers, the shots of bolter and lasganov, the cries of soldiers, the screams of tyranids - everything is voiced simply gorgeous and perfectly complements the picture of hostilities.Unfortunately, I can’t say the same thing about music simply because against the backdrop of all these atmospheric screams and explosions from music to the ears, only the sounds of backbills are heard without clear melodies, which is not bad - an ideal background for what is happening.
And finally - partners.Immediately make a reservation - the illegitar bots are stupid, like Magnus.It is extremely recommended, especially in high complexity, to get a couple of friends and then the spectacular and colorful crumb of xenos will be provided.You directly begin to feel the mutual support and shoulder of a friend in sometimes difficult battles and fights with bosses.Well, in a separate regime of pvo operations without living people and it makes no sense to meddle.These operations, by the way, do not hang apart, but pass parallel to the main campaign and complement it, and sometimes there are more interestingly what Tit is doing at the moment.There is also a PVP mode, but personally, I have never been a lover of this in the essentially games, and the match was never found once, but I will not say that I regretted it.
In conclusion, I would like to note that I have not seen so impregnated with the spirit of the forty -thousandth game for a long time.Now, if someone asks how to join this gloomy and cruel universe, the answer will be ready.There is no better spacmarin for the average gamer to date.

Why don't I recommend it then?
The campaign is not exceptional and is quite short, a bit of a shame for a game that is above all solo, say ... 9 am the countryside is finished.

How to justify the price then?
Well, the multiplayer that is ... passable ...
The PVE mode which is actually the most original thing has only 6 different missions which is really a shame.
The progression system is correct but a little too long for my taste.
No possibility of creating a private part and above all, you will leave games, there are 6 classes and no duplicates.
Basically you will pray that nobody already has pick the class you want.
It's already really boring, but the matchmaking had to be simply nonexistent, there is justn't one.
You will often join a game that has already started without the possibility of choosing it or not, and in addition you will often be kick for x or y raion, in short it is frustrating.

The gameplay itself now.
A classic TPS, in reality quite disappointing for a Wh40K game, the feeling of weapons is not there, there are a total of fifteen weapons I would say, but in reality only a few are viable, we will pass the miles and one variantunnecessary bolter.
The bolter elsewhere, let's talk about it, he just does not do any damage, forced to empty a charger of 45 strokes to kill a basic monster, with a total of only 5 chargers ...
You see the problem coming, we find ourselves almost all the time short of ammunition, which greatly breaks the fun.
The body to hand now, on my side, I will say that it passes but it is far from fun to play, unlike sm1 here no regen of life and impossible to cancel in blow, in short, you will only playWith 90% of the time parades because CàC is just not a viable option since the mobs explode you at CàC.
The capacities of the classes which are but then not fun at all outside the standard, and the talent tree which is not really one, it is just passive which unlocks as you goBut which changes absolutely nothing at the gameplay.
In style, your main weapon inflicts 10% additional damage ... Far but then very far from class customization as in the Darktide which is however quite simple.
We are far from what a deep rock can offer with the overclocks that are ultra fun.

Special negative mention for waves of enemies, I explain myself, in each mission we have a phase where we must defend a place against waves of enemies, except that, unlike a World War Z where it is satisfactory becauseThe zombies arrive in a few paths, here the monsters come absolutely everywhere, we are almost instantly at CàC, there is no defense line and it is ultra frustrating.

In summary, SP2 is a good game, but far from satisfactory, I do not feel the fun that a Darktide can provide for a game that is a swarm shooter.Very quickly repetitive and accumulated with a fairly flat gameplay we quickly get pissed off.
I obviously only cited the negative points for me, although there were things that I appreciated in style animation or personalization in terms of appearance, it is clearly not enough for goodNoted the game.",2024/9/18,fr

ObDivanKenobi,1,36.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/obdivan/,"As Rogue Trader, this is the best RPG by Warhammer, so Space Marine 2 is the best action by Varhammer.The atmosphere, production and art are simply gorgeous, all this is done with maximum love for the original source and from the first minutes immerses in the atmosphere of the world of eternal war.
Play strictly with friends in a cooperative, or in a low complexity - and the Bolovniks are precisely that the blanks are only suitable to raise you if you fell, and you will be very often in the solo, because there will always be a lot of enemies, and they are painful.

Gameplain is all exactly - the guns shoot, the weapon of near -battle beats, the enemies are beautifully scattered into spare parts - but nothing more.This is a purebred old -school shooter even without pumping.

The main drawback of the campaign - it is criminally short, for 10 hours. Apparently in Saber they studied complaints about the monotony of the first part and solved the problem radically, the campaign is so short that the monotony simply does not have time to manifest itself and get bored.

The PVE missions (separate from the campaign) are beautiful, pass on separate specially collected maps and will not yield to the campaign in the production.Plus, pumping appears in PVE.There are exactly two shortcomings: on high difficulties with random Sopartians (or even more bots) there is absolutely nothing to do, and there are also few of them, only 6 pieces.

PVP ... it is, it is command dependent because of the high TTK and it is ill with non-core problems (high ping, Desing).Behind the lack of alternatives, it will fit and can even be funny, but because of the command dependence and lack of rebalance, you can easily get into the cycle of endless defeats.

------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, the game, despite the fact that short, leaves much more emotions than the faceless open worlds for 100+ hours, and definitely costs its money, especially in a cooperative.

hampstr,0,5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hamataro/,"Product received for free

Early negative review: seems like if Gear of War if it didn't have a shred of humanity, and looked really good. It's middling in a lot of ways, and the one way it is exceptional is that it is like Zoolander: really really really ridiculously good looking.

Graphically demanding, and while it runs fairly well, it has an upscaling menu that bears some dire implications for the future of graphics (AI upscaling presented as balanced option, native resolution presented as ultra-premium quality option).

Overheats your PC for fairly basic gameplay. Guns are good, slightly underwhelming, melee is a very lightweight system with a dash of Arkham and not particularly deep. Could be that it gets better, but I'm not in any hurry to find out. Once again, it feels like Gears of War but with the armor system replacing the cover system. Not in love with the tone, it's very self-serious and dire and slow, and you run into a lot of characters that are just so flat and one dimensional. Not much popcorn appeal there, but it's also hard to take with any gravitas since the game is just about big silly action figures ripping apart lizards.

It also lacks the mortality and urgency of Gears characters, since space marines are basically invincible superheroes in their universe walking past expendable nameless IG that they'd be willing to sacrifice without a second's hesitation. Grim, serious (verging on joyless) invincibility fantasy is just an odd wavelength to try and play along with in a basic TPS.

XMarkos,1,42.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/markuno/,"Pros:

1) A very beautiful visual, you can look at everything for a long time and break the F12 key.
2) Colorful finishing and for each weapon they are their own.
3) The crowds of tyranide are stupidly fun.
4) The characters in the company are registered quite interestingly for super -war in armor, who know only the war.
5) compared with the first part, both shooting and the nearby are strongly pumped.To shoot and beat very colorful, the difference, in fact, is also felt between the dacks and between the little girl well.Power sword - One Love.
6) Coopeous missions are directly related to the plot, so you understand that everything on the title did not agree and not only can be relying on it.
7) The plot can be held in a coop.

Cons:

1) The game is quite short, you will not come in it for a long time
2) there is no finishing from the back, as well as, let's say, from above.
3) with the introduction of chaosites, the crowds disappear, which is sad, they are generally sadder than tyranes
4) From the game classes - only a different set of spacmarins, nor apothecies.You won’t meet a librarian here (there are no problems for me, because it was a point in showing that “just marinchiks” were not the same)
5) only six coop missions that quickly bother.
6) There are simply no cosmetics on chaosites, but there are chaosites.

Adds:

1) In the game of critical bugs, I did not see, occasionally there are drops of servers, but as if yesterday it is not even the game is to blame, and Steam dropped.
2) I ran to the multiplayer a little, but you can catch my buzz in it.By itself, it seems to be quite distinctive and balance.
3) There are trunk abilities in the coop that make some (almost all) classes too strong, for example, endless ammunition on heavy weapons.I hope they will be recorded soon.
4) As a visual, there are open elements of the armor, each class has its own final look, in general, it has come to me, but you don’t really go for a lot, yet the code is important.For example, from the bastion (with a shield he runs and a police, as a rule, a sword) here is almost all of the armor with a cassock.This has dark angels in Back, the black templars and the honorary guards of Ultramar.All colors can be taken in the game.Generally.You can paint it in any color, but you either have almost standard armor, or with a bummer.It's just that at least a beautiful armor is stupid without a cash.About the same thing has a sniper, he has the majority of the armor with the winding of the Legion emblem, and as a result, the Maskhalat is completely.Really beautiful and in all details, the armor has heavy support, but the meaning is clear.

Bottom line:

I would be afraid to give advice “buy right right now!”, But, if there is an idea to buy, then you won’t spend money in vain, the game itself is good, just far from perfect.",2024/9/18,ru

ChronicNerditis,1,40.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066256617/,"Simply put: This game is extraordinary. Not only is it visually stunning and highly immersive, it is a game made for the target audience through and through. Loved every minute and can't wait for more after 9 hrs of play.

The story is rich, the characters are well done, and the atmosphere is palpable throughout the campaign. More than anything else though: Space Marine 2 is a game that makes me feel like I was heard. The game stays true to the core of 40k and incorporates much of the existing lore into an amazing rendition of that world.

The combat system takes some getting used to but it is akin to Helldivers and Gears of War blended with a somewhat ""Souls-like"" play style. Dodging, timed strikes and blocks, run gunning, and simply brute force are all options. Different combat strategies are rewarded differently with different enemy types and I enjoyed the challenge. On Veteran difficulty you absolutely have to be more careful and consider what enemies you are fighting our else you will get absolutely mogged. The combat is addictive and exactly what I think of when I read a 40k book. The flashlights are also fairly lore accurate which is awesome haha.

I highly recommend this game:

Pros:
-Fantastic landscape and world design. Highly rich environments with stunning visuals and details
-Plays fantastic. The combat system works great with minimal bugs and the game appropriately rewards strategy
-True to the lore and ties in nicely with the original game
-Very palpable passion in the writing and development. This game was made for true 40k fans and new fans alike. It leaves you excited to play again.
-Great PvP and PvE coop options

Cons:
-Audio bugs for me have been most common. Muffled audio randomly after cutscenes or death is my most frequent bug but even then are not persistent and resolved with rebooting the game.
-I wish the campaign was a smidge longer. I got a solid 8hrs out of my first playthrough on veteran, and I stopped to look at things and explore the NPCs conversations as I went. This is somewhat made-up for in the coop mission mode.
-Some of the enemies are serious bullet sponges and when playing solo campaign the enemies tend to target you far more than your NPC allies. Normally this would be ok, but when cooping the enemies target everybody in a more balanced way and that did make the missions more enjoyable simply because the mobs don't drown you in harass on top of tougher enemies.

There are also some obvious areas where the game can be expanded, and I really look forward to it.

I have not yet played the PvP heavily but in the brief time I did try it I enjoyed it.

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you are a 40k fan this game is worth every penny of full price. If you are a Helldivers/Gears of War/Halo fan you will probably love it too, and this game makes a decent into to 40k but you will have to google some things (Such as Space Marine structuring and who the Emperor is, but don't worry YouTube is rich in lore vids).",2024/9/15,en

ICShields,0,24.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023836949/,"Overall i have to say that in general it is a good game. It does a lot of things right. At least the launch wasn't scuffed like darktide's launch was. Plus i don't have to fiddle around with graphic settings to make it not run like the biggest laggy ♥♥♥♥♥ of a game i have ever seen.

Yet....there just no real substance to the game. I'm completely honest here, for a game like this. I am totally fine with the story being short (roughly 12 hours on veteran) all good.

BUT the big thing why i can't recommend is that the PvE is just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lackluster. 6 missions ? That's just not enough at this point. To really have a good rotation you need at least 10 missions. Then the fact that some classes are heavily limited to weapons.

The idea of their difficulty scaling is literally making enemies bullet sponges.
Thats just not good enough and only ruins the game when even the useful weapons aren't enough to pose a real threat to the enemy.

I don't play PvP so i can not comment on how this aspect is.

They also have a road map that should feature a horde mode. I mean....a horde of bullet sponges ? nah bruh. Its a good idea but with the current way the difficulty scales its just not something i could see people enjoying a lot. I'd rather have 4 new operations to freshen up things plus a rework of how difficulty scales.
Mix in more majoris or make random hordes appear at some point. But don't give them more health.

Also PLEASE for the love of anything that is holy and under the protection of the emperor, the one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing he doesn't protect is your server connectivity.

Campaign: Well paced plot is easy to digest and has a solid ending. Final boss fight is awesome with lots cool moment throughout.
Operations PVE: Lots to grind for and feels fairly challenging for progression; was hoping their be more than 6 ops, but they have promised more for free with each season.
Eternal War PVP: This mode unfortunately feel like it got done last minute. The game modes there are fine, but there's only 3 maps with spawns being terribly setup and classes definitely having balancing issues. More maps and mode have been promised, but balancing will come with time.
Customisation: There is tons to unlock for each class with plenty of colours and emblems to make whatever marine you can think of. That's at least for the loyalist astrates. The traitor astrates however suffer from same thing as pvp part of the game, probably cause they were done last minute as well. The armour is locked to a set class with only colours and emblem being changeable.

リカン,0,188.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198871762460/,"It's time to write a review. The main problems of this game:
1) Connection - constant connection errors in the ""eternal war"" mode, in particular problem 140, when you have to re-enter the game several times before all the stars align in the sky and you are allowed into the match, instead of being offered to go to the main menu once again . After which, by the way, nothing will change, you will still have to restart the game, and so on several times.
2) Chaos marine customization. We have a fairly rich customization for Loyalists and such a poor one for Chaos marine. Why are Chaos marine each class tied to a specific legion??? Why are there so few armor parts for them??? There are no my favorite ""thousand sons"" (Although they were in the main campaign of the game. Is it so difficult to integrate ready-made skins into pvp mode???). In general, Chaos marines are represented by a small number of legions, but where are the individual warbands, which are so numerous in the Warhammer 40k universe??? Here's another thing: Have you ever seen Berserker Khorne without a chain axe??? - and here you will see.
3) Class system. I will not say that some classes are completely unplayable, or become more or less playable only after opening some items. I have a completely different question here: Why does a game like ""Total Tournament"" or ""Quake Arena"" have a class system at all??? And the classes themselves do not inspire confidence: if the ""Night Lords"" still look in place, then Khorne berserkers in the form of a non-assault class are nonsense. Let me remind you that Saber ""presses so much on lore in its communications with the community"", for example, they have already answered the question: ""why is each legion of chaos tied to a specific class?"" - because it is according to the lore, and right then we see the berserker Khorne, who is clearly out of place. If you follow the class system, you will simply have to enter 100,500 thousand classes for each type of space marines, and then you will have to make 100,500 patches to balance this whole thing. I think it's easier to introduce a system of factions (legions), for example, you choose a legion to which specific types of space marines are available, and that's it. By the way, does anyone know why class experience in pvp mode??? (so I have classes that are developed to level 5, but how do they differ from the same class of level 1???)
4) I think it is no longer a secret for anyone that in the future it is a game service. Please remind me of the fate of most such ""new generation"" games))) I understand that all developers want to put their games on the ""monetization rails"" as soon as possible. I think at the stage of loot boxes with a small chance of dropping rare items, it will be possible to put the game on the ""Steam shelf"" and never come back here. I pre-ordered the max edition because I believed in this game, but if at some point I'm offered to buy skins and loot boxes in a AAA-game that's actually being sold instead of being offered for free, that would be a ""slap in the face"".

P.S I am giving a negative rating just to draw attention to the problems. The game is actually pretty good and has a lot of potential.",2024/9/20,en

I'm to simple man, I came to kill bugs and fuaa, it's incredible how it is enjoyed at all times.It is funny and frantic, and mission after mission the epicity amounts to peak that are the last hours.A jewel.

I still have the PVE and PVP modes (I don't feel like the latter, more out of curiosity), but I ended up completely satisfied with that campaign.

UPDATE: After more than 50 hours, I got fully into the operations and eternal warfares.The PVE is a delight, there are seven missions (to date) that have a lot of rejugability and they had a lot of fun in the highest difficulties, and even more so if one varies between the classes to try different game styles.The PVP on the other hand is OK to play a couple of games and now, I wanted the fact that it takes a long time to find games and, when it does, it almost always sends me to USA servers giving me high latency xD

Some weapons were not embarrassed by parameters (power fist), for some reason they took the opportunity, especially it was important for the devastators, to go into evasion during the “included” sight, you cannot start finishing in the sight of the sight, it is absolutely not clear why they spoiled the attack aircraft, who needs it.These kuldowns and freezing to think with the fall point in eternity.Absolutely disgusting cute fighting, it seems that we can spoke the attack, but this does not give anything, the enemy continues a series of attacks, it is easiest to dodge any attack if it is a small enemy that can be canceled with this, panicers from a pistol are rare, except for the framesInvulnerability, they do not carry.The attacks of the enemy do not interrupt the attack, we can only be introduced to the enemy into the light stegger.In the first part, the bolters carried impact due to the abundance of ordinary opponents, who quickly and picturesquely died under the flashes of the detonations of mass-reactive shells, here the usual Horoga-Correne or thermal Education can be paused several hits, deaths are lost in the crowd.5 varieties of ordinary bolts were lost in impact.

The dumped, patented horde technology has the same problem in the director's approach as the World War Z, we have an integral event, we are not the main part and the part is not the main one, we are dangling somewhere on the side.It seems that we are shown a giant horde, a general battle, tanks go into battle, the infantry is lining up in orders from dioramas, Astra Militarum supports the platoon of the 2nd company of ultra -harsh, but it simply leads us to the pocket of more local events, the general battle addresses the players only in the playersIn one mission of special operations (PVE of missions).It seems that we will even find ourselves in a general event, but we immediately leads us to another pocket and we go to beat three cripples, instead of a large -scale vagrakalov’s face.

Pow content with 6 short missions, for some reason there is no survival in a separate mission.
PVP Classic Trileine on small teams, I did not even go into other modes.
The pumping suddenly turned out to be divided, which differs from the first part and does not contribute to enthusiasm.

In general, the delight and positive emotions from the plot and pve received, the money was repulsed by 11/10, but with such a gameplay, linger longer than I could play, it will not work, a little sorry.

TheGoldenWallcreeper,1,21.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037181089/,"We have some kind of Warhammer holiday occurred with the release of this game.Personally, I liked everything about it:

- Very beautiful graphics with good optimization, despite everything that happens on the screen.The guys promised a huge number of models that simultaneously act on the screen in order to display the scale of the swarm of tyranids - and they did it.
Plus, the developers with great respect for the Laura showed beautiful, large -scale locations in the form of a combat barge, imperial cities - something like this you imagine when you read books on Vahe.
The first game in which I wanted to use photoregram (and I did it).
And how the armor of the space marines are drawn here - this is a separate high.It can be seen that this is really the armor of the warriors fighting centuries, all in scars, potholes and other marks of complex battles.This is amazing.

- Music.Everything is very good with her.

- Gameplay.I am glad that I chose not the maximum difficulty, because even on the penultimate ass, it was torn off so that some parts of the missions had to play 5 times until you pick up the key (or you simply do not post the CP).Although the final boss was given from the first tray.
In general, a good shooter / slasher, with understandable shooting, with a good impact and a variety of weapons, each of which is played differently, which cannot but rejoice.

In general, my soul, devoted to Varhammer, pleased as much as possible.From the plot, from symbols (separate and large like for them), I caught an orgasm several times, especially at the end.The last time such emotions were only in the third metro.

But the rest ... The obligation to redo the campaign when it has already been done in coop with colleagues, I do not see the principle.No history of the checkpoints of the different parts (countryside) that we were able to do.

The Space Marine bots are useless apart from revive with 2000pts of HP #Gadrielpower.The campaign is linear a shame when we see what other Helldiver studios do, Fallout ... The universe allows, it looks like the recipe for Space Marine 1 which we just revised the copy.

Not to mention the multi with ""exploded"" matchmaking.Who you put 3 levels 20 in front of 3 levels 9 ... because yes it was not easy enough to make the Rank apply to our whole unit?And whether the experience of the game or rather the story is more interesting.

> The assault: 3 blows of energy hammer to kill a scout ...
> The sniper scout: 3 balls to kill a guy ...
> Devastator: Incredible
> The tactic is well balanced astonishment

And to finish the IU in the game ... As much the design is top but you make a coop game without making a clean in-game social menu, we are struggling to invite friends to play is laughable.Call me to make a real ux it's my taff.

Frankly the W40K universe has so much potential, you are using barely 10% and again in a logic of play 10 years ago (PVP, Match, Campaign).It is sad for my taste, why not take up the recipe of Helldiver by going further with the races of W40K, invasion, planetary countryside see galactics etc ... with a choice of ""races"" of W40k that could be embodieddepending on the wishes of each.",2024/9/19,fr

Leonell,1,57.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120082889/,"As an aspiring fan WH40K, I am very happy with this game.
Pros:
+ Campaign, short but full -bodied and very addictive.Interestingly written characters and many moments in which they were breathtaking.
+ Gunplay for a very big plus.We feel every shot we give, we feel every hit in the enemy.The fight with white weapons is also very satisfying.Finnishers are a fairy tale and they never get bored.
+ The audio-visual setting is amazing.The amount of details on armor, buildings is huge.Also sharpening all this is refined to perfection.
+ Optimization, playing on RTX 3070 and I9 12 GEN, in no way I experienced FPS declines.For me plus, but I don't know how it is on other players' equipment.
+ Diversity of weapons.The arsenal is really substantial and you can match the class that interests us and weapons.There will be something for everyone.
Cons:
- Few of these PVE operations.I know that they are directly connected to the story, but unfortunately, there are too few of them.
- Gierek is rather to play for 1h, max 2h and then you have to take a break, because its repeatability is very high.Even changing the class to another does not help much.However, in my case there is a great desire to return to playing after these 2 hours.
- There is no distinction between the history of the Order that let us call it that.My friend noticed me and it actually started to disturb it a bit.By coloring the black Templar or a cosmic wolf, we still get dialogue issues of ultramariners.Unfortunately, this is a minus related to the fact that operations approach the story.I hope that this will change in future seasons.

And that's it on my part.

The campaign, while short, is a breath of fresh air when it comes to story-lines. The voice acting is perfect. It has one of the best representations of the WH40K world and most importantly, the Space Marines and the Imperium of Man. The storyline is simple but executed perfectly. The characters are simple as well, stoic, stalwart Marines who will risk death for their fellow brothers and their mission, and that's ok.

The devs and Saber should be proud of SM2. It's a return to classic gaming and what makes gaming fun. There's no hidden agendas, narratives or overt political messages shoved down our throats. There's no overly complicated characters with a plethora of problems pouring their hearts out and whining incessantly about how the world is against them. It's a simple storyline about brotherhood, duty, loyalty and just your basic good vs. evil. So refreshing.

Buy it. It's worth it. The campaign is gloriously fun and gets your blood pumping with the amazing cinematics. The multiplayer is addictive and isn't overly grindy. You truly feel more powerful as you level up. I look forward to new missions, enemies and PvP modes.",2024/9/18,en

Here are the ingredients you will need!

Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.

Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.

Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.


1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.

2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.

4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.

5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.

6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.

7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.

8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.

9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.

10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.",2024/9/18,en
