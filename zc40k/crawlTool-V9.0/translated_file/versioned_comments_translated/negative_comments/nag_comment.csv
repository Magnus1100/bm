This game cannot keep a blocking posture. Each time you block it, you must counterattack, and you can only counterattack a monster.If you play the dark tide, if you push it, will you play with a zombie?

Remote strange damage is outrageous, and blood volume is higher than melee.

Version_1,2024/9/10,0,"I'm sure this is a great game, but it's literally unplayable for me right now. My computer is well within the game's required specs, but within less than an hour, I had consistent issues with:

- Texture streaming. Textures sometimes simply wouldn't load, leaving the game a fuzzy mess
- Audio steaming. Music tracks stuttered, audio cut out during dialogue in missions
- Enemy lag. Somehow, in a single-player intro mission, Xenos were teleporting around as if I had connection issues
- Objects disappearing. Ammo crates, med kits just disappeared on interaction for some reason
- No ultrawide support. That's more a personal preference thing, but still

I'm happy for the people able to enjoy this game. Hopefully they address some of the blatant technical issues the game is facing eventually. Will look to try pick this up again in future.",-0.5247
Version_1,2024/9/6,1,"This isn’t just a game; it’s a pilgrimage into the grimdark glory of Warhammer 40K, where every bolter shot sings praises to the Emperor and every Tyranid screams in regret for ever invading the galaxy. You don’t play as a Space Marine — you ascend to one, crushing heretics and xenos alike with the elegance of a chainsword tearing through alien flesh.

The setting? A masterpiece of gothic despair, where every ruin and skull (so many skulls!) reminds you that the galaxy hates you — and you're here to hate it right back. Tyranids swarm like they own the place (spoiler: they don’t), and Chaos whispers temptations you answer with righteous ultraviolence.

Graphics? So good it’s practically a heretical experience. My PC now has a Machine Spirit that groans every time I boot it up. Gameplay? It’s like the Codex Astartes came to life and gave you a chainsword, saying, “Go forth and do the Emperor’s work.”

Flaws? Just one: I can’t shout FOR THE EMPEROR loud enough to match the carnage on-screen. But that’s not the game’s fault — that’s on me.

If you’ve ever wanted to stand against an endless swarm of Tyranids, crack their chitinous skulls, and tell Chaos where it can shove its warp nonsense, this is your moment.

10/10 — would purge xenos and heretics again. The Emperor approves.",-0.5258

-Enemies are bulllet sponges and Bolts (That are Mini-Rockets with high armorpiering potention) feels like .22LR on high difficualties cause enemy HP got x4 modifiers but many bolt weapon had only 2-2.5 DMG that just a joke
-Zoantopes became just flying fortreses that can instanly kill you even if you dodge it in right timing. And don't even try to take cover from beam devs think it's good idea to make them go through any obsticale.
-Chaos is just BORING. Fight against ranged enemies with pea-shooter while yjey use .50BMG with Inferno modifiers. This is just a bad joke.
-Ping issue also made ops are more stupid on higher difficulties (on ruthless and lethal we got -35% dodge invulnerability and perfect dodge windows)

PvP also got good potention and again Saber just abondon this gamemode for 3 months.

-No new gamemodes.
-No balance chages (Only nerfs good weapon)
-No shuffle teams after match that makes it's very unbalanced

Hopefully the perk systems are addressed, as a majority of the traits are either wrong to take against one of its competitors, or flat out not doing anything.

-----------------------------------
Addendum to original submission, due to outrage from Inquisitorial conclave.
-----------------------------------
Let us review the game as a whole (newest update included):
Story:
Excellent, although it seems that some footage from several servo-skulls went missing.
Low initial mission count, supplemented by same number of operations (meant for multiplayer)
Score: 6/10

Visuals:
Relay congratulations to the Artists, Remeberancers and the Tech-Priests.
Score: 10/10

Lore:
As it should be. Personal note: Not sure why a race such as the *Redacted* would have a device that actively empowers warp rifts.
Score: 9/10

Connectivity:
Needs polish. It seems sudden and unpredictable Warp-storms are causing havoc with the Astropathic choir. Sometimes the Astronomican is barely visible.
Battle-Brothers are losing connection and are unable to join their squads, which is endangering mission continuity.
Score: 5/10

Multiplayer:
PvE element fun and satisfying. With several inconsistencies which currently appear to been worked on.
Score: 6/10

PvP element. Found an archeo-tech note which reads ""Not Great, Not Terrible""
Score: *Redacted*

Customization for Space Marines:
It would seem that members of *Redacted* have stolen most other Space Marine Chapters actual Gear.
For now it seems that the Tech-Priests are repainting Ultramarine's armor and presenting it as other Chapters armor. Level of heresy is high, but acceptable until actual armor pieces are found.
Score: 4/10

Summation: Game is good and developers should be praised for what they have created.
With enough polish and additional work it would be an Excellent game. However there are several questionable decisions on release which probably are related to business decisions for content which require to be further scrutinized.
Final score 6.5/10
Original recommendation: Yes

Report submitted to Chief Interrogator.
The Emperor protects!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post-Update Review
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is my take on the current situation of the game:
- New Level - Very Good
Level design is great, new Bio-Titan is Awesome

- New Difficulty - Report to the Inquisition -
New Enraged status for Majoris is good;

Cohesion ""Leash"" - bordering on Heresy- Snipers, Heavies, Vanguards and especially Assault are getting penalized for their play style. The first too are supposed to be in the back providing fire support, the other two are supposed to be in the tick of it. -
Recommendation: Rethink the design, perhaps based on what classes do best and how they can compliment each other. Positive reinforcement is better than negative.
Examples:
Knife in the Dark -

When the Sniper and the Vanguard are in Proximity range knife damage and/or speed and/or cleaving is increased

Overlapping fields of Fire -
When the Heavy and the Tactical are in close proximity, bolt weapons damage is increased for both Marines.

There! That one! -
When the Tactical and the Sniper are in close proximity Sniper Riles deals significantly more damage to Auxpex Scanned enemies

Thunder and Fury -
When the Assault and Bulwark are in close proximity power weapons deal more damage and/or have increased attack speed

Fangs of Fenris -
When two Marines are in close proximity Chain weapons have increased cleave and/or damage

Shield against the Filth -
When the heavy and the Bulwark are in close proximity the The Iron Halo becomes a sphere and has increased ranged

Downtime after death - High Heresy -
Recommendation: For an action pack game where every second counts 120 seconds should be the absolute maximum no matter what new difficulty is introduced.


Balance changes - High Heresy -
Armor changes - Seems good.
Ammo changes - Seems good.
Recommendation: Reconsider some nerfs except the Tactical's scanner, buff the under-performing weapons instead.

Report submitted to Chief Interrogator.
Until the Heresy Levels are lowered recommendation for the game is a NO.

Introduction

Captain Titus, as a punishment for the ""death guard"", returns to regular service.You slip into the role of Lieutenant Titus, the empire needs you, the tyrannies and a much more powerful enemy threaten humanity.You fight yourself through true hordes of opponents and also have to justify yourself for your past.

Gameplay

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 divides into three areas.As a loyal soldier of the empire, of course, you first face the unfortunately too short story.In individual missions you can improve your class and equipment.The classic PvP mode then throws you in the fight for the title of the deadliest Space Marine.

I don't want to tell anything about the story itself.I definitely want to write two things.The story is told in action -packed scenes and in German.Unfortunately, unfortunately, she is told far too quickly.In general, graphics and sound leave a very good impression in the game.

In story mode you fight in a three man squad against true opponents.The NPC Marines do a good job, they know the way, but you can't really get lost, and lead one or two revival if Titus jumped into a group of opponents too quickly.The NPC Marines can also be replaced or configured by real players.The weapons can be adapted before each mission, but there are enough weapons and ammunition between the entire corpse.There is a change here and there, but you can tell that.

In addition to the story mode, individual missions can be played.Here you can choose from different classes and then equip them with suitable weapons.However, no NPCs are intended here, you need human comrades for fighting.If you start a mission alone, the game assigns you human team members and the slaughter can begin.

The PvP mode is exactly what it sounds.As the real soldier of the imperator, however, I do not fight against my own comrades!


Unfortunately I have to open a very dark chapter here.At times I was so far to write a negative review and not recommended Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2.Anyone who has read so far knows that the story is very important to me, just stupid that game has crashed in almost every sequence.So the game had to be restarted and played again to this point in order to be able to skip the sequence that was then re -established.

The fact that the lumbar churse and even the metal lock on the arm of Titus in the elevator, which is very, very slowly moved, is thrown upwards is of course only a little thing against the crashes.But I thought it was funny, so I didn't want to leave it unmentioned.



Top story told
Endless
Many different weapons
good German voice output
great graphic


Regular crashes of the intermediate sequences
Much too short story






A well told story with very good graphics and a top sound including a coherent German voice output.The battle around the universe cannot be managed better.But stop!Of course, it would be even better without the crashes.I tested the game on two computers and with several graphics cards, unfortunately without success.I still recommend the game and will write here whether the problem is fixed.",-0.6943

Version_4_5,2024/11/19,1,"The game is top, the ENT was observed even in the little things, it was such a game by Wahe that was not enough.

Plot:

Simple, but generally pleasant and does not cause rejection.

Gameplay:

In general, it is very pleasant to play.Gameplay my respect, took the formula of the first part and brought to mind.I noticed that many call bolt weapons the same type, in a sense it is, but still the difference between them is quite large.Shoot and cut enemies for a continuous pleasure, which are worth the executions.

PVP:

As a player in the PVP, it became boring quite quickly because of monotonous and mirror cards, although the game does not position itself as a competitive one.I would like to add some events or destruction, since the conditions during the game do not change in any way, Mesilovo 6 to 6 quickly bothers.

In addition, it is very sad that they did not add the customization of xcm.Dark angels will come out in December, I will assume that they still brought a chaos with a chaos)

Pve:

High -quality missions are not lagging behind the plot in terms of execution level.It is not boring to play and even recall in them.I pumped almost all classes and all weapons, and this says a lot.

The dialogs of characters sometimes deliver, especially detection)",-0.8577

Version_4_5,2024/11/28,1,"Introduction
Space Marine 2 - exciting, saturated and, most importantly for me, not a protracted adventure
both for one player and for the company of friends, because you can go through the trip.There are three types of content in the game:
The campaign is the story of Titus and its two comrades;
Operations - additional tasks that tell about the adventures of other members of the detachment, simultaneously performing their tasks.There is a pumping of equipment and classes, but I don't think,
That this can directly tighten, unless the combat system has sunk into your soul, but at least all the missions are worth passing once.
The eternal war is a multiplayer against other players, where 6 by 6 hard workers fight against each other.Honestly, I didn’t really like it, because I am not a fan of PVP content, but I do not exclude that someone likes it.

The game is an action from a third person with distortion into a near battle, as the damage
From long -range weapons, on average, below, but you should not forget about it, because not every enemy will run away with a headlong.
In close combat, you have to realize simple combinations of blows and fend off,
But do not worry, here you are not games and the attack will kindly illuminate and give enough time to the reaction.Also, enemies do not hesitate to use strong attacks that are not parked,
But you can dodge them, however, where you could fend the enemy at any time of the animation of the attack of your character, then you can dodge, as if only after the animation ended, which caused me problems.
It is possible to treat our cosmomoriac, unlike the first part, you can first first -aid kit or manage to make up for lost health in a short period of time by beating the enemy in the manner of the Bloodborne game.

The graphics in the game were admired, as well as the design of levels made with love for the universe.Many details in the animation of the characters, finishing enemies, covering armor with blood and dirt are a direct delight.The sensation of blows and firing is handed over well, as well as work with the sounds of weapons is done great, but, unfortunately, the enemies are felt, sometimes like lips for damage, which destroys immersion in the role of the strongest soldiers of the emperor.

Honestly, it’s hard for me to say, because I do not have advanced iron, but on RTX 2070, Ryzen 5 3600, 16 GB of RAM with a frequency of 3200 MHz I received ~ 45 frames in saturated bloody battles on Full HD monitor with medium graphics settings and dlss includedIn balance.
In general, it suited me and played it, quite, normal, taking into account the general quality of the picture.

First of all, I want to take the work of servers here.Their work for me remains a mystery.In operations
With random people, I received a ping of European servers, which was quite happy, but passing the campaign with a friend that lives near me, I could get as much as 600, which cited me
In a stupor.So because of this, the sound path in the cats could lag behind.Most likely, this problem was solved, but I ran into her and I cannot but mention.

The pumping in operations, in my opinion, is tightened, because in addition to pumping the class, it is necessary to pump each type of weapon separately, which is exhausted, but the weapon is divided into 4 classes of rarity and you cannot so calmly go through the maximum difficulty having the first or second rarity in the equipment of the character.

Summarizing, I want to say that the game is definitely worth playing in it, even if you are not a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe.In my opinion, you can get a unique experience that is not comparable with other games, except that only a DOOM series of games comes to mind, but this is different a bit.",-0.9916
