"Let's talk about the conclusion first. At present, passers -by are not recommended. The battle experience is qualified, but the current content is not worth buying at full price. The online PVE and PVP experience are not good.

The battle performance is great, and the big scenes are particularly shocking. Each monster has at least three types of execution actions. Macro mobs, tearing elite's refreshing refreshing is currently the only one, but it is limited to low difficulty. Once the difficulty is increased, the difficulty is increased.In the future, the underlying movement design and the level of monsters with ""bombing against, dodge"" will give you a shit experience. The monster refresh is not logical, the number is large, and it is from all directions. There is no safe area. There is no safe area.There are very few bunkers. You can even go through the wall to shoot you from all directions. You can even wear a wall to shoot you (probably BUG). You are difficult to clean up them with low -performance long -range remote weapons and prone to bottoming ammunition.The toughness is very poor, and the power of the thunder hammer will be punching and flying, not to mention the multiple elite melee monsters mixed in the miscellaneous soldiers make you hardly finish a complete melee companyAlmost endlessly, the task goal of ""saving antenna"" in the tide is endless. If you bring two NPCs that can't do things, you are even more painful.
In addition, the battle will not give any rewards, and only a few cooperation levels will be unlocked, which makes it no heavy value for players.The latter levels of the cooperation level are very disgusting, resulting in almost only the first two levels of the online PVE, the 12 pictures that were originally made, only 2 or even 1 by players chose to play repeatedly. Players can only choose to choose for efficiency to choose for efficiency.I choose one in the boring and eat shit for freshness.

It is not so unbalanced, it is a poor performance of melee and long -range weapons as a whole. It does not match the number and strength of monsters. The positioning of firearms is close to the rifle submachine gun of ordinary shooting games.Canned samurai, chaotic Gatling rockets will also have canned dog tough dogs. In the face of them, you have almost no effective counter -counter on the offensive end.It seems that the multiple elites to death seem to be the hot melting gun, and the shotgun can not even make any hard straight to the elite.In the melee, there are higher technical level requirements, but the upper limit is lower.
The above reasons lead to the difficulty of medium high, that is, in the PVE that starts from difficulty 2, the player's choice is very limited. In addition to the hot melting gun, the high -damage and the grenades are poured to death.It is completely absent from melee.

The current development system is very simple, PVE output:
① Vocational experience → Upgrade, order professional talent
② Weapon experience → Weapon upgrades, upgrade needs → Give the talent of weapon after proficiency
③ Weapon data → Used for weapon upgrades, hard bundling with difficulty, can also be used to directly proficient in the weapon you don’t want to practice
④ Currency → Point professional talent, buy weapons, and buy coat -pairing armor accessories all need
It can be found that in addition to experience and currency, the only special props produced is weapon data, and the weapon data will soon overflow. One type of weapon is needed.bored.The output of all levels is almost the same, which also makes players only choose 1-2 easiest levels to swipe.Of course, I don't think it is a good design to swipe the entry, but it does lack diversity.
The only development of PVP is to get the battle experience to unlock the battle level, so as to unlock the types of weapons that can be configured in each profession.

The design of the PVP battle itself can only be said to be ""general"", which is a very ordinary shooting battle, and the biggest feature system of this game is invisible in PVP.
The most important problem with PVP is:
① No system!
Except for the game, there are no systems, no rankings, no competition systems, and matching all relying on fate. Only the player level and professional level accumulated according to experience will show you.
② Cheating!
The production team is almost lying flat for anti -cheating. Except for a small blue bear that does not have any effect on cheating, there are no measures!Not even the report button!I even doubt that the production team will not be processed. Even if you are infinitely thunderous, you will be disgusting in the PVP of this picture. Especially after the unlocking of No. 10, you will be seen.After the hybrids who came to China to travel across the second, everyone was honest.Who would have thought that ten of the dozen of the cheating beasts are all foreign friends who have taught Chinese.

In addition to the transition kit with a little detail in the middle, there are only 2 sets of appearance in each occupation, which are unlocked according to the field. In addition, there are very few appearances that can be unlocked.Basically reflected in color matching.

In terms of my personal configuration, there is no problem optimizing, and the game of the same level screen is difficult to find better than this game. I need to adjust the settings separately to not card.The number of frames outside the maximum pulk is stable, and the difference between the thirty or forty frames of the leakage engineering version is very obvious.
There are many small problems, including but not limited to:
Select the secondary display by default. After the settings are settled, he will give you the default selection of the secondary display, but the display in the settings 1 and 2 is replaced;
The first day of PVE cannot be loaded into the server, but the next day is repaired;
Sometimes hitting will cause the characters to be stuck in the character. After a few seconds, it must be rolled to be rolled and so on ...

Overall, the quality of this game is qualified and I like it very much, and although there are many problems, most of the problems can greatly optimize the experience. The PVE and PVP systems need to be changed.Don't want to play this PVP.The gap in the production capacity of art is very large. It requires new maps, new levels, new monsters, and a large number of new custom armor, otherwise there will be only grades to brush.Therefore, this game does not recommend the current full price purchase.

"There are big problems in combat design.None of the simplest values ​​to the lowest bottom combat interaction.The production team wants to combine melee remote and other combat methods, but the result is all pulling.
Most of the battles in the game are given a large space and then brushed a large number of enemies with a large amount of reunification, but the performance of the player's role is not enough to clear the melee enemies or in turn.Compared with the high -pressure worm nest or chaos, players' weakness of solution is not worth mentioning, and the empty venue design and powerlessness of remote attacks even make the player unable to do it. Slowness is dead.
The reverse feel is very strange. According to the prompt button, it may not be able to play perfectly. The overall judgment highlights a mystery, and the humorous gun is decided to control itself for a second.At the same time, defense or dodge cannot interrupt the current attack action in the battle, and I don't know if it is BUG or what.And even so, elite enemies often appear to cooperate with attacks, and the hard straight after the rebound was attacked by other elite monsters.
In addition, the hard -straight mechanism is also very disgusting. If the attacking is hard, it will cause it to be suppressed when facing multiple enemies or specific joint moves.
The poor supply in the level is poor. I do n’t know if it is difficult for the action mode to be able to pick up 4 medical packages from beginning to end: this is almost the need for a character's blood volume.
The enemy's attack method is also very against the sky. Most of the long -range elites can hardly attack the attack to change the blood, especially the brainworm is the most outrageous.As a BUFF, an enemy with a large range of remote attacks and flying one has a thick outrageous blood volume, which is pure against the sky.Get priority. If there are too many blood, it will not be dropped. Finally, it will be processed. It will BUFF other enemies, and will use high -frequency attacks to force players to dodge.
In addition to judging mystery, BOSS is relatively small. In addition to the enhanced brainworm BOSS on the main line, most of the AOE is too much other than the sky.
The summary is that the battery life and control methods of players are very weaker than the 1st generation, but the enemy has increased a lot in both the number and strength.The enemies in the face surpassed the player's performance battle experience.
Although I think the dark tide is also a spam game, I think Saber should go to play 500 hours of dark tide and redesign this game.
See how the dark tide is done:
In a complex environment, players have bunkers and corners to rely on and let the enemy gather in the same place.Melee enemies will block the gun line of the remote enemy.Players have a strong skill to solve the field, and have a sliding shovel to avoid long -range attacks.
There are fixed medical stations in the level, fixed number of medical boxes and supply boxes, as well as randomly distributed medical needles and ammunition.Regardless of enough, at least not so digging.
The enemy design may be the best place for dark tide. Although it has appeared because of the value, the overall performance is in a reasonable range due to the value of the sky or a machine gunner.
The dark tide BOSS is relatively not too colorful, but it is still not inferior to Star Warrior 2. At least there is nothing to rely on invincible frames to hide from the sky full -screen AOE.
Considering that the dark tide is not the first to make, my evaluation is the future.At present, no one is recommended (unless you really like the IP 40K IP and have good tolerance for the garbage system) before the production team is greatly modified.","战斗设计中存在很大的问题。最低的底部战斗互动的最简单值都没有。生产团队希望将近战遥控器和其他战斗方法结合在一起，但结果都是拉动的。
游戏中的大多数战斗都有很大的空间，然后用大量的统一刷了大量敌人，但是玩家的角色表现不足以清除近战敌人，或者依靠高。- 压力蠕虫巢或混乱，玩家的解决方案弱点不值得一提，空的场地设计和远程攻击的无能为力甚至使玩家无法做到。慢病已经死了。
相反的感觉非常奇怪。根据提示按钮，它可能无法完美地播放。总体判断突出了一个谜，幽默的枪被决定控制一秒钟。在同一时间，防守或道奇无法中断战斗中当前的攻击行动，我不知道这是错误还是什么即便如此，精英敌人通常似乎与攻击合作，而反弹后的艰难直接遭到其他精英怪物的攻击。
此外，硬伸直机制也非常令人恶心。如果攻击很难，则在面对多个敌人或特定的关节移动时会被抑制。
水平的供应量很差。我不知道动作模式从头到尾都无法拿起4个医疗包装：这几乎是对角色的血量的需求。
敌人的攻击方法也非常反对天空。大多数漫长的精英们几乎无法攻击攻击以改变血液，尤其是脑虫是最残酷的。作为抛光剂，是一个遥远的远程攻击和飞行的敌人纯净的天空。如果血液太多，它将不会掉落。最后，将进行处理。它将掩盖其他敌人，并将使用高频攻击来迫使玩家躲避。
除了判断神秘之外，老板还相对较小。除了主线上增强的脑虫老板外，大多数AOE除了天空外太多了。
摘要是，球员的电池寿命和控制方法比第一代弱，但敌人的数量和力量都增加了很多。面部的敌人超过了球员的表现战。
尽管我认为黑潮也是垃圾邮件游戏，但我认为Saber应该去玩500小时的黑暗潮汐并重新设计这款游戏。
看看黑潮的完成方式：
在一个复杂的环境中，玩家有掩体和角落可以依靠，让敌人聚集在同一地点。MeleeEnemies将阻止偏远敌人的枪支线。玩者具有强大的技巧来解决该领域，并且有一个滑行铲子避免长时间攻击。
有固定的医疗站，固定数量的医疗盒和供应盒，以及随机分布的医疗针和弹药。不足，至少没有那么挖掘。
敌人的设计可能是黑潮的最佳场所。尽管由于价值而出现，但由于天空或机器枪手的价值，总体性能在合理的范围内。
黑暗的潮汐老板相对不太丰富多彩，但它仍然不如Star Warrior 2。至少没有什么可以依靠无敌的框架来躲藏在天空中的Aoe。
考虑到黑潮不是第一个进行的，我的评估是未来。在目前，没有人建议在生产团队进行大规模修改之前，除非您真的很喜欢IP 40K IP，并且对垃圾系统具有良好的容忍度）。",-0.9989,"{'Nickname': 'MrMarionette14', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '29.6', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMarionette14/', 'Comment': ""There are big problems in combat design.None of the simplest values \u200b\u200bto the lowest bottom combat interaction.The production team wants to combine melee remote and other combat methods, but the result is all pulling.\nMost of the battles in the game are given a large space and then brushed a large number of enemies with a large amount of reunification, but the performance of the player's role is not enough to clear the melee enemies or in turn.Compared with the high -pressure worm nest or chaos, players' weakness of solution is not worth mentioning, and the empty venue design and powerlessness of remote attacks even make the player unable to do it.

"Today, in 2024, the IP of War Hammer has spent decades like the history of the whole video game. In the process, many types of games of the Warhammer series have also been born, such as the full war of war hammers, the doomsday plague,, Dark tide and so on.As the level of the standard gaming industry, this Star Warrior 2 has also set another major tools for the Warhammer series games.I have to say that the IP of the Warhammer is very lucky. Regardless of the subsequent operation of the dark tide and Star warrior 2, the overall quality of the game is really high.



This interstellar warrior 2 points into 3 modes. The battle mode Players play the Tempus team to end the enemy's conspiracy in the 8th war.Different tasks of the same battle are performed. This model has a professional and weapon RPG system, and it also undertakes the elements of brushing in the game.The last is a PVP mode without numerical growth. The built -in level is only used to unlock weapon use permissions.



The overall design of this game is actually very traditional. The three modes are completely separated. Each performs its duties.As a result, when I encountered an accident and entered the story of this article, I became a small captain. There were two less obedient teammates who performed a variety of smaller tasks in the big events.At the same time, each level is plugged into some big scenes and multi -performance scripts that are increasingly rare today.In the process, the protagonist and teammates were slowly displayed, and finally faced a decisive battle in the face of the big crisis.This is also a feature of the old ASS game. Even if the process is spoiled before the game, when you really play, you can still feel excited and trembling when you hear these things, these characters, these large -scale scenes happen in front of them.



At the same time, there are many classic interpretations of the Warhammer's series in the battle. Players who are familiar with the IP are afraid that they can already imagine the development direction of the story before they start, but the plot of the masterpiece who has never been exposed to the war hammer is also very simple and direct.It is very eliminated by the previous cause of the consequences. There is no need to buy novels and comics to understand the plot's riddle design. There is no great understanding of the cost. It is very friendly to outsiders.For Hammer's details, the game is full of details. For example, in the process, the door that the star army cannot be lifted by the Star Warriors will make the Hammer smile, and this performance can be in other players.Simply see the strength of the protagonist.



There are also various classic war hammer links, such as Qibing, Guishan, a classic plot: The Extreme Legion of Grand Rican in the genetically preliminaries, the ICU war god, the blue man, the whole galaxy of the Galaxy,The hardest man, the electric pole holding the space of the space of the space as a weapon, the dry explosion of Tyron's nest owner, the one punch to kill the god of war, the two punching Angolas dog meat, the two hearts of the chaotic sacred place, the super rush man——Aarga!(His stretcher team) debut!Single -up!




The sense of blow and control of the game itself is also very top -level, so that players really think that what we control is a 3 -meter -high super brother, whether it is the walking posture caused by the huge armor or various melee weapons to fight on the Terlen Zerg.How powerful can players feel how powerful our fists of these 300,000 horsepower are.
The game itself's combat system is also very unique. The advantages of playing games such as wolf are integrated into this game. Of course, if you play with key mouse and mouse, you must change all the keys except WASD.In the battle, we have two explosive shotguns and a melee weapon to reduce the blood volume of the enemy to a certain degree after a certain degree.The invincible state rushed up to perform a happy execution animation, and a very good setting was to cancel all actions and shake before execution.At the same time, there is also a player mechanism in the game. The enemy attacks two types: red and blue. When you are attacked, you will see a blue light effect first.Anti -success, the middle judgment frame is relatively abundant. In addition to a few consecutive attacks, we need to play twice, at this time we can shoot directly into the state of the gun, but since the gun decision is remote execution, it is also reasonable to delete the invincible effect.EssenceAt the same time, the point that is not mentioned in the game is that the red attack can also be perfectly dodge and then the gun decisions, and all mobs attacks in this game can be played. Therefore, theoretically, it is theoretically. In theory, we can only use melee.Still my round battle.



Then other designs determine that this set of mechanisms cannot run perfectly. For example, the cost of a worm in the Terren worm is not as expensive as a bullet.When the soldiers surrounded the surrounding enemies and the long -range soldiers that could only be resolved with guns, they also used a bouncing knife in some gaps.Although it is easy to bombs, it is also necessary to consider the risk of failure. In the game, players' attacks and attacks are too hard, and often face the surrounding situation. No matter what difficulty, sometimes a operation error will be dead.This has also led players to rarely use this ability without proficiency.



However, the game itself is very encouraged to fight. Our interstellar warrior first has a shield. No matter what you execute, you can directly reply to the shield.After the shield is broken, the blood first is the deficiency blood. Similar attacks with the blood can directly reply to the deficiency blood, and the deficiency of this game is one to one and the time is not short. Sometimes you hit the mob in the strange pile.How much I sucked back.



However, this game has stuffed a lot of long -range monsters in the level of the level, allowing many of the above -mentioned combat methods to lose room, and the long -range monster attack frequency and accuracy of this game are not low.However, there is a setting to kill the long -range elite. The mobs next to the mobs will die by themselves. However, this tutorial is hidden in the PVE character challenge. At this time, the production team may be the hammer.The younger brothers around the big tools will die.



And the production team fills the value with the foot. At present, some weapons are very balanced, and the hot melt is destroyed. The energy weapons in the world's view are effective in this game.The most difficult monster giant meat, AI and AI during the war of AI, do nothing, but 80%of the injury reduction can not die.However, the battle is generally recommended to play low difficulty, which is also in line with the intensity of the original star soldiers. After all, there will be no other rewards except for achievements.If you really want to challenge the difficulty, you still go to the PVE mode. After all, PVE must be difficult to upgrade in the future. Do not start the battle directly to the jail like me. In this process, you will also appreciate the script performance during the battle.



The production team of the level design is still more in the zombie world war. Many levels have a very strong sense of vision. Generally, it is not very good, and the level is quite satisfactory.However, some level design is a bit dung. For example, there is a level in the middle that needs to be held by Peng Teller to defend in the mouse pile. In the case of a huge long -range monster, you need to use the fireproofer to burn the ground from time to time to place the mechanism.The name AI teammate is even more painful. AI has nothing to do. The output and the header can only be handed over to the player themselves.




The rendering style of this game is very unique and incomplete, especially the armor of the Star Warrior, which is more like using various shadow spraying and making old battle flags.Look at it for a long time.In PVE and PVP, players can also customize armor. At this time, the color of the game civil war group is consistent with the color name of the flag paint in reality.Maybe this is also a business strategy, but in general, it is not bad.



However, some issues of this work are also introduced here. At present, the first version of the battle and 6 levels of PVE, each level is about an hour, and many colors of custom armor need to spend the game in the game for purchasing in the game, and the game of the game, and the game, and the purchase of the game in the game.This token demand is very large. At present, the content of 6 levels in the area is really difficult to support the players' long brush, and the follow -up armor style of each occupation in PVE needs to be unlocked.If you want to unlock the full unlock at least 204 PVEs, this is really exaggerated. Obviously, unlocking the armor of each occupation into a general can reduce the amount of more than half of the content. Unfortunately, the production team did not choose this.



The PVP of this work is more traditional, nor is it the focus of the production team. Many functions do not want to do it. For exampleYou can also wear a shield directly. Generally speaking, the depth is not high, but I am more worried that when I play PVP on the first day, I encounter plug -in. I want to report but find that there is no report method in the game. I encounter this situation.You can only choose to exit, but there is no punishment for exit.It can only be said that the little blue bear specially added by the production team is not very useful for this PVP. After all the dust is settled, the PVP should not be played by everyone except for everyone.



However, it is worth mentioning that after experiencing the dark tide, I first had high expectations for the music of this game, but after the actual opening of the game, you asked me the music of Star Warrior 2. I found that I couldn't remember what the music of this game was at all.It looks, but the sound effect of the relative game is very good. The large -caliber of the shotgun is a large -caliber break, and the impact sound of the internal institution of the firearm.There is also a very detailed place that players can choose whether to bring helmets in the settings, which will also directly affect the role dialogue sound effects.



In general, this game is a very standardized product of the game industry. It has normal level design, a more unique combat system, and lack of combat design experience leads to a slightly higher strength of the long -range mobs.At the same time, I have invested more compromised resources, and there should be a real hammer to provide ideas in the production team. This resource is really spent on the blade.Perform madly; know that if you do n’t do much, then stack the relevant design densely within 7 hours of the battle; know what the hammer wants to see, then focus on this aspect;, Show the whole story in the eyes of the player in a very clear attitude.This is very valuable in today's European and American game industry.","Today, in 2024, the IP of War Hammer has spent decades like the history of the whole video game. In the process, many types of games of the Warhammer series have also been born, such as the full war of war hammers, the doomsday plague,, Dark tide and so on.As the level of the standard gaming industry, this Star Warrior 2 has also set another major tools for the Warhammer series games.I have to say that the IP of the Warhammer is very lucky. Regardless of the subsequent operation of the dark tide and Star warrior 2, the overall quality of the game is really high.



This interstellar warrior 2 points into 3 modes. The battle mode Players play the Tempus team to end the enemy's conspiracy in the 8th war.Different tasks of the same battle are performed. This model has a professional and weapon RPG system, and it also undertakes the elements of brushing in the game.The last is a PVP mode without numerical growth. The built -in level is only used to unlock weapon use permissions.



The overall design of this game is actually very traditional. The three modes are completely separated. Each performs its duties.As a result, when I encountered an accident and entered the story of this article, I became a small captain. There were two less obedient teammates who performed a variety of smaller tasks in the big events.At the same time, each level is plugged into some big scenes and multi -performance scripts that are increasingly rare today.In the process, the protagonist and teammates were slowly displayed, and finally faced a decisive battle in the face of the big crisis.This is also a feature of the old ASS game. Even if the process is spoiled before the game, when you really play, you can still feel excited and trembling when you hear these things, these characters, these large -scale scenes happen in front of them.



At the same time, there are many classic interpretations of the Warhammer's series in the battle. Players who are familiar with the IP are afraid that they can already imagine the development direction of the story before they start, but the plot of the masterpiece who has never been exposed to the war hammer is also very simple and direct.It is very eliminated by the previous cause of the consequences. There is no need to buy novels and comics to understand the plot's riddle design. There is no great understanding of the cost. It is very friendly to outsiders.For Hammer's details, the game is full of details. For example, in the process, the door that the star army cannot be lifted by the Star Warriors will make the Hammer smile, and this performance can be in other players.Simply see the strength of the protagonist.



There are also various classic war hammer links, such as Qibing, Guishan, a classic plot: The Extreme Legion of Grand Rican in the genetically preliminaries, the ICU war god, the blue man, the whole galaxy of the Galaxy,The hardest man, the electric pole holding the space of the space of the space as a weapon, the dry explosion of Tyron's nest owner, the one punch to kill the god of war, the two punching Angolas dog meat, the two hearts of the chaotic sacred place, the super rush man——Aarga!(His stretcher team) debut!Single -up!




The sense of blow and control of the game itself is also very top -level, so that players really think that what we control is a 3 -meter -high super brother, whether it is the walking posture caused by the huge armor or various melee weapons to fight on the Terlen Zerg.How powerful can players feel how powerful our fists of these 300,000 horsepower are.
The game itself's combat system is also very unique. The advantages of playing games such as wolf are integrated into this game. Of course, if you play with key mouse and mouse, you must change all the keys except WASD.In the battle, we have two explosive shotguns and a melee weapon to reduce the blood volume of the enemy to a certain degree after a certain degree.The invincible state rushed up to perform a happy execution animation, and a very good setting was to cancel all actions and shake before execution.At the same time, there is also a player mechanism in the game. The enemy attacks two types: red and blue. When you are attacked, you will see a blue light effect first.Anti -success, the middle judgment frame is relatively abundant. In addition to a few consecutive attacks, we need to play twice, at this time we can shoot directly into the state of the gun, but since the gun decision is remote execution, it is also reasonable to delete the invincible effect.EssenceAt the same time, the point that is not mentioned in the game is that the red attack can also be perfectly dodge and then the gun decisions, and all mobs attacks in this game can be played. Therefore, theoretically, it is theoretically. In theory, we can only use melee.Still my round battle.

"The game is fun.With a heavy blow, Space Marine is a good way to use a heavy armor.The sound also forms a heavy and suitable atmosphere.The game system has a familiar system that avoids the paring of Sekiro and the unknown attacks.It is fun to slice the enemy while adding a single shot.The directing is also good, whether or not you like the existing Warhammer or not.Graphics are good and optimized.

But it's not enough to be a 70,000 won money game.The campaign is long but very repeated.It is a repetition of killing, moving, opening the door, killing enemies that do not change much.Even the boss war is only a reinforcement of elite enemies, except for the final boss, all of them are repeated again.There are some places that are even boring because there are few types of enemies.

The worst is the long -range enemy, but all of the distant enemies in the game are powerful, but they are as strong as the nearest enemies, they are not good at eating stiffness, and most of the long -distance horses of players are garbage levels.If you do a fire war, you can lose money.The tracking performance is also good, so even if you roll it, it will be hit by two or three shots, so the damage will be accumulated.The most fucking sound is Joan Sniff, but every time a developer's parents are curious once.Death's angel -based stamina is also in Grogi to put two or three magazines, but it is floating in the air, making it impossible to see other enemies when dealing with, and throwing a bulge projectile continuously.Most of these babies are paired each other, and when they start throwing the projectile with a stack, they are busy to avoid it.When you get a plasma insignator or Rasfusil, you'll be more stiff except for the super -distance weapon, Melta Rifle, and the firepower is also idiot.There are also extremely small means of recovery, but the ranged ratio is not small, so it is the main cause of tiredness in the game.

It is never recommended to make this game a difficult difficulty.The completeness of the game is not good, so no matter how hard it is, the difficulty is so lush that it is only seen as it was released.The distance above is very large, but the gun is more useless and the ranged ratio increases in the second half.If the enemies are fired and guns, they will taste hell. Allies are brain death, so even if you pinging to T, even if you are right next to you, you stand still and do nothing.As mentioned above, there are few means of recovery, but one of them is a slow speed, and it has to be sink kills to restore shields, and it does not fit for a long time, and the sink kills adds a sense of blow, but if it is too abused, the game is cut off.You have to keep killing, so it is a factor that continues to break the game flow.Increasingly, difficulty becomes a game that forcibly pushes checkpoints.After filling up, it's fucking stupid.Because of this, this game is not right for those looking for challenging and difficult games.The difficulty of this game is just irrational and boring.There's no reason to do it because it shows a special reward for clearing the game with the highest difficulty, and showing a minimum challenge and laziness without me.

In other words, the game has a great potential with attractive design and system, but unfortunately, it is a flat -ranged weapon that is close to Airsoft and a distant enemy that comes out of the fuck.It's better if you have a friend to work together.If you like Warhammer Franchise and you are more interested in Warhammer than the game itself, you can live.

30,000 won recommended","游戏很有趣。对于沉重的打击，太空海洋是使用重型装甲的好方法。声音还形成了沉重且合适的氛围。游戏系统具有熟悉的系统，可以避免Sekiro和未知的攻击。在添加一枪的同时将敌人切成薄片很有趣。导演也是好的，无论您是否喜欢现有的战锤。Graphics都很好且优化。

但这还不足以成为70,000韩元游戏。这项运动很漫长，但重复了。这是重复杀戮，移动，打开门，杀死不会改变太大的敌人。即使老板战争只是强化精英敌人，除了最终的老板，所有这些都再次重复。有些地方甚至很无聊，因为敌人类型很少。

最糟糕的是较长的敌人，但是游戏中的所有遥远敌人都很强大，但是它们和最近的敌人一样强大，他们不擅长吃僵硬，而且大多数远距离的球员都是垃圾级别。如果您进行消防战争，您可能会损失钱。跟踪性能也不错，因此即使您滚动，它也会被两到三枪击中，因此损坏将会累积。最他妈的声音是琼·斯尼夫（Joan Sniff），但是每当开发商的父母都好奇一次。天使的耐力也在格罗吉（Grogi）中，也要放两三个杂志，但它在空中漂浮，使得在与其他敌人打交道时，并且无法在处理和连续扔一个凸起的弹丸。这些婴儿中的大多数是彼此配对的，当他们开始用堆栈扔弹丸时，他们会忙于避免它。当您得到血浆iNsignator或rasfusil时，您会更加僵硬，除了超级距离武器，梅尔塔步枪和火力也是白痴，也有很小的恢复手段，但范围的比例并不小，因此这是游戏中疲倦的主要原因。

从不建议让这个游戏变得困难。游戏的完整性不好，因此，无论它有多困难，难度都如此郁郁葱葱，以至于仅在发布时才能看到它。上面的距离非常大，但是枪支更加无用，下半场的比例增加了。如果敌人被开枪和枪支，他们会尝到地狱的味道。盟友是脑死亡，因此，即使您在t上ping，即使您就在您旁边，您也站着不动并无所作为。如上所述，恢复的手段很少，但是其中之一是一个慢速，并且它必须被杀死以恢复盾牌，并且很长一段时间都不适合，而且水槽杀死会增加打击感，但是如果太虐待了，比赛就会被切断。这是一个继续打破游戏流程的因素。发现难度成为强行推动检查点的游戏。填补后，这真是愚蠢。因为这个游戏不适合那些寻找挑战性和困难游戏的人。这个游戏的困难只是不合理的和无聊的。没有理由这样做，因为它对以最高的困难清理游戏显示出了特殊的回报，并且在没有我的情况下表现出了最低限度的挑战和懒惰。

换句话说，游戏具有诱人的设计和系统的巨大潜力，但不幸的是，它是一种扁平的武器，靠近气枪和一个遥不可及的敌人，这是从他妈的出来的。一起工作。如果您喜欢战锤特许经营权，并且您对战锤比游戏本身更感兴趣，那么您可以生活。

Allies are brain death, so even if you pinging to T, even if you are right next to you, you stand still and do nothing.As mentioned above, there are few means of recovery, but one of them is a slow speed, and it has to be sink kills to restore shields, and it does not fit for a long time, and the sink kills adds a sense of blow, but if it is too abused, the game is cut off.You have to keep killing, so it is a factor that continues to break the game flow.Increasingly, difficulty becomes a game that forcibly pushes checkpoints.After filling up, it's fucking stupid.Because of this, this game is not right for those looking for challenging and difficult games.The difficulty of this game is just irrational and boring.There's no reason to do it because it shows a special reward for clearing the game with the highest difficulty, and showing a minimum challenge and laziness without me.\n\nIn other words, the game has a great potential with attractive design and system, but unfortunately, it is a flat -ranged weapon that is close to Airsoft and a distant enemy that comes out of the fuck.It's better if you have a friend to work together.If you like Warhammer Franchise and you are more interested in Warhammer than the game itself, you can live.\n\n30,000 won recommended"", 'Date': '2024/9/10', 'Language': 'ko'}",Success
"At the moment:

At high levels, the game turns into Elden Ring: endless dodgers and rolls.Not difficult, but just not fun.

Bolter weapon is absolutely useless.The plasmagan is useless.Numerous weapons are mostly useless.

Meltagan is better than all other options due to a lot of damage and restoration of even lost health if you have at least a bit of white.

Some classes, such as an attack aircraft, are just worse than other options: what is the point of it if Vangard does everything better than him?Jetpak is very naval.

Lock class in operations is a very stupid solution: do you want to play highly difficult?Swear 2 classes at least otherwise you will stand for 5 minutes in peeps with another tactician in the detachment.

The balance of opponents is very strange: Tzaangors with shields withstand a power fist in the face with a blow.A simple warrior of Nidov withstands 4 shot of Meltagan in the face.The enemies are very accurately shooting and refusing to fight in close combat even close, preferring to back and shoot while the player has to swing forward, since most of the weapons of near -battle do not have a moment in attacks on attacks.

The gameplay design is very strange too: what is the point of Gan Strike if the invulnerability window is so small?What is the point of it if the simplest tyranids remove armor in 1 blow?The mechanics of the parry is cool but only works in 1 by 1 or 2 by 1. More?You can not even try.Plus, why fend to parry when the dumts do the same thing only work on red attacks that cannot be spaced?

PVP is generally quiet horror: Vangard is the most broken class.Hook-> You shoot point blank from the carbine and win duel 1 on 1 with any class.Against Bulvarka, you just bother and make a hook again if it raised a shield.Most of the long -range weapons have above the traffic police than the near -battle weapons, so it’s better to just shoot at point blank range because there is no animation interruption.Therefore, at the moment, PVP is just running around and shooting from carbines at point blank range for the most part.

Campaign: in general, it is well done, but if you play 3+ difficulties, then again the Elden Ring turns out and not the cosmodes simulator that spoils the sensations.The bots are absolutely useless and stupid, therefore, you can not even count on them.

Castomization: generally good.Colors and the ability to combine colors are very cool.The current pieces of armor for each class look good but frankly little.In fact, the last shooting range of cosmetics is just the 1st shooting range hung with seals and other things.In general, I would like more.

Operations: In general, interesting.But the absence of the director of Ishishka is felt.They become very monotonous literally on the 4th entry.The absence of specialists and a greater variety of elite opponents affects the general impression negatively.Plus, again, due to high complexity, you often just run past the opponents to the elevator/script since the economy of health and armor is absent on high difficulties in operations.If we talk about the characters' builds, then everything is scarce here.There are no gameplay elements in pumping weapons and classes.Very dull ""5% more damage"" or extremely rarely something in the spirit ""get 1 full store at low health levels.""

In general, I am disappointed with how I came out cm2.They should work hard on the gameplay design and the behavior of opponents and a common balance.At the moment, people like everything, but these problems will begin to beat very much along the life expectancy of the game literally a month after the release if you do not make changes.","眼下：

在高水平上，游戏变成了埃尔登（Elden）戒指：无尽的道奇和滚动。并不困难，但并不有趣。

螺栓武器绝对没有用。

由于您至少有一点点白色，Meltagan比所有其他选择都要好。

有些课程，例如攻击飞机，比其他选择要糟糕：如果Vangard做的一切都比他更好？Jetpak的意义是什么？

运营中的锁定课程是一个非常愚蠢的解决方案：您想打得非常困难吗？至少向2堂课发誓，否则您将与另一个战术家偷窥5分钟。

对手的平衡非常奇怪：带有盾牌的tzaangors用打击的拳头承受着拳头。尼多夫的一个简单战士忍受了4杆的脸上的4枪。近距离，更喜欢在球员必须向前挥舞时向后射击，因为近战的大多数武器都没有攻击攻击的时刻。

游戏玩法的设计也很奇怪：如果无敌性窗口如此之小，甘罢工的意义是什么？如果最简单的霸王龙以1击卸下盔甲，那是什么意义？1乘1或2乘1。更多？您甚至都不能尝试。此外，当Dumts做同样的事情时，为什么只能对无法间隔的红色攻击行动？

PVP通常是安静的恐怖：Vangard是最折断的班级。大多数长距离武器比近战武器都高于交通警察，因此最好在空白处拍摄，因为没有动画中断。卡宾枪在空白范围内大部分。

广告系列：总的来说，这是做好的，但是如果您扮演3个以上的困难，那么Elden戒指再次出现，而不是破坏感觉的Cosmodes模拟器。机器人绝对没有用和愚蠢，因此，您甚至都无法计数在他们身上。

estomatization：通常很好。颜色和结合颜色的能力非常酷。每个班级的盔甲看起来都不错，但坦率地说，化妆品的最后一次射击范围只是第一个射击范围总的来说，我想要更多。

操作：一般而言，有趣的是，但是感觉到Ishishka董事的缺席。它们从字面上看第四条就变得非常单调。缺乏专家和更多的精英对手对一般的印象产生了负面影响。高度复杂性，您经常只越过电梯/剧本的对手，因为健康和装甲的经济不存在运营困难。抽水武器和课堂上的元素。非常沉闷的“损害5％”或很少在精神中的东西“在低健康水平上获得1个完整的商店”。

总的来说，我对自己的出现感到失望。如果您不进行更改，则该游戏的预期寿命实际上是在发布后一个月。",-0.9985,"{'Nickname': 'Seortan', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '21.1', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992417260/', 'Comment': 'At the moment:\n\nAt high levels, the game turns into Elden Ring: endless dodgers and rolls.Not difficult, but just not fun.\n\nBolter weapon is absolutely useless.The plasmagan is useless.Numerous weapons are mostly useless.\n\nMeltagan is better than all other options due to a lot of damage and restoration of even lost health if you have at least a bit of white.\n\nSome classes, such as an attack aircraft, are just worse than other options: what is the point of it if Vangard does everything better than him?Jetpak is very naval.\n\nLock class in operations is a very stupid solution: do you want to play highly difficult?Swear 2 classes at least otherwise you will stand for 5 minutes in peeps with another tactician in the detachment.\n\nThe balance of opponents is very strange: Tzaangors with shields withstand a power fist in the face with a blow.A simple warrior of Nidov withstands 4 shot of Meltagan in the face.The enemies are very accurately shooting and refusing to fight in close combat even close, preferring to back and shoot while the player has to swing forward, since most of the weapons of near -battle do not have a moment in attacks on attacks.\n\nThe gameplay design is very strange too: what is the point of Gan Strike if the invulnerability window is so small?What is the point of it if the simplest tyranids remove armor in 1 blow?The mechanics of the parry is cool but only works in 1 by 1 or 2 by 1.

The picture is beautiful and carefully seen that the character's rough face, the red helmet on the face, all day is not paralyzed, but the overall is qualified.

Effect sound gun sound is monotonous and unqualified

Shooting melee strike is not enough
I am all interstellar warriors. I shot a shot of a shot and hit the weakest bug. You do n’t give me the effect. If you are not threatened by the bug, you will pile more little mobs to shoot me. Elastic
However, the guns are executed and the dodge is done well

Single battle plot level design is qualified
There are counts, such as the bridge section of devouring insects is impressive
And changed the company's production to pay tribute to the bridge section of the previous work (I was excavated when I left everyone)

However, there are still a lot of pain points below the disadvantage of the cooperation mode containing End Game

The following starts to vomit

The hardness of the medium -sized elite enemy is unreasonable and almost hit the entire magazine bullet to kill a ordinary elite monster
However, sometimes it is time for a monster to be born. Sometimes it is possible to produce 7-8 elites at a time and then cross the entire formation and slaughter the entire team.
If you want to be slaughtered, you have to take the supermodel hot -melt gun to fight

And you let me play an elite, you have to use a magazine, you give me enough ammunition?! !?!!!

The increase in each level of the shot of the cooperation mode cannot be pursued by the monster unless you get a new gun to abuse the dishes to abuse the dishes.
The effect of the character's specialty tree is not obvious, please learn from the black tide, okay ??

There are a lot of unreasonable little knives for weapon specialties to kill 10 enemies before how to kill ??!!!!

The above bounds are all uncomfortable points at all
I doubt whether the producer has played his own game

The following is the design vomiting

The level route is exactly a single consecutive point of exploration (of course, the producer did not do anything to collect ...)
And there are only 6 pictures to be sincere ??? Do you look at the remnant2? !!? !???????????????????

If you make this cooperation model, a bunch of collection of collectors may wish to get some equipment for us ..........

And why do you only give 3 people a team? !?! Do you know how many people in the Astart Sage instructions? !?!?!!

EPIC online problem

This game also adopts the form of the luxury version of the first experience. First, it means that loyalty also takes the test first, and first experience the BUG, ​​but when the EPIC online service appears at the beginning of the game, it really makes me worry aboutTo stop me, it is more about the launch.But I believe that many good brothers are still troubled by EPIC service updates, and provide two solutions to everyone.
1. Card EPIC service update: Close the game and Steam; open the EPIC acceleration of the accelerator; search for the EPIC process in the Windows task manager and turn it off all: then open Steam to check the integrity of the game; click the game, re -update the EPIC Online ServiceEnter the game.
2. EPIC service update is still unable to play the game: enter the installation directory of the game, directly start the ""Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2"" to enter the game.
The play experience in the game stand -alone is not excellent. AI teammates are miserable, and the enemy will gather fire to you.

"The style of the game is on point with satisfying gameplay, but it has some GLARING issues. I'd recommend it, but I hope it gets some polish soon!

Pros:
Style: The feel of the 40k universe is really hit on the head. This alone has probably gotten me through the game. I just really adore it.
Audio: Crunchy sound design is very satisfying.
Weapons: The gear you use feels pretty good, the design is limited, but it's loyal to the universe.
Gameplay: Fairly rhythmic fighting with parries, counters & dodges.
Big enemies: Boss fights can be tough ( Angel of Death difficulty ), but typically manageable ( caveat below ).
Story: The story is a bit shallow, but good enough.

Cons:
The most glaring issue is ally AI. It's horrendous, pathetically bad. This can make some boss fights an absolute slog when you're trying to balance yourself to proceed through the fight. It also destroys immersion seeing an Astartes knuckle f***ing himself in the corner while you're fighting for your life.
Hit boxes: The hit boxes are bad. You'll get hit at bizarre ranges & you'll often shoot invisible walls when attacking enemies. I've also been struck countless times through cover from ranged attacks.
Homing Melee Attacks: One the most annoying things in this game is enemies leaping at you ( not talking about parry counters ) & having them turn in the air or have them YA YEET themselves after you when you dodge.
Stun Lock: Though I understand it's a swarm hitting you & that's sort of the point, getting stun locked is just a poor choice. No one likes stun lock. No one likes losing control of their character. No one wants to have 2/3 of their health gone from 3 gaunts.

Edit:

Tacked on Feature: After finally playing the PvP I gotta' say it's pretty dog-sh*t. The fact that you have to re-level up just to use weapons is a very brain-dead decision. It's artificial play time that should not exist in a game where PvP feels like a tack-on to begin with. Being dumped into games where the majority of my team is > Level 10 & the opponents are < Level 20 is laughable. Less options, less-powerful gear ( in some aspects ) & less experience vs a team higher in all regards. Trashy.","游戏的风格具有令人满意的游戏玩法，但是它有一些明显的问题。我会推荐它，但我希望它能尽快获得抛光剂！

优点：
风格：40k宇宙的感觉确实被打在头上。仅此一项就可以让我整个游戏。我真的很喜欢它。
音频：松脆的声音设计非常令人满意。
武器：您使用的装备感觉很好，设计有限，但忠于宇宙。
游戏玩法：与Parries，Counters＆Dodges进行相当有节奏的战斗。
大敌人：老板打架可能很艰难（死亡困难的天使），但通常可以控制（下面有警告）。
故事：这个故事有点浅，但足够好。

缺点：
最明显的问题是Ally AI。这是可怕的，可悲的。当您试图平衡自己进行战斗时，这可能会使一些老板打架。这也破坏了沉浸式的，看到在为自己的生命而战时，一个astartes的指关节在角落里。
命中框：命中框很差。您将在奇异的范围内受到打击，攻击敌人时经常会射击隐形的墙壁。通过远程攻击的掩护，我也被无数次打击。
近战攻击：这个游戏中最烦人的事情之一是敌人跳到你身上（不谈论帕里柜台）并让他们朝着空中旋转，或者当你躲闪时让他们自己之后。
Stun Lock：尽管我知道这是一群击中您，但这是一个重点，但锁住锁定只是一个糟糕的选择。没有人喜欢Stun Lock。没有人喜欢失去对角色的控制。没有人愿意使他们的健康中的2/3从3个手套中消失。

编辑：

涉及功能：终于扮演PvP之后，我必须说这很漂亮。您必须重新升级仅使用武器这一事实是一个非常脑大的决定。这是人工游戏时间，不应该在PVP感觉像是一开始就开始的游戏。被倾倒到我的大多数球队> 10级的游戏中，对手是<20级是可笑的。更少的选择，功能较小的装备（在某些方面）以及在所有方面都更高的经验。垃圾。",-0.9977,"{'Nickname': 'DanWardog', 'Title': '1', 'Play Hours': '141.1', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994343052/', 'Comment': ""The style of the game is on point with satisfying gameplay, but it has some GLARING issues.

"In the game that I expected in 24 years, the parasites like the parasites, so I was like Genomov.
Forced the third party party.
Omnicia eagerly praying to get off Epic and the head of Natus in the head.

Even if you try the tutorial, it's a lot of fun and fun for 40K fans.
Although the developer is different, you can feel that it has been developed for the fun of the previous work.

However, as mentioned above, except for some game problems that are lacking or unfortunate
The initiative pick catches the ankle of the game.
Even the same as in the local army,
There are a lot of people who are cut in the entrance thanks to the pick -up system like dog disease.
Incompetent and greedy, so many idiots Epic
Currently, 9.5 out of 10 non -thousand evaluations of the game is due to Epic.
Even if it wasn't just a pick, if the 40K IP's works were not those who didn't like it from the beginning,
More players (buyers) and evaluations would have been more

Because of dependence, the entrance cut or just attach the Epic Pak like me
People who don't like Epic so much that they can even come to a game of very favorite Warhammer IP

Above all, Saber Interactive and Picks
I needed a pick to run the game, but I didn't listen to it anywhere.
EGS EULA's unique peculiarity is a problem that is disadvantageous to all of the peculiar pikes
The game is executed only if you agree with the fucking terms of fucking picks that cannot be done.

Like the EDF6, these dirty picks are
As if the cancer spreads to your body, it will continue to bold the disgusting gestures.
Then, by the time Epic realized that it was a pick
There is a situation that becomes natural
Even in the local army
Netizes or chancho -chan, because they are the same cubs


--- After the October 17 patch ---
Since the previous five -day patch, the difficulty of the overall game has decreased so I thought it would be a bit of a hand.
Personally, it became a very unpleasant game
I think it may be that the damage reduction on the boss of the shameous melmela
You can also understand Ospaxes

In the end, whether Korea or the United States, he's a patch with nerfs as the result of his turn.
This is a real problem.
게임 좆창난다 싶으면 이새끼들은 진작에 도망가고 없는 새끼들인데
Not developers are playing games, but only their daughters and the sucking opinions of the chicks.
Big, we've only picked up unpleasant patches, but now it's just that way

If the distance between the fatal difficulty party is dropped
Armor made a picture that was stuck with a teamwork guide and an argument
Hierophanna, which is sprinkled with a dung board covering one third of the map
Like Elead Horde, which is steamed all the time in the Fat Shark's Fucking Tide series
If you avoid it with the quantity of the overlapping characters and rabies, you will be forced to fall.
It's not that armor is cut off when you're hit, but it's a dog that's not the same as the armor.

So there's nothing updated with Volkite, Dark Angel Bullwalk Skin
Even if you overcome the unpleasantness, not the fun difficulty of fatal difficulty,
There is no new grade of equipment, either Lelik or Master.
A few patterns that can't be unlocked by the cosmetics
Power Sword Skin Just Gis

In the meantime, even if you have the part of the recovery restrictions in the ammunition box
Still, even if the head magnification is still high in the idiot deal, the ware to trample the Warrigari step with a non -stop
Bolters have to shoot 2 or 3 shots in Guns, but they have no choice but to dry up 3 times.
As mentioned above, I made a difficulty, so rather than a variety of choices
Melta and Plasmagan's pick rates are easy to handle Horde.
If you hit Melta and Patan nerf again without the baller's upward,
These bastards are confirmed as they are no different from the Arrowheads.
You have to watch what will happen later
At present, it is an unpleasant nerf that is not an interesting difficulty
In the case of fatal difficulty, the Carrie itself is almost impossible in the case.

即使您尝试了本教程，对于40k粉丝来说，这也很有趣。
尽管开发人员是不同的，但您可以感觉到它是为了娱乐以前的工作而开发的。

但是，如上所述，除了缺乏或不幸的某些游戏问题
倡议的选秀权抓住了游戏的脚踝。
甚至与当地军队一样
得益于狗疾病（如狗病），有很多人在入口处被切入。
无能和贪婪，这么多白痴史诗
目前，在10千次对游戏的评估中，有9.5个是由于史诗般的。
即使这不仅是一个选择，如果40k IP的作品不是从一开始就不喜欢的人，那么
更多的玩家（买家）和评估会更多

由于依赖性，入口切割或像我一样固定史诗
不喜欢史诗的人甚至可以参加一个非常喜欢的战锤IP的游戏

最重要的是，Saber互动和选择
我需要一个选秀权来运行游戏，但是我在任何地方都没有听。
例如，尤拉（Egs Eula）独特的特殊性是一个对所有特殊派克的不利的问题
仅当您同意无法完成的他妈的挑选的术语时，该游戏才会执行。

像EDF6一样，这些肮脏的选择是
好像癌症会蔓延到您的体内，它将继续大胆地使令人恶心的手势大胆。
然后，当史诗意识到这是一个选择时

--- 10月17日补丁---
自从前五天的补丁以来，整个游戏的困难已经下降，所以我认为这有点有些。
就个人而言，它变成了非常不愉快的游戏
我认为可能会减少耻辱梅尔梅拉老板的伤害
您也可以理解OSPAXES

最后，无论是韩国还是美国，他都会与Nerfs在一起。
这是一个真正的问题。
게임게임싶으면이새끼들은도망가고없는없는
不是开发人员在玩游戏，而是他们的女儿和小鸡的吮吸观点。
大，我们只拿起令人不愉快的补丁，但是现在就是这样

如果致命的困难党之间的距离被丢弃
盔甲拍摄了一张被团队合作指南和争论所困扰的照片
Hierophanna，撒上粪便，覆盖了地图的三分之一
就像Elead Horde一样，在Fat Shark的他妈的潮汐系列中一直在蒸
如果您避免使用重叠的角色和狂犬病的数量，您将被迫跌倒。
并不是说当您被击中时，盔甲被切断了，而是一只狗与盔甲不同。

因此，Volkite，Dark Angel Bullwalk皮肤没有任何更新
即使您克服了不愉快，而不是致命困难的有趣困难，
Lelik或Master没有新的设备等级。
化妆品无法解锁的几种模式
动力剑皮只有GIS

同时，即使您在弹药框中有恢复限制的一部分
尽管如此，即使白痴交易中的头部放大倍数仍然很高，但warrigari步骤践踏的商品也不停滞不前
螺栓器必须在枪支中拍摄2或3枪，但他们别无选择，只能干燥3次。
如上所述，我遇到了困难，所以不是多种选择
Melta和Plasmagan的选择率很容易处理。
如果您在没有舞者的情况下再次击中Melta和Patan Nerf，
这些混蛋被确认，因为它们与箭头没有什么不同。
您必须观看以后会发生什么

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – A Brutal War in the Grim Darkness of the Future! (ฅ'ω'ฅ)

""An exhilarating, gory, and action-packed sequel that lives up to the scale of the Warhammer 40K universe, but with some notable flaws in balance and technical polish.""


Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 thrusts players into the brutal and unrelenting world of the Warhammer 40K universe, continuing the tale of the Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. Developed by Saber Interactive, this third-person action game places you in the superhuman armor of a Space Marine as you combat the horrifying Tyranid swarm in intense, blood-soaked battles. Building on the success of its predecessor, Space Marine 2 offers solo and co-op gameplay, featuring both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes to keep the action fresh and chaotic.


The moment you step into Titus' power armor, the scale of Space Marine 2’s combat becomes apparent. The game’s standout feature is its seamless combination of gunplay and melee combat, allowing players to switch between devastating bolter shots and brutal close-quarters executions. The spectacle of mowing down endless Tyranid swarms is both thrilling and terrifying, thanks to the sheer number of enemies onscreen, powered by Saber’s Swarm Engine.

The visuals are equally impressive, capturing the grim, gothic aesthetic of the 40K universe. From the ruined hive cities to the expansive battlefields littered with the corpses of xenos and humans alike, the game never shies away from its dark atmosphere. The orchestral score and guttural sounds of bolters firing and chainswords revving heighten the sense of chaos, making every battle feel cinematic.

However, the combat system, while exhilarating, does suffer from balance issues. Melee attacks dominate the battlefield, often making ranged weapons feel underpowered, particularly when faced with larger enemies. The tactical depth you'd expect from wielding the mighty bolter or plasma gun is somewhat diminished by their lack of punch, especially when it inexplicably takes a full magazine to down a basic Tyranid warrior. This can lead to frustrating moments, especially for players who prefer a ranged combat style.

The co-op and PvP modes are a welcome addition, extending the game’s replayability. Operations, the co-op missions, allow players to team up with friends to tackle harder challenges, but the real test comes in the PvP mode, Eternal War, where teams of Space Marines face off against the forces of Chaos. Both modes offer progression systems with plenty of unlockable perks and cosmetics, though the limited variety in mission design can make long play sessions feel repetitive.













Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers on its promise of fast, bloody, and exhilarating combat in the vast and unforgiving Warhammer 40K universe. The game’s atmospheric design, gripping story, and expansive multiplayer modes make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and action games alike. However, the imbalance between melee and ranged combat, along with some technical glitches, prevent it from reaching its full potential.

For those who love diving into the lore of Warhammer or who are looking for a gory, action-packed co-op experience, Space Marine 2 is a solid recommendation. Just don’t expect a perfectly polished experience or to rely heavily on your bolter.

战锤40,000：太空海洋2  - 一场未来严峻的黑暗中的残酷战争！（ฅ'ω'ฅ）

“一个令人振奋的，血腥和动感十足的续集，符合《战锤40k宇宙》的规模，但有一些显着的缺陷，平衡和技术上涨。”


战锤40,000：太空海军陆战队2将球员刺入战锤40k宇宙的残酷而谦虚的世界，继续了乌尔马林队长德米特里·泰特斯（Demetrian Titus）的故事。这款第三人称动作游戏由Saber Interactive开发，将您置于太空海军陆战队的超人盔甲中，当时您与令人恐惧的猛烈的霸王蜂拥而至。Space Marine 2以其前身的成功为基础，提供独奏和合作游戏，以玩家 - 环境（PVE）和玩家 - 播放器（PVP）模式为特色，以保持动作新鲜和混乱。


当您踏入泰特斯（Titus）的动力装甲的那一刻，太空海军2战斗的规模就变得显而易见。游戏的杰出功能是其枪战和近战战斗的无缝组合，使玩家可以在毁灭性的螺栓射击和残酷的近距离执行中切换。割草的奇观既令人震惊又令人恐惧，这要归功于屏幕上的敌人数量的数量，由Saber的Swarm Engine提供支持。

视觉效果同样令人印象深刻，捕捉了40k宇宙的严峻，哥特式美学。从被毁坏的蜂巢城市到散布着Xenos and hommans尸体的广阔战场，游戏永远不会摆脱其黑暗的气氛。抛光射击和链剑的管弦乐乐谱和胆量的声音增强了混乱的感觉，使每场战斗都让人感到电影。

但是，战斗系统虽然令人振奋，但确实遭受了平衡问题的困扰。近战攻击占据了战场的主导地位，经常使远程武器感觉不足，尤其是面对大型敌人时。您所期望的挥舞着强大的螺栓或等离子枪所期望的战术深度有所减少，尤其是当它莫名其妙地带走了一本完整的杂志来击败基本的霸王龙战士时。这可能会导致令人沮丧的时刻，尤其是对于喜欢战斗风格的球员而言。

合作社和PVP模式是可喜的补充，可扩展游戏的可重播性。运营，合作社任务，允许玩家与朋友合作解决更严格的挑战，但是真正的测试是在PVP模式的永恒战争中，太空海军陆战队的团队与混乱的力量对抗。两种模式都提供具有大量可解锁的特权和化妆品的进度系统，尽管任务设计的有限品种可以使长期播放会议变得重复。













战锤40,000：太空海洋2在广阔而不受欢迎的战锤40k宇宙中兑现了快速，血腥和令人振奋的战斗的承诺。该游戏的大气设计，令人着迷的故事和广阔的多人游戏模式使其成为特许经营和动作游戏的粉丝所必需的。但是，近战与远程战斗之间的不平衡以及一些技术故障，阻止了它的全部潜力。

对于那些喜欢潜入战锤的传说或正在寻找血腥，动感十足的合作经验的人来说，太空海军陆战队2是一个可靠的建议。只是不要期望获得完美的体验，也不要严重依赖您的螺栓固定。

"The review is in early access version 0.3V

At the moment, 6 hours only in the plot company of the game.
I play a couple with a friend all the time after the prologue.
But even the game in the company did not save the game ...
I will update the review as the content is developed, but for now:
1) The combat system even from the fact that it is stated very little variability and content has the number of firearms/Combo attacks,
And add to this that of the 5th automatic differences there are no facts.
Just like the combo, it is not felt as a special feeling that except PKM/PKM/PKM is not needed.
And the “nodes” that should form the nucleus of the variety is not enough, and that there is even less, because it makes no sense even purely from “I want” just a 2 -or machine gun 3 or machine gun 3, well, there are no differences in sensations.
In the prologue, the game teaches you to parry and dodge you as well as the solo of the solo of the target, but then the game will throw in crowds throwing all enemies at you without analysis without trying to create interesting situations from different types of enemies in 88%of cases, only I remembered.The location where we hid behind the destroyed statues fired from snipers, this is the only interesting situation for 6 hours of the plot (did not pass and played)
Types of enemies only 5 and 2 bosses and so 5 hours before the appearance of chaosites, which, in fact, RESKINA, the only difference between the chaosites is that the big mobs of chaos (cosmodesant chaos) are able to teleport, otherwise they are identical to their analogues among tyranides.
As a result, the mission is a series of 1 -shaped porridge of 5 types of enemies sometimes 1 out of 2 bosses appear.

Listing trifles regarding the shortcomings of the combat system can not be enough for a review for a long time.

2) the plot is as if there is no Titus, all the characters besides the Titus of a dummy of neither a character nor a person, no interesting dialogues or kitszen, chemistry between ordinary and title in the 1st part when they argued on Astartes Code more than chemistry between Titus and all characters2ki taken together, and this is not hyperbole, just in this scene in 1 chemistry there was a conflict that laid the foundation of the plot, and in 2 there simply no plot or dialogues of any interest in the narrative, drama is not familiar to the developers of the game from the word completely.
Even when there were times when you expect the most logical paths in the framework of the situation, they were not.
It seems that the whole plot wrote and directed the neural network, and once again it is not hyperbole, this is 1 in 1 so.

3) I have the optimization of iron above the recommended, I am not a stab me, I am not a graphodr () I put it on low schedule.I have 2070Super/i5 9600/16ram 3200. And at the same time, I have FPS stably jumps from 40 to 60, and I understand those scenes where a large location is a bunch of enemies and allies, but why does the FPS fall in corridor locations?On low.
Low, my iron 4 years ago was the forerunner Consider especially Vidyakh, and here the game that does not stand out at low ones falls into the FPS, and in some places the Federal Penitentiary Service fell up to 16 Tsati, I'm afraid to imagine what kind of slide show on minimal specified requirements.

I still have a lot to say but not fit in the review, but I voiced the main claims.

If you are far from wahi and you do not care about the canon, for you this is just a casual bad game with low variability and a yawn plot.

If you are assigned a 20 -year -old exposure like me, who has at least 200 hours of podcasts listened and reading/codes, it will hurt you from nonsense on the backing.

And if you are a hired expert Back, take care of your heart, I'm afraid to imagine how it hurts you.

Do not buy a game for a full price tag, you do not miss anything without playing it, you should not take this game for less than 75%of the OV, although even so it is not worth money, it is better to go on import substitution.

And I will continue to play to create a video of the review, I will suffer for you ... PAMAGE Q ... Q ... Q ...","该评论是在早期访问版本0.3V中

目前，仅在游戏的情节公司中6个小时。
序言之后，我一直和一个朋友一起玩。
但是，即使是公司中的游戏也没有保存游戏...
随着内容的开发，我将更新评论，但现在：
1）战斗系统即使从陈述的变化很小，内容的数量很少，因此枪支/组合攻击的数量，
再加上第五自动差异的事实，没有事实。
就像组合一样，除了不需要PKM/PKM/PKM之外，这并不是一种特殊的感觉。
而且应该构成品种核的“节点”是不够的，甚至还不够，感觉没有差异。
在序言中，游戏会教会您在目标的独奏中擦拭和躲避您，但是随后，游戏将在没有分析的情况下向您投掷所有敌人，而无需试图从不同类型的情况下创造有趣的情况我只记得88％的案件中的敌人。我们藏在狙击手被击落的雕像后面的地方，这是情节6个小时的唯一有趣的情况（没有通过并玩耍）
敌人的类型只有5和2个老板，所以在混合物出现之前的5小时，实际上，这是Chaosite之间的唯一区别是，混乱的大暴民（Cosmodesmodesant Chaos）能够传达，否则它们是与泰兰尼德的类似物相同。
结果，该任务是一系列1种形状的粥，其中有5种敌人有时会出现2个老板中的1个。

关于战斗系统的缺点的列表琐事不足以在很长一段时间内进行审查。

2）情节好像没有titus，除了一个既不是角色也不是人的假人的titus之外，所有字符，都没有有趣的对话或kitszen，当他们在Astartes代码上争论时，普通和标题之间的化学反应，在第一部分中的化学反应不仅仅是Titus和所有角色2KI之间的化学反应，这并不是夸张的，只是在1个化学的场景中，有一场冲突奠定了情节的基础，而在2中，没有任何兴趣的情节或对话。叙事，戏剧并不熟悉游戏的开发人员。
即使有时候您期望情况框架中最合乎逻辑的路径，它们也不是。
似乎整个情节都写了并指导了神经网络，这再次不是夸张，这是1分之一。

3）我对铁的优化优化，我不是刺我，我不是graphodr（）我的时间表很低。我有2070 super/i5 9600/16ram 3200。与此同时。FPS是否稳定地从40跳到60，我理解那些位置很大的场景是一堆敌人和盟友，但是为什么FPS落入走廊位置？
低，我4年前我的铁是尤其是vidyakh的先驱，在这里，在低矮的游戏中，该游戏落入了FPS，在某些地方，联邦监狱服务跌至16 tsati，我怕我害怕想象一下，关于最小的指定要求，哪种幻灯片显示。

我还有很多话要说，但不适合评论，但我表达了主要主张。

如果您离Wahi很远，并且不在乎佳能，那么这只是一个休闲的坏游戏，可变性较低，打哈欠剧情。

如果您像我一样被分配了20年的曝光，他们至少有200个小时的播客听和阅读/代码，这将使您在背景方面的胡说八道受到伤害。

而且，如果您是雇用的专家，请照顾您的心脏，我害怕想象它会如何伤害您。

不要购买全价标签的游戏​​，如果不玩的情况，您不会错过任何东西，您不应该以少于OV的75％的75％进行游戏，尽管即使如此不值得，也最好继续进口替代。

我将继续演奏以创建评论的视频，我会为您痛苦... pamage q ... q ... q ... q ...",-0.9972,"{'Nickname': 'SiMBi0ZZA', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '14.3', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/id/SiMBi0ZZA/', 'Comment': ""The review is in early access version 0.3V\n\nAt the moment, 6 hours only in the plot company of the game.\nI play a couple with a friend all the time after the prologue.\nBut even the game in the company did not save the game ...\nI will update the review as the content is developed, but for now:\n1) The combat system even from the fact that it is stated very little variability and content has the number of firearms/Combo attacks,\nAnd add to this that of the 5th automatic differences there are no facts.\nJust like the combo, it is not felt as a special feeling that except PKM/PKM/PKM is not needed.\nAnd the “nodes” that should form the nucleus of the variety is not enough, and that there is even less, because it makes no sense even purely from “I want” just a 2 -or machine gun 3 or machine gun 3, well, there are no differences in sensations.\nIn the prologue, the game teaches you to parry and dodge you as well as the solo of the solo of the target, but then the game will throw in crowds throwing all enemies at you without analysis without trying to create interesting situations from different types of enemies in 88%of cases, only I remembered.The location where we hid behind the destroyed statues fired from snipers, this is the only interesting situation for 6 hours of the plot (did not pass and played)\nTypes of enemies only 5 and 2 bosses and so 5 hours before the appearance of chaosites, which, in fact, RESKINA, the only difference between the chaosites is that the big mobs of chaos (cosmodesant chaos) are able to teleport, otherwise they are identical to their analogues among tyranides.\nAs a result, the mission is a series of 1 -shaped porridge of 5 types of enemies sometimes 1 out of 2 bosses appear.\n\nListing trifles regarding the shortcomings of the combat system can not be enough for a review for a long time.\n\n2) the plot is as if there is no Titus, all the characters besides the Titus of a dummy of neither a character nor a person, no interesting dialogues or kitszen, chemistry between ordinary and title in the 1st part when they argued on Astartes Code more than chemistry between Titus and all characters2ki taken together, and this is not hyperbole, just in this scene in 1 chemistry there was a conflict that laid the foundation of the plot, and in 2 there simply no plot or dialogues of any interest in the narrative, drama is not familiar to the developers of the game from the word completely.\nEven when there were times when you expect the most logical paths in the framework of the situation, they were not.\nIt seems that the whole plot wrote and directed the neural network, and once again it is not hyperbole, this is 1 in 1 so.\n\n3) I have the optimization of iron above the recommended, I am not a stab me, I am not a graphodr () I put it on low schedule.I have 2070Super/i5 9600/16ram 3200.

The cheap fighting brother feelings, the brothers Guishan also has it, and the ICU war god has also exceeded the difficulties. You can’t find a better hammer game than this on the market, but this is also a hammer approval.The happiest and saddest point.

Next, let's deduct points
The only special martial arts or wolf cubs from the family's hair from the home of the Killing Team from the beginning of the killing team originally thought that after being the original P Starmer's warrior, I could give me the whole point of atonement and expected the technology and ruthlessness that I haven't seen in 100 years.Live, then turn on the weapon library to see the slow firing speed shotgun, fast shooting shotgun, big magazine burst shotgun, mirror explosion shotgun, three -point shooting shotgun and bomb -preparation very few shotgunsEssence
Well, after finishing the plot, the motion mode is realized that those humorous shotguns are all used for funny original P toys. The entire game can be used in two guns, which are hot melt and multi -tube hot melt without bringing with hot melt without bringing with hot melt without bringing it with it.The hot -melt original P was drowned in the shit of the nest's waterway. This is the self -confidence given by the original P weapon library, Kiliman!Dola!Where is my ammunition?IntersectionWhat about I built a gun?What about my gravity cannon?
But in the most poke, I laugh at the skill tree that directly copys the dark tide. How can I even copy the halo of the humorous mosquito legs of the soldiers?However, the four thieves next door facing the tide of the corpse tide without injuries, the blood was full of blood, and the grenade was brushed, and the three original P brush waves and worms here were sweaty.The red -letter warrior on the face with the murderer team with the murderer sacred beetle terminator or even rolled directly into the eaves and turned into a marathon.Essence
Say a joke: ""Death is my skill"" (he really said this)
For a little bit, for this set of humorous skill trees and weapon development systems, we must make the first six pictures of the first shot of the liver.After the epic game experience of the Blood Crazy Tyrannosaurus King, I finally couldn't help laughing and became a fool.
As a game that wants to operate for a long time, the stacking is necessary, and some of his campaign stacking can be regarded as qualified, and the cooperation mode as the core of the game and the battle mode that has been given by the Wind Moon Film War Troupe,He is unqualified. At this stage, there are too little and too few. He only hopes that you should not pay tribute to the legendary operation in the long -term operation.

Finally, the Space Chaoxiong has also ushered in its own free upgrade. It is difficult to mention the difficulty. The enemy's strength and wave frequency are super enhanced.

Even if it is, add a brotherhood system copied from the dark tide, and the fighting brothers must approach each other to return to the armor!And I turned over the 10th version of CODEX without seeing where I wrote that there were no fighting brothers around the super -warrior.As a jail, you see a group of weirds rushing towards you. If you can hold back and not jump up and smash the floor, you have already surpassed 90%of adolescent sports, and in this difficulty 5, you flew out by yourself alone.It means that you will become a waste that cannot be returned to armor.

This game is for the chickens, the ghosts of the chickens, the ghost of the cloud hammer, the sixth edition of the old, the shareholder of THQ, the great good, the original P enthusiast of the tactical, the Space Spirit Romans, use the chain to see the sword ASMR as the abnormal side dish of the side dishesSexuality, the second empire citizen, cannot be forgiven, specially shot the masters of Carga skirts, Titus poison, Kiliman Dream Girl, Alfrais and the King of Zhenqi True Fans, fans of this work,The service is really done. The cheap fighting brother feelings, the brothers Guishan also has it, and the ICU war god has also exceeded the difficulties. You can’t find a better hammer game than this on the market, but this is also a hammer approval.The happiest and saddest point.
———————————————————————————————————————————
Next, let's deduct points
The only special martial arts or wolf cubs from the family's hair from the home of the Killing Team from the beginning of the killing team originally thought that after being the original P Starmer's warrior, I could give me the whole point of atonement and expected the technology and ruthlessness that I haven't seen in 100 years.Live, then turn on the weapon library to see the slow firing speed shotgun, fast shooting shotgun, big magazine burst shotgun, mirror explosion shotgun, three -point shooting shotgun and bomb -preparation very few shotgunsEssence
Well, after finishing the plot, the motion mode is realized that those humorous shotguns are all used for funny original P toys. The entire game can be used in two guns, which are hot melt and multi -tube hot melt without bringing with hot melt without bringing with hot melt without bringing it with it.The hot -melt original P was drowned in the shit of the nest's waterway. This is the self -confidence given by the original P weapon library, Kiliman!Dola!Where is my ammunition?IntersectionWhat about I built a gun?What about my gravity cannon?
But in the most poke, I laugh at the skill tree that directly copys the dark tide. How can I even copy the halo of the humorous mosquito legs of the soldiers?However, the four thieves next door facing the tide of the corpse tide without injuries, the blood was full of blood, and the grenade was brushed, and the three original P brush waves and worms here were sweaty.The red -letter warrior on the face with the murderer team with the murderer sacred beetle terminator or even rolled directly into the eaves and turned into a marathon.Essence
Say a joke: ""Death is my skill"" (he really said this)
For a little bit, for this set of humorous skill trees and weapon development systems, we must make the first six pictures of the first shot of the liver.After the epic game experience of the Blood Crazy Tyrannosaurus King, I finally couldn't help laughing and became a fool.
As a game that wants to operate for a long time, the stacking is necessary, and some of his campaign stacking can be regarded as qualified, and the cooperation mode as the core of the game and the battle mode that has been given by the Wind Moon Film War Troupe,He is unqualified. At this stage, there are too little and too few. He only hopes that you should not pay tribute to the legendary operation in the long -term operation.

"There is no unfortunate thing, but the game that is more than expected


Warhammer IP is a Warhammer Total War, which has been shown as a fantasy worldview compared to the IP name value and fandom size, and in the 40K worldview, the Dunge of War series was once successful, and it is an IP that is steadily mentioned in the game -related suffering.

As a result, the problem -related issues of the Games Workshop (typically only nuggle from the dark tide)
It was a speculation that is quite often mentioned abroad that it is involved in game development in relation to miniature sales.

Because of that reason, major game companies are reluctant to use the IP
Complex that is overflowing with steam ~ In the midst of a mass production of positive games

It was more concerned than expected when Saber Interactive, who had been evaluated for the development of the game itself with World War Z itself, was considered to be inadequate, and the fact that the post -support and operational ability was good.
The main story of World War Z had a lot of technical issues at the time of launch, and there was no longer than I thought because the content was small before the update was added.

Some of these problems are still in this Space Marine 2, but nevertheless dopamine elements that can overcome this regret are significant in the game.


1. Action production that suits the space marine

The crew has been steadily mentioned since its release that it was inspired by the Gears of War series, and it is actually a cruel and pleasant production and play method that is actually seen in the Gears of War series.This is well matched with Space Marine's character, and it is also suitable for the Warhammer 40K worldview.
In the case of the previous work, the character was so heavy except when using some jump packs, but this time I feel that I have a good feeling that it is a heavy and living weapon.

2. Visual

Unlike the previous one, Space Marine, which was too monotonous, it showed a wider range of backgrounds, providing fun to watch the background all the time, and the design of the Warhammer 40K fans, the design, art style, and the quantity of the world War ZIs excellent overall.
However, the performance is a bit unfortunate.

3. Operation expected in the long run

In the case of the previous World War Z, the main story has been pointed out a lot of problems, but this problem has been improved quite a bit with continuous follow -up, and this Space Marine 2 will be updated for PVE mode, map, and PvP in the long term in the long term.Scheduled.
If they maintain only the post -support they showed in the previous work, they will have a good impact on the long -term life of the game.

4. PVP, which is quite expected

I was able to beta in PvP, so I was smashed even if I was expecting PVP from overseas, but it was surprisingly chosen.It feels a bit different from Arena, Counter Strike, and Valorant, represented by Call of Duty, which is currently occupying the FPS game market.It feels like.The metaro so far is to die if you try to run and gun with ignorance, and it is believed that the team members gather together with 6 vs 6 confrontation depending on the position.However, it is not a feeling that the balance itself is made so much that it is not enough to go in the long run, apart from the nucleus.

5. Lack of current content and mission diversity

However, the disadvantage of the critics' evaluation and the disadvantage of the people who enjoy the absolute content itself is a little less.
The campaign itself has a variation depending on the difficulty level, but you can see the ending for 8 to 12 hours, and only six maps are the main PVE content.And the Horde mode and additional PVE content are scheduled to be updated later, so if the PVE Pai Youth layer, which has been bursting with Helgers 2, is looking for a game that can be replaced, it can be a little disappointed with the lack of content.There are few elements of PVE games and digging, but there are no elements to analyze and challenge except for the difficulty levels.

6. A technical issue that is quietly experienced

The AI ​​is a bit copper, and you can find a bug quite easily when you play, and there are many cases of delay in PvP or PVE if the server is unstable.


Overall, there is still a disadvantage of developers, lack of main contents, and technical issues

Review on September 8th

If you see a friend who commented on my comment, if you are not brain disabled or want or like Thai -Japanese or Smurfs if you are not brain -residual powder or you really want or really want to or like the sacrifice group.


After exiting the game, the more you think about it, the more and more uncomfortable. You say that I am a pure hammer Xiaobai. Even if I don't care so much, I don’t care about it.But at least I have liked this subject from the War Dawn 1, so I will care about some settings that have been moving to the game in the game.

The interstellar warrior here is a new one, right? The original Star Warrior should be higher, stronger, stronger, and faster than the first generation of this game. In addition to the picture, what do you think have changed?Well, I think in this game, the performance has become weakened. After the casting of Thai and Japan, the ""Blessing of Blood God"" will not be executed and the blood will become poor.Three times that of Beef is really three times and the energy of the armor 1 generation may be 5 times the speed of this.It's not the samurai that is not the samurai, but you only need 2. So how much do you see the knife and insects in the game? Sorry, I did n’t count anyway anyway.Of course, your operation is not blocked directly to the street

Okay, then our new Star Warrior power, what do you say? Should I take that difficulty 4 level? Okay anyway, you don’t have the bad cans of Magnus's cubs.Quickly solve a bad canned food, which is likely to be resolved by him that people can kill you in seconds and you may not be able to take him in seconds.

Then let's take a look at the military weapons prepared by Dorakle for everyone?Um, in the case of almost difficulty in various explosives and weapons 4, in addition to those specialized headshots, the remaining remaining are all abandoned and miscellaneous goals.It may not be done after two elites that may not be done, even one may not be done because the other party is also moving you, but the spiritual flames that may be blasted on the opposite side can make you a pink powder. Is this a new weapon? Is this a new weapon?Why is the difference between the differences in the official books I read? I think it ’s not as good as that of the first generation. These guns even do I even think that the production team has never seen the weapon setting of the warhammer?When I used a hot -melt gun, I concluded that the production team only looked at the picture. The hot -melt cleaning of the miscellaneous soldiers listened to such a thing.Well, but ah, but have you seen a samurai, can you eat 5 rounds of hot face?Um can eat 7 ~ 9 rounds ... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Then ah the hot -melt bomb. This stuff is very powerful and you can only bring one of these after picking up. This is not a problem. This thing. You can only put it down in place.It is impossible for you to even throw a hot -melt bomb. This hot melt is heavier than the biological crustal on the back of the dumplings ~~ Anyway, the biological crust on the back is shot to the one hand. I can't understand it.These new interstellar warriors

Then the so -called original casting equipment is modularized. Um in this game, you have become a career.Equipped to armed into a specific type of interstellar warrior instead of a professional production team should go to see the official settings and then become a profession, which causes many weapons to become fixed.Use bandit and then heavy rifle. Only the so -called tactical Star Warriors can use it. Haha ... I want to sayIn the pioneer, what weapon he took in his hand?Do you dare to tell me the production team?Don't know?That is obviously a heavy -duty explosion rifle installed with fireproofer ~~~ Know, everyone said that the production team did not play the pioneer in the original star -like modular performance game.GM's melee weapon has also been fixedly fixed with our tactical Star Warrior to bring a full set. Sorry, I don’t like the Shield Guard.

I don’t want to say a few chicken ribs, and some of them are some of the chicken ribs.

Then there is a sacred thing in the game. You can pick up and take it after you fall to the ground. You can get up such a funny thing after falling to the ground. We use the original Star Fighter.Bellyza
In a good actual game, we have no functions of this stove. I want to fan you, you read, okay?
It's okay to see the rules ~~~ I don’t know what is the Bellysa Storo.

Then continue to vomit, it is not as good as the first generation and the first generation. You can make the enemy under the loss of the enemy through the melee weapon.The enemy who was originally there was still the enemy that was refreshed later.Flash red can execute the brushed strange tide mobs, you can only set off a shooting execution after flying at most, and this shooting execution may be interrupted or you use it in the center of the strange tide.Frames, but the enemy has been stinging for you when you execute it, you are lucky, and you will die directly, and the shooting is executed at most back to one grid. I said that you are crispy as a paper 1 grid.

What do you say after playing overall? It is difficult to say that the production level of European and American games is really average

I was looking forward to it at first and after reading the leak version, I looked forward to it.

The first is the problem of EPIC. I also installed that thing but I didn’t be updated by anything or I would not download it.Very easy to turn equal to no

Next, the game content optimization was very slow at first, and then the CG result of the first paragraph of the game actually stuck the problem or loaded the problem anyway.There is no special problem when it is smooth

Then there is the feeling of feel and the difference between the first generation. First of all, you have no execution of the blood combat. The execution of the pistol will be interrupted anyway. I have been interrupted.It's all from a key pair, that is, your mouse. You can quickly lightly press and stabilize. It is a hit. This causes you to contact me with melee. Sometimes it is not flexible.at this point

Then the problem of executing is that the pistol counterattack is that you can escape or block the successful block that can trigger a shooting counterattack some elite enemies can be twice and then the miscellaneous soldiers are basically the block.It is a shot to get a shooting execution, but this shooting execution is embarrassing. Sometimes when is it embarrassing? It must be the end of your current action when you are in the enemy group.You can force the action to enter the execution. This will cause you a trigger button that you have already shot the enemy and the enemy that has appeared in a melee hit.Just shift the position or the enemy is beyond the range or directly determine that it fails to trigger, which causes you to be beaten by the strange operation.

In other words, the remote execution and your movements have a problem with your movement. If you can directly make an image, you can immediately interrupt the current action.


Next is the online mode part of the PVE. You did n’t customize the picture given you the picture. It seems that there is only one to play a total of 6 pictures and then play a game anyway.The liver's weapon requires material anyway, I didn’t see it anyway, just right, it may not give you the experience of the 0 Legion Skin, you can get the experience that you can get the customs clearance to unlock it, but the elite installation must clear the specific requirements. For exampleAh

In general, it may be that except for the customs and the characteristics of the skin and the characteristics of the weapon.The key to hit the button is not as good as the first generation of the first generation.

I just want to say that I have n’t intended to play on September 9th on September 9th. If you are not hammered, my suggestion is a refund war hammer 40K game. This one can only be regarded as mediocre.Dark Horse But it seems that this game can be played, but it is not necessarily more fun. Friends who have thought about the plot. I suggest that if you are discounted, it is estimated that it will be discounted for about half a year.Just buy the game","It is said that it has enhanced the explosive weapon but there is no effect at all, without any salary of the water car, without the salary of the water car, do not want to use the explosive weapon melee and scrape it. If you are running on the Star Warrior, please do n’t buy this game.The emperor's half god is just a elite head, even if it is not as good as Kaishe or loyal soldiers.

This update began to learn from the arrow this time. The last update is very good.Weaken the so -called enhancement melee is nonsense. You will be non -reasonable. You will be judged to cut off you unless you enhance the melee to the N4 Elite Monster.Congratulations to the risk of risk producers in any game. Since the second arrow is going to be the second arrow. Congratulations to the number of people who are not as much as you are.

Review on September 8th

If you see a friend who commented on my comment, if you are not brain disabled or want or like Thai -Japanese or Smurfs if you are not brain -residual powder or you really want or really want to or like the sacrifice group.


After exiting the game, the more you think about it, the more and more uncomfortable. You say that I am a pure hammer Xiaobai. Even if I don't care so much, I don’t care about it.But at least I have liked this subject from the War Dawn 1, so I will care about some settings that have been moving to the game in the game.

The interstellar warrior here is a new one, right? The original Star Warrior should be higher, stronger, stronger, and faster than the first generation of this game. In addition to the picture, what do you think have changed?Well, I think in this game, the performance has become weakened. After the casting of Thai and Japan, the ""Blessing of Blood God"" will not be executed and the blood will become poor.Three times that of Beef is really three times and the energy of the armor 1 generation may be 5 times the speed of this.It's not the samurai that is not the samurai, but you only need 2. So how much do you see the knife and insects in the game? Sorry, I did n’t count anyway anyway.Of course, your operation is not blocked directly to the street

Okay, then our new Star Warrior power, what do you say? Should I take that difficulty 4 level? Okay anyway, you don’t have the bad cans of Magnus's cubs.Quickly solve a bad canned food, which is likely to be resolved by him that people can kill you in seconds and you may not be able to take him in seconds.

Then let's take a look at the military weapons prepared by Dorakle for everyone?Um, in the case of almost difficulty in various explosives and weapons 4, in addition to those specialized headshots, the remaining remaining are all abandoned and miscellaneous goals.It may not be done after two elites that may not be done, even one may not be done because the other party is also moving you, but the spiritual flames that may be blasted on the opposite side can make you a pink powder. Is this a new weapon? Is this a new weapon?Why is the difference between the differences in the official books I read? I think it ’s not as good as that of the first generation. These guns even do I even think that the production team has never seen the weapon setting of the warhammer?When I used a hot -melt gun, I concluded that the production team only looked at the picture. The hot -melt cleaning of the miscellaneous soldiers listened to such a thing.Well, but ah, but have you seen a samurai, can you eat 5 rounds of hot face?Um can eat 7 ~ 9 rounds ... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Then ah the hot -melt bomb. This stuff is very powerful and you can only bring one of these after picking up. This is not a problem. This thing. You can only put it down in place.It is impossible for you to even throw a hot -melt bomb. This hot melt is heavier than the biological crustal on the back of the dumplings ~~ Anyway, the biological crust on the back is shot to the one hand. I can't understand it.These new interstellar warriors

Then the so -called original casting equipment is modularized. Um in this game, you have become a career.Equipped to armed into a specific type of interstellar warrior instead of a professional production team should go to see the official settings and then become a profession, which causes many weapons to become fixed.Use bandit and then heavy rifle. Only the so -called tactical Star Warriors can use it. Haha ... I want to sayIn the pioneer, what weapon he took in his hand?Do you dare to tell me the production team?Don't know?That is obviously a heavy -duty explosion rifle installed with fireproofer ~~~ Know, everyone said that the production team did not play the pioneer in the original star -like modular performance game.GM's melee weapon has also been fixedly fixed with our tactical Star Warrior to bring a full set. Sorry, I don’t like the Shield Guard.

I don’t want to say a few chicken ribs, and some of them are some of the chicken ribs.

Then there is a sacred thing in the game. You can pick up and take it after you fall to the ground. You can get up such a funny thing after falling to the ground. We use the original Star Fighter.Bellyza
In a good actual game, we have no functions of this stove. I want to fan you, you read, okay?
It's okay to see the rules ~~~ I don’t know what is the Bellysa Storo.

Then continue to vomit, it is not as good as the first generation and the first generation. You can make the enemy under the loss of the enemy through the melee weapon.The enemy who was originally there was still the enemy that was refreshed later.Flash red can execute the brushed strange tide mobs, you can only set off a shooting execution after flying at most, and this shooting execution may be interrupted or you use it in the center of the strange tide.Frames, but the enemy has been stinging for you when you execute it, you are lucky, and you will die directly, and the shooting is executed at most back to one grid. I said that you are crispy as a paper 1 grid.

In other words, the producer is a set of zombie world wars. If you see a friend who commented on my comment, if you are not brain -residual or want or like Thai and Sky Elite TroupeIt is really recommended to refund and then attach the original surgery three items below

The four or five elites of AI teammates like mentally handicapped.I do n’t know what the teammates are doing for a long time. The strange AI will really do it without shooting the corner called reinforcement to the sky. There are also the leaves and fences chosen by the four gods.Big blood next door is more powerful than this. Ostart is a shotgun of the Astart.

The coin server, the original addition of other people's room loading and interrupt opening the display game, it was normal. As a result, I just opened the task as the homeowner to load to the end to the end of the display task. And your cast coin EAC anti -cheating card special card Green plays is worse than not adding. EAC is really not in the industry. It ’s really not B. It’ s purely a counter -cheat for PVP. It ’s time to open it.

I can query the player, but your shielding feedback has no feedback to press the shield key, and you do not confirm whether the shielding is shielded.Can't do it?

The mentally handicapped multi -person matching system. Entering the room of others. If others retreat, the nickname owner will quickly get stuck into a homeowner. It cannot match into the room of others.What the code is written in? There are many functions that normal multiplayer games should not be said. Even the foundation online is not good.Do you have to jump to next year?As a compulsory connected multiplayer game server maintenance, there is no notice of not a notice and suddenly falls off.

Can you say that no need to change is the risk return. Have you played your own games?Open your mouth, or do you dare to do it if you test?It is also a bug that can be triggered by hot -melt blood recovery. You can also play with players. You can do it. You must have not played your own games.This is this cricket, the mother is dead, it ’s a bit more strange that the B -grid armor is not as fast as it falls. A small bug touched a grid and it’ s gone.Human blood armor is directly cleared, and your broken B gun attack is to control yourself. Except for one or two monsters, you can use your B gun attack when you are in one or two.

Those models can also say that technical problems cannot be achieved. Bull, do you touch the game on the first day?Touch the model code on the first day?Fat Shark can really win numb lying down. It ’s uncomfortable. There is a small number of content. Anti -cheating is a joke. The server is also a pink.The gun can have B at tens of meters away from the flight time and ballistic fall.

Looking at so mostly, most of them have to be a hammer powder that can be played as Astart. At first glance, 41K kills this kind of achievement with 0.2%.The unlocking time of the ordinary version is also 10 days. If you have any questions, you can be a bit B.

"I don't mention the bad aspects, because there are enough comments in this area.

Today I only judge the bad performance of the weapon design in the online PVE.

When a game weapon value fails, it is manifested.There are eight or nine optional weapons, but players have to play one of them.And that's not fun, but not to live without playing.

This game is the same as the Jedi divishes.The game where the game is the most failed in the value of the bullet gun. The player does not care whether the production team has designed a self -moving shotgun (light machine gun) and heavy automatic shotgun (heavy machine gun), but the entire bomb weapon gunThe clan was marked with 'garbage'.

In the face of high difficulty, players will have to be forced to play hot -melt weapons.Who would have thought that the strongest cornerstone on the Empire and the vehicle, there was actually no combos of the combination in the game, and the enemy's defense posture could not be moved.Elite weird chicken ribs?

When the samurai puts a double bone knife and cuts me directly with the dense heavy explosion barrage, I wondered whether I took a heavy burst of the rifle, or the Carterrell laser gun in the Star Army.EssenceYou know, Baoya is a rocket ammunition made by Jingjin. Well gold is not as hard as the bone knife of samurai?Why doesn't it even break the defense posture?

In terms of firearm shooting feel, the 1 -inch heavy bomb design looks like the feel of the .75 burst. The .75 burst feel and the strikes were not even as good as the warhammer 40000: the dark tide thief with the mortal bombs of the army had a sense of strike.All players who come to explode the shotgun will be disappointed, because in this game, the long -range weapons of you and friends when playing, only hot -melt weapons with a very low bullet capacity can help you survive. Choosing explosive guns is choosing to chooseHe died of disappointing the emperor.

Later I would like to talk to the production team to talk about the design of the game mode.

Online PVE, why don't you design an open map, like the Jedi dive 2, smash us with a jumping airdrop compartment to specify the task goal for us, let us complete ourselves?This is not faster than you design linear map updates, more playable?

What classic design of Astart's five -person jumping cockpit, will the production team not allow players to experience track airborne at once?If there is no track airborne.Every time I took the Thunder Eagle Barn, I was an airborne soldier in Astart and even the Star Army.Astart, which has not experienced the crackdown on track airborne, is equipped with Astart?There is no spirit at all!","我没有提及不良方面，因为在这个领域有足够的评论。

今天，我只判断在线PVE中武器设计的不良性能。

当游戏武器价值失败时，它会被体现出来。有八个或九个可选武器，但是玩家必须玩其中之一。这并不有趣，但不要在没有玩耍的情况下生活。

该游戏与绝地武士的划分相同。游戏在子弹枪的价值上是最失败的游戏。玩家不在乎生产团队是否设计了一个自动的shot弹枪（轻机枪）和重型自动shot弹枪（重型机枪），但整个炸弹武器枪支枪支氏族都标有“垃圾”。

面对高度困难，球员将不得不被迫玩热式武器。防御姿势无法移动。

当武士放着双骨刀并用密集的爆炸弹幕直接割伤我时，我想知道我是在星空军中拿起一支猛击的步枪还是卡特雷尔激光枪。由Jingjin。好吧，黄金不如武士的骨头刀坚硬？为什么不打破防御姿势？

在枪支射击感觉方面，1英寸重型炸弹设计看起来像.75爆发的感觉。.75爆发的感觉和罢工甚至不如战锤40000：军队的致命炸弹的黑暗潮汐小偷具有罢工感。所有来爆炸的球员都会让人失望，因为在此中，游戏，您和朋友在玩游戏时的长距离武器，只有大弹能的热融化武器可以帮助您生存。选择爆炸性枪支是选择选择他死于失望的皇帝。

后来，我想与生产团队谈谈游戏模式的设计。

在线pve，为什么不设计一个开放地图，例如《绝地潜水2》，用跳跃的空调箱砸我们以指定我们的任务目标，让我们完成自己的任务？这不是您设计线性地图更新的速度，更可玩？

Astart的五人跳跃驾驶舱的经典设计，制作团队会不允许玩家一次体验空中轨道吗？星空军。",-0.9957,"{'Nickname': 'Chevalier Landirose', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '66.6', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198259262073/', 'Comment': ""I don't mention the bad aspects, because there are enough comments in this area.\n\nToday I only judge the bad performance of the weapon design in the online PVE.\n\nWhen a game weapon value fails, it is manifested.There are eight or nine optional weapons, but players have to play one of them.And that's not fun, but not to live without playing.\n\nThis game is the same as the Jedi divishes.The game where the game is the most failed in the value of the bullet gun.

"Campaign:
Great Cinematic experience, better with friends, very cool.
Only low point I can think of are the ""Rats"" section of the 2nd mission and some downtime sections from the ""Cave"" mission.

PvP:
It's ok, a bit death-bally and significantly less emphasis on Melee in my short experience with it.
I didn't have much interest in it before and quickly lost interest in it, so I haven't played a lot of rounds nor grind each classes to unlock their other, more interesting weapons.

(Co-)Operations:

Patch 3.0 (2024/09/26) update:

Armor attrition vs Minoris is better which made the melee combat survivability less punishing or gunstrike reliant. Adjusted spawns for the Chaos faction nerfs made it less overwhelming.

Overall an improvement to the push forward combat that plays better and makes you feel more like a Space Marine, but also makes the game easier (which I think is alright as they will add new enemies and difficulty tier).

They also fixed the bugs with the Supply pod full healing characters with +20% max HP passive/ perk and healing past contested health bug with Melta/ Las Fusil/ etc. which is good.

Original Launch review:

Only having 6 missions on launch is terrible, -Tide games and World War Z had more on launch in the past and still needed more content.

Balance seemed all over the place.
At the higher difficulties, there are fewer resources, it felt similar to the tactical survival experience of Back 4 Blood and World War Z. Depending on your build, you want to be thrifty with ammo and to save it for a wave/ Terminus miniboss/ or an enemy calling for reinforcements from an out of reach place.

Enemies becomes bullet spongy at higher difficulties and are more numerous, and Medicae Stims heals less HP. Different weapon types seem to have different effectiveness vs specific enemies. Running away to the next airlock/ elevator to despawn enemies behind you is cheesy and effective, but not fun.

You have to ration your ammo in-between fixed ammo crate placements and try to use melee, the environment, and equipment you find as optimally as possible (explosive barrels, explosive flowers, and level gimmicks such as the fire wall at the end of the first mission or the train diverter control panel in the last mission).

Regardless of the difficulty, missions have RNG aspects to it such as the mid-level events requiring 0-6 (!) sub-objectives to complete.

Perk and class balance seemed to be all over the place, but I need to play more to be sure, and there seems to be some bugs or hidden effects.
Examples for balance stuff:
- Certain classes have ammo generation perks later on in their class (or weapon perk line) which seems to be a mandatory pick compared to the other options;
- Bulwark's 23 perk restores contested health to your max HP which substantially reduces the need for healing items when paired with executions, or allowing full heal + wound restoration when paired with a Medicae Stim.

Also you use the same currency to buy weapons, class perks, and Space Marine Chapter Customization and you always feel poor while progressing initially, with some classes having more expensive weapons (e.g. Assault).

You also need to grind each class and weapons types. You can max out a class to level 25 and still need to level other weapon types, but trying to do it in the higher difficulty sucks because your lower tier weapon is weak, negatively affecting the strength of the team and your character.","活动：
很棒的电影经验，与朋友更好，非常酷。
我能想到的唯一的低点是第二任务的“老鼠”部分以及“洞穴”任务的一些停机部分。

PVP：
没关系，在我短暂的经历中，对近战的重视程度有所减少。
我以前对此没有太大的兴趣，并且很快就失去了兴趣，因此我没有打很多回合，也没有磨一下每个班级来解锁其他更有趣的武器。

（共同）操作：

补丁3.0（2024/09/26）更新：

盔甲损耗与米诺斯更好，这使近战战斗的生存能力降低了惩罚或枪支的依赖​​。混乱派系的调整后的产卵使其不堪重负。

总体而言，进步的进步可以更好地发挥作用，使您感觉更像是太空海军陆战队，但也使游戏更容易（我认为这是可以的，因为它们会增加新的敌人和困难等级）。

他们还用供应豆荚完全康复的角色修复了虫子，最大20％的HP被动/ PERK和用Melta/ las fusil/等康复的健康错误，这很好。

原始发布评论：

只有6个任务发射是可怕的， - 潮汐游戏和Z Z过去的推出更多，但仍然需要更多内容。

平衡似乎到处都是。
在更高的困难下，资源较少，感觉与背部4鲜血和世界大战的战术生存体验相似。取决于您的构建，您希望使用弹药节俭，并将其保存在浪潮/末端/末端或一个敌人，呼吁从伸手可及的地方进行增援。

敌人在更高的困难下变成了子弹海绵状，而且敌人越来越多，而Medicae Stims治愈了HP。不同的武器类型似乎具有不同的有效性与特定敌人。逃到下一个气锁/电梯，在您身后绝望的敌人是俗气有效的，但并不有趣。

您必须在固定的弹药板条箱放置之间进行弹药，并尝试使用近战，环境和设备，您发现的尽可能最佳的设备（爆炸性桶，爆炸性花朵和水平的头，例如火墙第一个任务或上次任务中的火车分流控制面板）。

无论困难如何，任务都具有RNG方面，例如需要0-6（！）子目标完成的中层事件。

PERK和班级平衡似乎无处不在，但是我需要更多地肯定，并且似乎有一些错误或隐藏的效果。
平衡内容的示例：
- 某些班级以后在他们的班级（或武器振兴线）上有弹药的发行，这与其他选择相比似乎是强制性的选秀权；
-  Bulwark的23个PERK恢复了最大HP的健康状况，这将大大减少与处决配对时的治愈物品的需求，或者与Medicae Stim配对时，可以完全减少愈合物品。

另外，您还使用相同的货币购买武器，班级津贴和太空海洋分会定制，并且最初进步时总是感到差，有些课程具有更昂贵的武器（例如攻击）。

您还需要研磨每种班级和武器类型。您可以将一堂课最大化为25级，并且仍然需要将其他武器类型升级，但是试图在更高的困难中做到这一点，因为您的下层武器很弱，对团队和角色的力量产生负面影响。",-0.9955,"{'Nickname': 'ashax', 'Title': '1', 'Play Hours': '147.8', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/id/ashax/', 'Comment': 'Campaign:\nGreat Cinematic experience, better with friends, very cool.\nOnly low point I can think of are the ""Rats"" section of the 2nd mission and some downtime sections from the ""Cave"" mission.\n\nPvP:\nIt\'s ok, a bit death-bally and significantly less emphasis on Melee in my short experience with it.\nI didn\'t have much interest in it before and quickly lost interest in it, so I haven\'t played a lot of rounds nor grind each classes to unlock their other, more interesting weapons.\n\n(Co-)Operations:\n\nPatch 3.0 (2024/09/26) update:\n\nArmor attrition vs Minoris is better which made the melee combat survivability less punishing or gunstrike reliant.

"Regrettably i am leaving a negative review pointing out the serious shortcomings of Space Marine 2 as a veteran Vermintide/Darktide player who loves 40k lore.

- During the first launch of the game, Epic games online components are installed automatically without a prompt screen. I do not want it in my computer. You have to go through loops to uninstall it. There is a reason why i am using steam and steam only and i want the developers to respect it.
- When compared with Darktide, Dawn of War series and especially Mechanicus, Space Marine 2 has the weakest music OST. Looks like it was not even at top ten of the priority list during development.
- As a cheap attempt, the game is trying to draw more attention by Twitch drops.
- Very terrible companion ai. One of the worst i have seen for years. They do not use their ranged weapons in most cases and run gret distances to melee an enemy regarless of the class. And they very rarely execute a stunned elite enemy who is only two feet away from them. Such a shame.
- No FOV slider.
- Holding buttons to activate the abilities, instead of hitting them, is a terrible design choice.
- Throwing a frag grenade takes two seconds, activating cloak takes another 2.5 seconds. Character gets hit during uncancellable animations. Every movement and ability use feels unresponsive and stiff during the campaign and multiplayer. Runningg gets interrupted for no reason even if you are holding shift and not even hit by anything.
- Uncancellable dodge, roll over and similar animations are the primary reason why i keep dying. Controls feel very unresponsive.
- Boss fights are almost identical. Area attacks such as some form of 3 round mortar shots, melee charge attacks, ranged attacks and one big 3-wave either green or purple wide area attack which can hit even behind cover is the same rinse and repeat mechanic for both tyranid and chaos bosses.
- Melee combat is terribly designed. Interruptions are common and costs the player half of his health points.
- Ranged weapons feel weak. An elite enemy (Not a boss or a lecter) takes 30 to 40 bolter rounds to put down. Crossing bone swords makes the enemy immune to ranged damage even if you hit the legs, head or spray it from sides.
- The enemies i have mentioned above are bullet sponges but a hit from them take out half of your hp.
- Crowd control options are limited to grenades. I suggest developers to play Vermintide and Dark Tide to see how it is perfected during many years.
- There is a hideous terrible jetpack mission. I hated it.
- Multiple 'Loading resources - loading logic' screens.
- Entire multiplayer lobby system has to be redesigned. It is bad.
- You cannot inject your allies with the stimpack you have in your inventory.
- PVP section of the game is the worst. Very unbalanced. Is this game not beta-tested?
- Cheaters are out there already. I have already witnessed speedhacks and maphacks.
- Easy Anticheat is known as how 'Easy' it is to bypass it. A bad choice from the developers.
- The number of the co-op missions is very few. These missions in general feel rushed, unfinished and exteremely repetitive with very little variation. Even the spawn locations are more or less the same.
- Unlocking armor pieces or better versions of the same weapon is very grindy. This is how the game targets longevity.
- The game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly. I do not expect it to have a long lifespan.
- I was unable to pickup some medkits, ammo boxes or grenades even i had the inventory slot available. Pickup prompt was not there.
- Ranged enemies shoot with 120% accuracy and every shot lands perfectly.
- There is a shield or armor mechanic which recharges a specific amount with combo kills. This mechanic is not working as intended and definitely not user friendly.

Cnclusion: 6/10. Wait for a discount or buy the cheapest package if you must. After the hype is dead, the game will no longer be played by most of us. I believe that Space Marine 2 would be a great game if it was released 10 years ago.","遗憾的是，我留下了负面评论，指出了Space Marine 2的严重缺点，这是一位热爱40k传说的资深佛教士/Darktide球员。

- 在游戏的第一次启动过程中，Epic Games Online组件将自动安装，而无需及时屏幕。我不希望它在我的计算机上。您必须经过循环才能卸载它。我只使用Steam和Steam是有原因的，我希望开发人员尊重它。
- 与Darktide，战争系列，尤其是Mechanicus相比，Space Marine 2具有最弱的音乐OST。看起来它甚至在开发过程中的优先级排名前十。
- 作为廉价尝试，游戏正试图通过Twitch Drops吸引更多的关注。
- 非常糟糕的伴侣AI。我多年来见过的最糟糕的之一。在大多数情况下，他们没有使用远程武器，并运行格雷特距离以使敌人的敌人混为一谈。而且他们很少执行一个惊人的精英敌人，他离他们只有两英尺。真可惜。
- 没有FOV滑块。
- 握住按钮以激活能力，而不是击打它们，这是一个糟糕的设计选择。
- 扔碎手榴弹需要两秒钟，激活斗篷需要另外2.5秒。角色在无效的动画中被击中。在竞选活动和多人游戏中，每种运动和能力的使用都没有反应和僵硬。即使您持有轮班，甚至没有被任何事情击中，跑步也无缘无故地被打断。
- 我不断死亡的主要原因是无关紧要的道奇，翻滚和类似的动画。控件感觉非常反应。
- 老板的战斗几乎是相同的。区域攻击，例如某种形式的3圆砂浆射击，近战冲锋攻击，远程攻击和一场三波绿色或紫色的大面积攻击，即使在掩护后面也可以击中，这是相同的冲洗和重复机械师。
- 近战战斗的设计非常出色。中断很常见，使玩家的健康点一半。
- 远程武器感到虚弱。精英敌人（而不是老板或莱克特）需要30至40枚螺栓固定的回合才能放下。越过骨头剑会使敌人免疫远程伤害，即使您撞到腿，头或从侧面喷洒。
- 我上面提到的敌人是子弹海绵，但它们的命中率却占据了一半的HP。
- 人群控制选项仅限于手榴弹。我建议开发人员播放佛教和深色潮汐，以了解多年来如何完善它。
- 有一个可怕的Jetpack任务。我讨厌它。
- 多个“加载资源 - 加载逻辑”屏幕。
- 整个多人大厅系统必须重新设计。不好。
- 您无法将盟友注入库存中的Stimpack。
- 游戏的PVP部分是最糟糕的。非常不平衡。这款游戏未经过β测试吗？
- 骗子已经在那里。我已经目睹了Speedhacks和Maphacks。
- 简单的防化被称为绕过它的“容易”。开发人员的不良选择。
- 合作任务的数量很少。这些任务通常感到匆忙，未完成和外部重复，几乎没有变化。即使是生成位置也或多或少相同。
- 解锁装甲件或同一武器的更好版本非常刺耳。这就是游戏的目标。
- 游戏很快变得无聊和重复。我不希望它的寿命很长。
- 即使我有库存插槽，我也无法拾取一些药品套，弹药盒或手榴弹。取货提示不在那里。
- 远程敌人的射击精度为120％，每个射击都完美地着陆。
- 有一个盾牌或装甲机械师，可以用组合杀死特定数量。该机械师无法按预期工作，绝对不是用户友好的。

Even the spawn locations are more or less the same.\n- Unlocking armor pieces or better versions of the same weapon is very grindy. This is how the game targets longevity.\n- The game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly. I do not expect it to have a long lifespan.\n- I was unable to pickup some medkits, ammo boxes or grenades even i had the inventory slot available. Pickup prompt was not there.\n- Ranged enemies shoot with 120% accuracy and every shot lands perfectly.\n- There is a shield or armor mechanic which recharges a specific amount with combo kills. This mechanic is not working as intended and definitely not user friendly.\n\nCnclusion: 6/10. Wait for a discount or buy the cheapest package if you must. After the hype is dead, the game will no longer be played by most of us. I believe that Space Marine 2 would be a great game if it was released 10 years ago."", 'Date': '2024/9/11', 'Language': 'en'}",Success

Under the blessing of the new generation of the screen, this 40K battlefield shocked this one, and it is also pointed in many difficult 40K games.

But why not recommend it?

Because I have played the difficulty of the death angel and I am puzzled by some designs of the game

In a single game:
The infamous elevator guards the 4 chain, and it can be said that it has certain requirements for your efficiency of killing the enemy to flexibly use the scene resource to pass the grenades and explodes the grenades.

However, I can’t understand the scene of the mechanical database development motor. The scene requires you to use the fireproofer to expel the torn worm and turn on the engine and guard for a period of time.
OK, why do you need to set up a long -handed remotely to deal with it when you need to remotely maintain environmental security with short hands?

The pistol can control OK, but the difficulty of the death angel causes the brain insect and meat without changing a large gun.In the case, hit the brain insect to red temperature

OK, can I clean up the ground efficiently and then dry the brain?However, the difficulty of death angels lead to all worm meat and flesh, ordinary double -knife samurai also requires two sets of combo or two guns to hit the red temperature while paying attention to the small tadpoles on the ground.

Can the fireproofer barbecue?You can pinch but the fire is too bright. You can't see the blue circle and red circle. You can only be Euler with the worm. If you are not careful, you will be killed by the despicable insects in the sky in the sky.

Then change the big gun.EssenceEssenceWhy do you have a 1.5 -second confirmation circle for picking a gun?EssenceEssenceWhat blood bag is 1.5 seconds?EssenceEssenceEssenceThe grenade also wants.EssenceEssenceObviously the bullet was taken in an instant.EssenceEssence

In the end, I was red and warm. The crazy grenade skills were used to get the medicine back to the blood generator Qin Wang around AI.
It feels that the core problem is the difficulty of death, it seems that worms have changed meat.Under the difficulty of the veteran soldiers, the warrior 1 shot and 2, 3 knives (1 set of half a consecutive move) can be red and warm, and the death angel requires 2 shots plus 2, 3 sets (two and a half consecutive moves) to red temperature

And our Grandpa Thailand uses his mediocre 3+ shotgun (other weapons is also the basic value), whether it is the veteran or the death angel.EssenceThere was no upgrade content during the battle, which caused Grandpa Thai to use the whiteboard value of the whiteboard value even when it was duel with the final BOSS duel.

Multi -player game PVE:
""Oh, ah, this game is just a single player to support a card. Why is it tangled about this?"" I said nothing wrong with you. I think the feelings of this game.I only tried PVE, so PVP did not comment for the time being.

It can be seen that the production team spent a lot of energy to create 6 occupations, each occupation nearly 20 characteristics, nearly 20 weapons, each weapon, each has a variety of varieties and upgrades, and it feels very dark.The mission is the deputy team that played Grandpa Thai Grandpa in the plot. It is as difficult as the plot.After watching the upgrade options of the weapon, it turned out that Grandpa's 3+ shotgun can finally become 9+. No wonder the difficulty of death is so difficult to be the most elite blue elves outside the main battlefield (red temperature)

Three melee occupations (mad war, assassin, tank) 3 long -range occupations (rifles, sniper, machine gun brothers) can also experience all kinds of fun Thai grandpa for each occupation?Grandpa Tai is the grandfather.

But some of the settings of the game always make me a little confused:
Life value replies: It seems that there are no rest stations in various PVE games in the game. Only the weapon stations for changing equipment. There are only a few blood bags in the map that need to be distributed between three saudial elves, resulting in the blood volume in the task.The more and less in the middle.除了少数职业有“在XX情况下回复1%血量”或者“30%血量下，只要XX就能恢复5%血量”这种回血的天赋，大多数人只能靠倒了拉起和Rebirth to restore your own state.It is indeed a problem with difficult cooperation.

Shield value: Obviously, the production team hopes that the player will make more guns, and the shield will be made to reduce the pressure on the blood bars. Although there is invincible time, it seems that the gun will be interrupted by the red circle attack.The execution of the animation is very handsome, but it is also full. For example, the worm is red and warm. I am a machine gun brother. I may continue to scan and continue to scan two more shots.Worm.It feels that in the actual combat, most people are almost after the team battles are almost finished, and the insects who will challenge the red and warm back are back. I think the better situation is that the elite and the knife and insects have been executed for 1 second to 2 seconds. This may be close to melee.Occupation is more friendly.

Pick up things: 1.5 seconds, why?Make up ammunition?OK, full state, a little punishment, understanding.gun?Afraid of getting the wrong gun, okay.Grenades?I'm afraid that I will change the wrong grenade.Blood bag?Are you afraid I will get more blood bags?The general design waiting circle is because there are multiple uses or conflicts with other behaviors, or the items overlap, or the important choice of key items.The residual blood stimulated all the way to the sloppy worm and finally saw a blood bag & grenado result and could not pass by picked it up (red temperature)

Enemark reminder: The red circle prompt behind appears, you guess what it is.Whether the samurai crosses me, or the brainworm loses me towards me, or the snake worm stab me or the ax is going to throw me.The brain insect is thrown twice, and the rays may be delayed.The only rays that can be recognized are sniper.This has not involved the chaos.What elites on the field rely on the punctuation of good people, especially the Tyron family rushed over in a ball. The light samurai was 4 variants.People.Anyway, the dark tide also gave the elite the big green night view instrument, and inserted some totems on the head of the head, saying that there was a force to say something.There is no special sound effect on this group of white purple and purple tooth dance claws.

Criminal control: clear group, PVE classic bridge section.Do you know Brother?I feel like it is close to the battle brother sucking monsters. The two shot madly.Once the melee brother can't hold it, it seems that there is no occupation to have ridicule, push, block similar skills, and the pressure of long -range brothers has increased greatly.Qingqun weapons are sledgehammers and charging power swords, followed by machine guns, hot melt.Most of the maps have fewer places such as corridor room passing.

Then 6 pictures, so many occupations, so many weapons, just one word, liver.There are 4 aggressive agents in the dark tide, and there are six saudious elves here!IntersectionHowever, there is no weapon entry, and the talent is more passive but not connected to the weapon. It is difficult to imagine what motivation can continue to brush after full level.

I have given so much to give me a not recommendation, because I feel that the content now seems to be at a glance, but I also hope that this game can be done well.40K is known for its dung tour. In the past few years, the game that has changed but the game is also a history of chocolate or chocolate flavor.However, with the publication of the merchant Ronin and the response of the praise of the combat brothers in September 9th, the weapon system will be updated at the end of the dark tide at the end of the month. Is the good life of 40K people come?
Finally, I hope that the SABER group will develop well, with more pictures, and more distinctive and recognizable enemies, which will enable players to develop the talent of interesting gameplay and some of the problems I described above.EssencePlease change it.EssenceEssenceOr do you understand why I designed why?

Thank you

My God has never seen such an unstable server after playing Swedish fat shark
Be strange to one more card operation, one more card, just card, as long as people want to do a ""bomber anti -gun, roll over and spray hot melt again"", the basic operation of the strange group of swimming has a high probability that the server explodes directly
At first I thought it was too high to open the screen, the computers can’t work too much for the particle special effects
The full -opening and low effects are still this way to give you one card, one card, the difficulty melee, do n’t play the knife, and you ca n’t fight the Asian space interference. Total of the September 9th list is to welcome the fighting brothers as chives?Intersection

The PVE weapon is completely unbalanced, and the existence of various models of shotguns is meaningless. The efficiency is not as efficient as hot melt and long -range efficiency.
Hot melting kills all penetrating values ​​unlimited damage and unlimited high, and the talent of killing and rebound is hot -melt.
The special combat soldiers have a 15000+ damage 450+ kill each melee and the two melee will not be able to get together.
Melee brother pure buff pendant person gives hot -melt tactical Gothic back to the shield skills
Special combat brothers and even long -range shield skills can cause AOEDOT damage to add BUFF to the surrounding combat brothers. This special war brother is the core of melee?Intersection
