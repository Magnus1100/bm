"Went into this expecting to be playing a game.
At this point it's not a game, it's a chore and I'm disappointed.

The world, setting, etc are all really nice. It's oddly relatively well performing too which is more than can be said for a lot of bigger games in the last five years.

But, it's busted. The enemy AI targets only the player, doesn't take into account the player mechanics - so you're more than likely to end up between getting hit and getting hit, because if you deign it necessary to block, dodge or parry you are also allowing something else to do their thing because they basically ignore the rest of the squad. This extends out of the campaign to bots in the Operations mode, so there's no respite from awful mechanical failure there either. Never mind the minibosses that stunlock you because you miss a dodge and because of recovery animation just wail on you from 100% to 0 with no way to escape due to how the attack chains are set up. Or the lack of indicator on 90% of parry-possible attacks, or the lack of any form of recovery outside of what would be UT99's worst healing pack in a game that a basic mob can stunlock the protagonist. Ugh.

It feels like an attempt to implement an Arkham style riposte system, but it doesn't work when everything you do with it leaves you open to more damage. Why even use it at that point. Stop targeting only the damned player to the point it's not playable. Please.

EDIT:
After more playtime, some time in multiplayer and practice with the game systems;
Still not sure I want to recommend this.

Multiplayer routinely has connection/stability issues which are not PC/ISP connection related from what I've seen, and the combat whilst satisfying at times still has the issues with stunlock etc.

AI squad members (which you unfortunately see often) are also worse than I initially thought in both campaign and online, having no capability to follow directions (such as attack/defend) featured as part of the main UI, no perks in Operations, no proper target priority when picking one out, no damage against actual boss tier enemies, and more. About the only thing they can do properly is fire a weapon at mobs and recover their own health outside of combat, leaving everything for the player(s) to do which can be borderline impossible. They routinely ruin Operations runs for example.

This game has a single player tag on Steam, but truthfully is not one. If you would buy it as a single player game, look into the solo gameplay in existing videos or streams first as it's a bit deceiving to say it truly is a single player title. It's ALL focused on having a (human) group. All of it.","进入这个期望玩游戏的期望。
在这一点上，这不是一场比赛，这是一件琐事，我很失望。

世界，环境等都非常好。奇怪的是，表现也相对较好，这比过去五年来许多更大的游戏所说的要多。

但是，它破裂了。敌人AI仅针对玩家，不考虑玩家的力学 - 因此，您很有可能在击中和受到打击之间，因为如果您进行封锁，躲避或parry有必要，那么您也是允许其他事情做自己的事情，因为他们基本上忽略了其余的球队。这将活动从操作模式下扩展到机器人，因此那里的机械故障也没有喘息的喘息。没关系，您因为错过了躲闪而stun脚的小东西，因为恢复动画只是从100％到0哭泣，由于如何设置了攻击链，因此无法逃脱。或缺乏90％的帕里（Parry）可能攻击的指标，或者在游戏中基本暴民可能会stunlock stunlock stunlock the the Protogonist的游戏中缺乏任何形式的恢复。啊。

感觉就像是试图实现Arkham风格的Riposte系统，但是当您使用它的所有事情时，它都无法造成更多伤害。为什么在那时甚至使用它。停止仅针对该死的球员，以至于无法播放。请。

编辑：
经过更多的游戏时间，在多人游戏中进行了一些时间，并使用游戏系统进行练习；
仍然不确定我想推荐这个。

多人游戏通常会有与我所看到的无PC/ISP连接的连接/稳定性问题，而战斗有时令人满意的战斗仍然有stunlock等的问题。

AI小队成员（不幸的是，您经常看到的）也比我最初在竞选和在线上想象的还要糟糕，没有能力遵循指示（例如攻击/辩护）作为主要UI的一部分，没有操作的特权，没有当挑选一个时，适当的目标优先级，对实际的老板敌人没有损害，等等。他们唯一能做的事情就是向暴民开火，并在战斗之外恢复自己的健康，这使玩家要做的一切都是不可能的。例如，他们通常会破坏操作。

该游戏在Steam上具有单个玩家标签，但实际上不是一个。如果您将其作为单个玩家游戏购买，请首先查看现有视频或流中的独奏游戏玩法，因为说这确实是单个玩家的标题有点欺骗。所有这些都集中在拥有一个（人类）群体上。所有这些。",-0.9976,"{'Nickname': 'H3X', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '66.4', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/id/-H3X-/', 'Comment': ""Went into this expecting to be playing a game.\nAt this point it's not a game, it's a chore and I'm disappointed.\n\nThe world, setting, etc are all really nice.

"After playing for 40 hours, the view is that the feeling of 40K is a very low -degree of completion.
Personal core point of view
PVE does not make people feel the sense of cutting, and my melee weapon feels stuck.
PVP has a fascinated garbage that is not as good as the page tour.
1. From the story, this game feels like a three -person Superman. The scene is indeed very large. The plot is pure American personal hero film. Then what?I can't see Astart's tactical literacy. The boss is classic to suppress the rights. If you have objections and put forward tactical ideas, you will blush and your neck and stress you as the company commander. The extreme soldier?Then talk about the problem of the three teams. The gunfire on the battlefield is still arguing there to fight there to make a temper there. The Star Army next to the Star Army sacrificed to defend the empire. Tactical literacy is famous for its political mind?Is it possible to let you go more than the chaos?
2. Game playability, two major modes PVP and PVE
The problem of PVP is very large, the production is extremely rough, and the game such as the life and death sniper that is not even inferior to the page game is not even a small map. Is this a Star Warrior?Or is it a primitive fight?The program UI rough is the same as a page game.The overall idea of ​​the PVP is that every occupation of Overwatch has skills and every occupation has a special weapon without any more. You can learn the COD killing rewards. Besides Flying, you can't look up at all below.
The problem of PVE is not as big as PVP but it is also very against the sky. In the past, this type of game was either melee and unparalleled. The zombie flesh flew into the tank and was nervous. The cattle rider's monkey and AOE spitting the single kill with the bull can brag. What are the Star Warriors 2?The melee cutting grass is not hand -of -hand and is abstract. I am afraid it is difficult to keep up with the dull tide group. After pulling the difficulty, it is even more prominent after pulling the difficulty. As a result, the difficulty did not change before the team dared to run customs.
The mechanism of PVE is simply that the firearms are only available to play with hot -melt grenades and plasma. The core daddy system of the melee system game is born for this gadget, because the guns are not specifically prepared at all preparations. The mechanism of special income (don't tell me the pure value of the hot -melt BUG to the light), melee weapons have made three forms for you in order to torture, namely the three attributes of the backbound balance block That is, the core mechanism to fight counterattack to improve the first one is to extend the counterattack window. The second is the window that is default counterattack. The third one cannot fight back. The counterattack can also give the mob's scraping the second, the third one that seems to have given it against the sky is actually still in jail because the core counterattack mechanism cannot be triggered. Back to the white value, you will only be interrupted in the strange pile and you will be interrupted with the warrior's red knife)
You do n’t unlock the complete skill tree or several core professional skills, just go to jail and say that you are your thunder hammer!Which PVE's profession requires frequent release skills to get a big CD?From the thunder hammer to the pistol proficiency, right? The output of the early scraping was interrupted and the charged person was still dying by the remote monster. Is this a PVE? A game that does not allow players to cool?","玩了40个小时后，观点是40k的感觉是非常低的完成度。
个人核心观点
PVE不会让人们感到切割的意义，而我的近战武器会卡住。
PVP的垃圾迷人的垃圾不如页面巡回演出。
1。从故事中，这个游戏感觉就像是一个三人超人。场景确实很大。该情节是纯粹的美国个人英雄电影。那什么？我看不到阿斯塔特的战术素养。老板是压制权利的经典。如果您有反对意见并提出战术想法，您将脸红和脖子，并向您担任公司指挥官。极端士兵？然后谈论三支球队的问题。战场上的枪声仍在在那里争夺在那儿打击。星空军旁边的明星军被牺牲为捍卫帝国。战术素养以其政治思想而闻名吗？有可能让您走得比混乱更多吗？
2。游戏可玩性，两种主要模式PVP和PVE
PVP的问题非常大，生产非常粗糙，而且游戏（例如生死攸关的狙击手）甚至不如Page Game都不是一张小地图。这是一名明星战士吗？还是是原始的战斗？程序UI粗糙与页面游戏相同。PVP的总体想法是，守望先锋的每一次职业都有技能，每个职业都有特殊的武器更多的。您可以学习COD杀戮奖励。除了飞行，您在下面都无法抬头。
PVE的问题不如PVP大，但也非常反对天空。过去，这种类型的游戏要么是近战且无与伦比的。僵尸的肉飞进了坦克，很紧张。牛骑手的猴子和Aoe用公牛吐口水可以吹牛。什么是恒星勇士2？近战切草不是手的手，是抽象的。恐怕很难跟上钝潮的团体。拉起难度后，拉起难度后，它甚至更为突出。结果，在团队敢于运行习俗之前，困难没有改变。
PVE的机制仅仅是枪支只能使用热融化的手榴弹和等离子体发挥作用。近战系统游戏的核心爸爸系统是为此小工具诞生的，因为枪支在所有准备工作中都没有专门准备。特殊收入的机制（不要告诉我光融化的虫子的纯值），近战武器为您制作了三种形式以折磨，即后退平衡块的三个属性，对抗第一个的反击的核心机制是扩展反击窗口。第二个是默认反击的窗口。第三个无法反击。反攻击还可以使暴民的第二次刮擦，这似乎是对天空的第三个实际上仍在监狱中，因为无法触发核心反击机制。回到白色的价值，您只会在奇怪的堆中打断，您会被战士的红刀打断）
您不会解锁完整的技能树或几种核心专业技能，只要入狱，说您是雷声！哪个PVE的职业需要频繁的释放技能才能获得大型CD？从雷声锤到手枪的能力， 正确的？早期刮擦的输出被中断，被带电的人仍被偏远的怪物垂死。这是PVE吗？不允许玩家冷却的游戏？",-0.9938,"{'Nickname': 'Yi', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '70.1', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198404181904/', 'Comment': ""After playing for 40 hours, the view is that the feeling of 40K is a very low -degree of completion.\nPersonal core point of view\nPVE does not make people feel the sense of cutting, and my melee weapon feels stuck.\nPVP has a fascinated garbage that is not as good as the page tour.\n1.

"Is it possible to be a pretty good game for fans of war hammers?
Actually it should be almost completely completely facing fans' works ==
For ordinary players, there are a lot of painful pain
Overall can still play

First of all, the world view ...
Personally do not understand the World View of the War Hammer at all,
The special terms that suddenly emerged in the game are all at a loss,
There is no corresponding explanation in the game or things such as encyclopedia ==
This aspect is really not friendly to new players
However, you can directly understand that Cheng plays a fully armed steel strong man,
To go to the turbulent alien monsters, just XD
There will also be some spectacular scenes
Players who like this style purely can also play for this only for this
(It is the steel strong man who is all armed. It feels too much to defend ...
It is recommended to be simple and difficult to make simple difficulty for it.

As for the plot, it is quite direct,
Very typical European and American movies, anyway, the protagonist is the most correct,
The requirements of the protagonist can solve the problem that the problem is not so much.
Then Uncle Hei was decent, and the teammates of the white back were uncomfortable.












In terms of gaming, you can only say that it is still possible,
Different melee weapons have different attack modules, and there are many long -range weapons to choose from, and the execution is quite handsome.
In addition, the guidance is very good, and there is no egg pain and decryption.
If the battle can accept it, it is basically playing the whole process.
(But the location of the archive is relatively strange ...
It is best to enter the branch mission campaign at the beginning when you are on the spacecraft.
The main line dialogue until half, otherwise, otherwise the main line of this chapter can only start from scratch)
The rest are some bugs, inexplicably dropped the frame, the enemy suddenly disappeared, and the program suddenly stuck to pop up.
There are also some levels, for example, the level that needs to use a flame injection is particularly uncomfortable.
There is no feeling that the fire spray on the enemy at all ...
These problems will affect the experience, and there are many situations encountered.

Then there is music and sound effects,
This personally thinks it is really not too good ...
The sound effect itself is actually okay, but sometimes the big voice is not big, and the sense of disobedience is a bit strong.
However, some music often contains some strange drum sound roar, which will be mixed with the sound effects during the battle.
Plus the time when all kinds of voices are large = =
As a result, when voice, music, and sound effects are mixed together, when they are mixed together,
It often gives people a particularly messy feeling (maybe it is because I did not open the reason for British?)
It's a rare game that I want to deduct points because of the sound experience ...
(But you don't need to care about these problems when you hit it)

In short, the overall evaluation of the individual is about 7 points
If you really like this theme type player or war hammer powder, you should be able to give more than 8 points.","对于战争锤子的粉丝来说，是否有可能成为一个很好的游戏？
实际上，几乎应该完全面对粉丝的作品==
对于普通球员来说，有很多痛苦的痛苦
总体可以玩

首先，世界观...
个人根本不了解战争锤的世界观，
突然在游戏中出现的特殊术语一无所有，
游戏中没有相应的解释或诸如百科全书==之类的东西
这方面对新玩家真的不友好
但是，您可以直接理解Cheng扮演一个完全武装的钢铁强人，
要去动荡的外星怪物，只有XD
还将有一些壮观的场景
纯粹喜欢这种风格的玩家也只能为此效力
（全是武装的钢铁强者。防守感觉太多了...
建议简单且难以为之制定简单的困难。

至于情节，它是很直接的，
无论如何，非常典型的欧洲和美国电影，主角是最正确的，
主角的要求可以解决问题的问题不大。
然后，海叔叔很体面，白色背部的队友不舒服。












在游戏方面，您只能说仍然有可能
不同的近战武器具有不同的攻击模块，并且有许多长距离的武器可供选择，而且执行非常英俊。
此外，指导非常好，没有卵疼痛和解密。
如果战斗可以接受，它基本上是在播放整个过程。
（但是档案的位置相对奇怪...
当您进入航天器时，最好在开始时进入分支机构任务。
主线对话直到一半，否则，本章的主线只能从头开始）
其余的是一些虫子，莫名其妙地掉下了框架，敌人突然消失了，该程序突然粘起来弹出。
例如，还有一些级别，需要使用火焰注射的水平特别不舒服。
根本没有感觉到敌人的火喷雾剂...
这些问题将影响体验，并且遇到了许多情况。

然后是音乐和声音效果，
个人认为这真的不太好...
声音效果本身实际上还可以，但是有时大声的声音并不大，不服从的感觉有些强烈。
但是，有些音乐经常包含一些奇怪的鼓声轰鸣声，这将与战斗中的声音效果混合在一起。
再加上各种声音大的时间= = =
结果，当声音，音乐和声音效果混合在一起时，当它们混合在一起时，
它经常给人们一种特别混乱的感觉（也许是因为我没有打开英国人的理由？）
这是一款罕见的游戏，我想提取积分，因为有合理的体验...
（但是当您遇到这些问题时，您不需要关心这些问题）

简而言之，对个人的总体评估约为7分
如果您真的很喜欢这个主题类型的玩家或战锤粉，则应该能够给予超过8分。",-0.9861,"{'Nickname': '隐性恶疾', 'Title': '1', 'Play Hours': '12.9', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198267866660/', 'Comment': ""Is it possible to be a pretty good game for fans of war hammers?\nActually it should be almost completely completely facing fans' works ==\nFor ordinary players, there are a lot of painful pain\nOverall can still play\n\nFirst of all, the world view ...\nPersonally do not understand the World View of the War Hammer at all,\nThe special terms that suddenly emerged in the game are all at a loss,\nThere is no corresponding explanation in the game or things such as encyclopedia ==\nThis aspect is really not friendly to new players\nHowever, you can directly understand that Cheng plays a fully armed steel strong man,\nTo go to the turbulent alien monsters, just XD\nThere will also be some spectacular scenes\nPlayers who like this style purely can also play for this only for this\n(It is the steel strong man who is all armed.

"Game is fun, great action, beautiful set pieces. But my god, this game has some serious bugs to work out. And they randomly seem to get worse.

Matchmaking is horrrrible.

I spend so much time just trying to get into a match and every step along the way the game is likely to give you an error after a long load screen. Sometimes immediately upon selecting match make it gives you loading screens and then times out, sometimes you're still in your own world and someone else tries to join you and times out. Sometimes you are trying to join someone else's match and long load screen and... times out.

Then, when you finally manage to join a match with other players, half the time you've both chosen the same class and one of you is forced to leave or change to another class that you may not have leveled up high enough to the difficulty you've already selected when choosing matchmaking, you now have to quit the matchmake or risk sabotaging the match for the other players because you dont have the right perks/weapons on this character to pull your own weight.

It's just a badly designed process. And this could at least be balanced out if the game was tuned in a way that you could actually manage things solo. But that's not possible with the garbage NPCs they give you for squadmates. Unless you're max level with max level guns, you're likely not going to be able to pull off even the first operations on easy difficulty.

So much of this game needs more time to cook. Look at the subreddit and you'll see posts like where you upgrade the same weapon and some of its stats go down. Why is that a thing? Not a variant weapon, but the same one has lower stats at a higher level. It's just nonsensical stuff.

I have yet to successfully close the game via the ingame menu without it freezing. Have to alt+f4 or force it to stop via steam. At the end of every mission I either get disconnected or sit through incredibly long load times as the game hangs, then disconnects me from the squad I was with.

Oh, and then the few times I've managed to get a really solid group together and are crushing a mission, 30+ minutes in, the game can hard crash where I'm then forced to reboot my PC and there is no option to rejoin squad mates. So not only do you not get to complete the mission, you get literally zero rewards from it. No XP per kill or per objective completed while you were in the mission. XP only comes at the end of the mission... Again, who in 2024 came up with these backwards ideas and terrible net code?

This game is ultimately just not End User friendly. It wastes your time. The entire time I've been writing this I've been stuck at the end of a mission load screen and am once again going to have to alt+f4. What a mess.","游戏很有趣，动作很棒，精美的套件。但是我的天哪，这个游戏有一些严重的漏洞可以解决。他们似乎随机变得更糟。

对接是可怕的。

我花了很多时间只是试图参加比赛，并且在长期屏幕后，游戏可能会给您带来错误。有时，在选择比赛后立即使您加载屏幕，然后将其播出，有时您仍然在自己的世界中，其他人试图加入您和时光。有时，您正在尝试加入别人的比赛和长载屏幕，以及...时代。

然后，当您最终设法与其他玩家一起参加比赛时，您俩都选择了同一班级的一半，而你们中的一个被迫离开或更改为另一个班级，而您可能没有足够高的升级到难度选择对接会时，您已经选择了，现在您必须退出对接会或冒着破坏其他玩家的比赛的风险，因为您没有此角色上的正确特权/武器来拉动自己的体重。

这只是一个设计不佳的过程。而且，如果您以您可以独自管理事物的方式进行了调整，那么这至少可以平衡。但是，他们为您为中队提供的垃圾NPC是不可能的。除非您使用Max Level Guns的最大水平，否则即使在轻松的难度上，您也可能无法进行第一次操作。

这款游戏的大部分需要更多的时间做饭。查看子雷迪特，您会看到帖子，例如您升级相同武器的位置，其一些统计数据会下降。为什么这是一件事情？不是一种变体武器，但同一武器的统计数据较高。这只是荒谬的东西。

我还没有成功通过Ingame菜单成功关闭游戏而不会冻结。必须Alt+F4或强迫它通过Steam停止。在每个任务结束时，我要么断开连接，要么在游戏悬挂时坐着很长的负载时间，然后使我与与之在一起的球队脱节。

哦，然后我几次设法将一个非常扎实的团队聚在一起，并粉碎了一个任务30分钟以上，游戏可能会严重崩溃，然后我被迫重新启动我的PC，没有任何选择可以重新加入队友。因此，您不仅没有完成任务，而且从字面上获得零奖励。执行任务时，没有XP每次杀死或每个目标完成。XP仅在任务结束时出现...再次，他在2024年提出了这些倒退的想法和可怕的净代码？

该游戏最终不是最终用户友好的。这浪费了您的时间。在整个写这篇文章的整个过程中，我一直陷入任务负载屏幕的末尾，并且再次必须使用Alt+F4。真是一团糟。",-0.9859,"{'Nickname': 'Griselbrand', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '40.2', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/id/griselbrand/', 'Comment': ""Game is fun, great action, beautiful set pieces.

"People gave this game a ton of credit for being well optimized and looking good, but there is a lot missing here.

weapon variety, enemy variety, ramping up difficulty in combat, powering up/adding skills all REALLY lacking.

Combat is OK, melee is ONE (1) button, and feels a little float-y and doesn't have much ""punch"" you kind of just glide through enemies without resistance (outside of executions). parry/dodge/counter works sometimes, doesn't feel consistent. You end up getting staggered, stun locked, or stuck in a reload way to often. It's often not clear why you've taken damage or from where. The input/output in combat just feels kinda weird.

You have to push the SAME button 5000 times, whether an elevator or some other interaction with the environment, it's the same asset. Never a puzzle, or a different way to ""activate"" whatever needs to be activate. Clearly cut corners here.

Cut scenes, pretty good. Some odd points where it feels like a set piece should go fade to black and back in instead. Seems they rushed in several spots.

Story, bare bones but fine. Didn't utilize one of the best-developed fantasy worlds in all of fiction. Voice acting is excellent, and so is the writing though.

.

Other games do what this game should, but better. Helldivers II has better combat. This game takes a lot influence from DOOM, but doesn't execute as well: guns lack punch, glory kills are less rewarding, you have to pause to pick up ammo, mis-calibrated resource scarcity, too many 1 shot horde enemies, too little variety besides ""more"" enemies and no coordination among them.

Overall, it's ok. Not mad I bought it. But could have just watched the cut scenes on youtube and skipped the gameplay.","人们因其优化和看起来不错而获得了很多荣誉，但是这里有很多缺少的东西。

武器品种，敌人的品种，加剧了战斗困难，真正缺乏能力/增加技能。

战斗还可以，近战是一个（1）按钮，感觉有点浮动，并且没有太多的“打孔”您只是在没有阻力的情况下滑过敌人（执行）。帕里/道奇/计数器有时会工作，感觉不一致。您最终会被交错，昏迷或以重新加载的方式被锁定或粘住。通常不清楚为什么您会受到伤害或从哪里受到伤害。战斗中的输入/输出感觉有点奇怪。

您必须按下相同的按钮5000次，无论是电梯还是与环境的其他交互，这都是相同的资产。绝不是难题，也不是“激活”需要激活的任何方法。在这里明显砍下了拐角。

剪裁场景，很好。感觉固定的一件奇怪的点应该变成黑色，然后又倒入黑色。似乎他们冲了几个地方。

故事，裸露的骨头，但很好。在所有小说中，并没有利用最完善的幻想世界之一。声音表演非常好，虽然写作也很棒。

其他游戏会做这个游戏应该做的事情，但更好。地狱二世有更好的战斗。该游戏对厄运产生了很大的影响，但也没有执行：枪支缺乏拳，荣耀杀人的奖励较低，您必须停下来捡起弹药，易于校准的资源稀缺，太多1射击部落敌人，也是如此除了“更多”敌人之外，几乎没有种类，也没有协调。

"Another case of nerfing fun things and putting leashes on players in a PVE mode designed to have a power fantasy.

I guess Saber is unaware what happened with Helldivers 2, I just hope it doesn't take them as long to realize no one wants these changes. Limited ammo uses, sounds really dumb for heavies and snipers that rely on ammo but ok, tougher enemies, they already take 3/4 of the mag to get to the executable stage but ok.
-70% melta-bomb damage to bosses? It only has one use, and that was its designated purpose, what were you thinking? The worst offense being, putting the imaginary leash on teammates so if the need to restore armor is present it CANNOT be done unless teammates are nearby? Who thought that was a good decision, I would love to see how that idea was received in the board room if Saber even held a meeting for this design choice.
Either none of Saber plays their own game or they just wanted their player base to leave because playing one game would have told you that snipers, assaults, and vanguards tend to leave their allies to focus on damage dealers to help the team but now they are punished for doing so. Having to constantly check to see if your team is near you so you can restore your only source of replenish-able health is insanely stupid and means that if we use our ability to grapple, or jump pack to a distant enemy (which is what its class is literally SUPPOSED TO DO) we are punished for it by not receiving armor back.

This is Helldivers 2 treatment all over again with Publishers and Development not listening to their player base and not playing or experiencing their own nightmarish decisions and acting like it's what we've asked for all along. Thanks for the fun while it lasted Saber.","另一个案例是，在PVE模式下，旨在具有力量幻想的PVE模式下将牵引力放在玩家身上。

我猜Saber并不知道Helldivers 2发生了什么，我只是希望他们不会花很长时间才意识到没有人想要这些更改。有限的弹药使用，听起来确实是依靠弹药的重的狙击手和狙击手，但是好的，更强硬的敌人，他们已经占用了3/4的磁场才能进入可执行的阶段，但还可以。
-70％的Melta-Bomb对老板的伤害？它只有一种用途，那就是它的指定目的，您在想什么？最糟糕的进攻是将虚构的皮带放在队友身上，因此，如果需要恢复装甲的需要，除非队友在附近，否则无法完成？谁认为这是一个很好的决定，我很想看看Saber甚至举行了此设计选择会议，我很想在董事会会议室收到这个想法。
要么Saber都没有玩自己的游戏，要么他们只是希望自己的球员群体离开，因为玩一场比赛会告诉您，狙击手，攻击和先锋队往往会离开盟友，专注于伤害经销商来帮助团队，但现在他们是这样做的惩罚。必须不断检查一下您的团队是否靠近您，以便您可以恢复您唯一的补充可补充健康的来源是疯狂的愚蠢，这意味着，如果我们利用我们的能力抓紧或跳到遥远的敌人（这就是它的从字面上看，班级应该这样做）我们因不接收盔甲而受到惩罚。

这是Helldivers 2的待遇，出版商和开发不会听他们的球员群，也没有玩耍或经历自己的噩梦决定，并且表现得像我们一直要求的那样。感谢您在持续Saber时的乐趣。",-0.9324,"{'Nickname': 'Pel', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '196.3', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006601029/', 'Comment': ""Another case of nerfing fun things and putting leashes on players in a PVE mode designed to have a power fantasy.\n\nI guess Saber is unaware what happened with Helldivers 2, I just hope it doesn't take them as long to realize no one wants these changes.
