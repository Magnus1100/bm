"Fans are doing well in the game, but the process is very short.PVE requires liver things, but there are very few levels, which is very easy to get tired.Aside from some old -fashioned problems such as plug -in, teammates' mentally retarded AI, optimization, and not supporting widescreen, etc., list several personal experience:
1. The characters are extremely fragile. The shield is the same as paper. After full level, go to the simplest difficulty to practice weapons. It is mixed with a group of mobs with a samurai.The remote monster was almost virtual, and then from time to time, I still brushed the monsters outside of my vision behind me, and came in directly outside the screen to surprise me.When you apply Captain Jia to say, ""I have been associated with these mobs at level 1, and level 25 is still abused by them. Isn't TM upgraded?""
2. The weapon is extremely unbalanced, and the difficult and difficult hot melt is almost a must -have. The result of the danger of melee weapons is not as good as the hot melting out of the risk of being beaten.Block, the problem is that it can be understood with the professional setting of Dunwei. What about the assault?I hope you can do a good job of balance between weapons, but be careful not to weaken hot -melt, but to strengthen other weapons.There must be a few weapons in the game that there must be a few without players, but when most weapon players do not want to touch, what does it mean to design these things?
3. The judgment of the gun attack is extremely weird. It is nearly far, and sometimes you can not put the face when you can shoot the face. Sometimes it is inexplicably given you one by one. There is no invincible judgment during the gun attack.The first attack was blocked in the tyrant's multiple attacks, but it was killed by the second attack in the gun attack.You must want to encourage players to use this system, but what does it mean to violent during use?
4. I used the handle. I accidentally pressed the ""New Game"" option by accidental picture, and then entered some pictures set by some games in the new game, but I wanted to go back to the title screen but could not find the option at all. ESC was useless.I do n’t know if there is any revision of this problem now. At that time, I was worried that I would cover the archive. I closed the game by alt+F4.Are you funny?
5. The weapon is extremely boring. The main reason is that the weapon design mentioned above is imbalanced, coupled with the combination of monster supermodels, and the rogue quality of highly difficult weapons to use low weapons to make the entire process extremely suffering.If you don't want to balance the weapon, add a groove that can store excess experience after adding a weapon, so that I can allocate the extra experience obtained after the full level to other weak chicken weapons.
6. I don’t know what kind of triggering mechanism is brushing. Sometimes, in the absence of monsters, there are many waves of monsters in the current area, and then there is almost no strange in the next battle area.Does it look at us and then improvise the monsters in the next area to generate it in advance?
7. Locking this feature, I do n’t know which genius is done. After locking the monster, the monster is not only in the center of your field of vision.","粉丝在游戏中表现不错，但是过程很短。PVE需要肝脏，但是很少有水平，这很容易疲倦。从一些老式的问题（例如插件），插件，队友'精神智障的AI，优化，不支持宽屏等，列出了几种个人经验：
1。角色极为脆弱。盾牌与纸张相同。完整的水平之后，去练习武器的最简单困难。它与一群暴民和武士混合在一起。遥远的怪物几乎是虚拟的，然后不时地，我仍然把怪物刷在我身后的视线外，然后直接进入屏幕外面让我感到惊讶。您将贾上尉说：“我在1级与这些暴民有关，而25级仍被他们滥用。是否升级了TM？”
2。武器极为不平衡，并且困难而困难的热融化几乎是必须的。近战武器危险的结果不如遭受殴打的风险融化的好处，问题在于，它可以通过邓韦的专业环境来理解它。那袭击呢？我希望您能在武器之间保持良好的平衡，但要小心不要削弱热 - 融化，而要加强其他武器。游戏中必须有几个武器，必须有几个武器玩家，但是当大多数武器玩家不想触摸时，设计这些东西意味着什么？
3。枪击的判断非常奇怪。它几乎是远的，有时候，当您可以拍摄脸部时，您无法将脸放置。有时，它莫名其妙地给您一个一个。在枪支袭击期间没有无敌的判断。第一次攻击在暴君的多次攻击中被阻塞，但由于枪支攻击中的第二次攻击而被杀死。在使用中暴力？
4。我使用了手柄。我意外地按下了“新游戏”选项，然后输入了新游戏中某些游戏设置的一些图片，但我想返回标题屏幕，但找不到该选项。ESC是没有用的。我不知道现在是否对此问题进行了任何修订。那时，我担心我会掩盖档案。我关闭了Alt+F4的游戏。您有趣吗？
5。武器非常无聊。主要原因是上面提到的武器设计是不平衡的，再加上怪物超模的结合，以及使用低武器来使整个过程极其苦难的极难武器的流氓质量。如果您不想平衡武器，添加一个可以在添加武器后可以存储多余经验的凹槽，以便我可以将完整级别后获得的额外经验分配给其他弱鸡武器。
6。我不知道刷牙是什么样的触发机制。有时，在没有怪物的情况下，当前区域中有很多怪物浪潮，然后在下一个战斗区几乎没有奇怪的地方。进步？
7.锁定此功能，我不知道完成了哪个天才。锁定怪物后，怪物不仅处于视野的中心。",-0.9991,"{'Nickname': 'Ash', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '107.1', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198266921907/', 'Comment': 'Fans are doing well in the game, but the process is very short.PVE requires liver things, but there are very few levels, which is very easy to get tired.Aside from some old -fashioned problems such as plug -in, teammates\' mentally retarded AI, optimization, and not supporting widescreen, etc., list several personal experience:\n1.

"Make the fans of war hammers satisfied, general players recommend a discount

Foreword:
After a lapse of 13 years, the generation of Star Warriors, formerly known as ""War Hammer: Killing Wushuang"", finally ushered in a sequel. The sequel not only changed the developer but also changed the publisher. It is produced by the team that has developed ""War World Z"", so there are many WWZ gameplay shadows, but the ""execution"" characteristics of the previous game have been retained; The problem of unstable instrument and repeated content of the existing game make some players feel that some players do not meet the pricing, but if you are the servant of the emperor's enthusiasm, now it is time to present loyalty!




The story of the game lasted for the first generation. Although the protagonist of the extreme warrior, although he tried to resist Okuk and chaos, he was still sent to the end of the trial court because he was accused of being stained with chaos. He was included in the ""Death Watching"" battle that specializes in the Termine Zerg. After a centennial battle of the Zerg, Titus was seriously injured in a mission. To live, the battle regiment transformed him into a more powerful ""Original Star Fighter"" and allowed him to return to the team as the deputy. Essence

The second -generation stories are developing compact, smooth narrative, and fully demonstrated the ""hard -core men's"" war hammer style. In the single -player battle, we played Titus to lead the new extreme soldiers to perform various tasks to prevent the Zerg and chaotic forces. In the PVE mission, the perspective of another team will help Titus complete the task and strengthen the plot not mentioned in the battle, but there is almost no element in the single -player battle, so that the sense of growth and change in the battle process will lack a sense of growth and change in the battle. Sex makes the battle a bit like a teaching for multiplayer models. The entire process is relatively short, about 7-8 hours of length. It is similar to a generation, which is a pity.






Whether it is the main line of battle or the PVE mode, players can enjoy the sense of refreshing combat strikes in this game. Use various weapons in the world of war hammers, such as ""power swords"" and ""hot melting guns"" to slaughter the Terlen Zerg However, strictly speaking, this game is not a unparalleled game. In the battle, under various Zerg enclosures, the armor and blood volume of the characters will be exhausted soon (not at all). The armor can be recovered with time. The blood volume is to kill the enemy to return the blood while turning the black background. We can only get an injection to make up for the black background. Therefore, we need to use the combat mechanism to make a certain ""right move"" with the enemy.

The Zerg soldiers rarely affect the players. You can concentrate on dealing with various elite heads on the battlefield. When the enemy attacks, the perfect grid and dodge can perform a ""gun attack"". Two enemies will show flaws. At this time, we can perform ""execution"" to restore armor immediately. This execution process is different from the generation. Invincible state can also be triggered at mid -range. Try to execute as much as possible!

It may not be refreshing enough to fight at first, but it is much simpler after mastering the way to interact with the enemy, but because of this, almost all battles will be carried out in the process of ""defense → gun attack → execution"". It will become a bit duplicate, no matter what the situation and occupation are inseparable from ""execution"".






In the PVE mode of the game, we can choose one of the six Star Warrior occupations to check the level. Each occupation has a fixed equipment that can be used, as well as unique skill trees. The weapon data collected in the level can make the guns skilled and get the number of gun skills. The current professional strength is a bit unbalanced. At the same time, the upgrade progress of each occupation is completely independent. If you practice heavy heads, the repetition will be relatively high.

The design purpose of the level used as PVE is to strengthen the main line of the main line, so there is a very fixed process in the level. Although the elite leader of the appearance is random, the overall change is not large. There will be a combination of map randomness+task randomness, so the repetition of the scrolling level will be faster and easier to get tired than other games under the comparison. Overall, the number of levels is not enough.

But like other war hammers IP games, this game has a very rich custom content. There can be various imprints, runes and badges on the armor, as well as 9 major legions, teams, and even Chaos Star Warrior factions. Various decorations and styles can be collected, but if you want to collect these decorations, there will be a long -length clearance process. It can be said to be created for fans. At present, one of the main incentives and pursuit of goals in multiplayer games.





现 The excellent picture performance, the battle scene of the spectacular epic battle
剧 Wonderful and compact plot, continuing the story of the generation
的 Fastened fighting, all kinds of execution of blood spraying slurry
装The handsome armor shape and appearance

The single -player battle process is short, and there are problems with optimization of specific scenes

The game is currently optimized and the server connection is rotten, as well as a service -oriented game that is also a war hammer IP, such as the ""Plague"" series or a relatively new ""Black Tide"". After a month of upsurge, the number of players may drop sharply. This can only wait for the number of levels of the multi -person model after the official update. In terms of the current version, the situation of the war hammer powder can play very much. If you are satisfied, the non -fan is only a single CP value, and it is easy to enlarge the existing problems. Therefore, it is recommended that non -fan players can wait a little discount before starting.

For the first time, the game will be forced to install EPIC Online Serivers software. This is to allow users of different platforms to connect to the platform. The official seems to be written in the EULA protocol. If you really care, there are many ways to teach players on the Internet how to stop EOS.

"Sorry for the money spent.The difficulty in the game sucks.The game should be called Kalgar

The main claim to the game is that you are at least somewhat tall about the difficulties, you do not feel like a spaceport.This is a colossus that tears all his hands, in this game there is just a whiting toy.God forbid, you decided to fight in a mile fight against 2+ enemies or go out in an open field against the Renge Mobes - you will immediately have a health pole to be removed.The game seems to imply that you will fight the hordes of enemies, but there are no tools under this.In L4D you can repel, in Darctayda to repel and sterefy, to quickly run away to DIP COK.Here, if you have already been surrounded or just running after you, then you do not have an option except to get guaranteed damage.It will not work to run away, you are even caught up in the rifts.You can’t push it away, it’s not like that.It’s also impossible to bake everything either - there are few frames for this business, and there are too big things between the new Perry and the Old.You can soak the whole crowd, but while you will charge the attack, then you are just throwing you behind the cheek.The rally effect does not work as it should work.Having received damage, he gradually subsides, but you have such a delay on almost all the guns between the blows that it will not work to restore the health that you lost in the crowd.Constantly in the fight against the crowd you will sag.At the same time, we can say that the option is to confront this is a rang-armed, but this is not so, since it is all bad, it is not a little, it slows you off or is not at all capable of crowds.

Instead of playing for a super-mega tank, I seem to play for a suffocation that flies into a lobby with 1 missed poke.I do not feel any speed or reaction of Spacmarin, his strength and vitality.Rather, I feel that some kind of omeganchik was stuck with a papier-masha with a armor, while everyone around was driven in titanium alloys.

At the end of the game, I am already morally tired that the dodgers are poorly made that the mobs are not sharpened for this.The same chaos dreadnought has an attack from which it is impossible to escape, but it can be avoided with a dump, but he immediately makes another attack, so that, as they would call the Souls in Dark, to catch in the roll.

Any enemies were still angry with any revenge.1 spray of any machine gunner with knocked out armor - in a better case, you will tear off the half -hundred.In the worst 90%

In general, plot - approx.Gameplaino in high complexity is nonsense, where a high risk is not awarded, but on the contrary, hesitates hard.If someone was looking for an interesting slasher, where there will be an interesting gameplay with Chelenge - you are not there.To you in Octo, Gonister, etc.And this game will only spoil the mood from the fact that the game is deceiving you.This is a dishonest gameplay system, and I only walked here behind Chelendge, but I just got a tight stream in my mouth","对不起，花了钱。游戏中的困难。游戏应称为卡尔加

游戏的主要主张是，您至少对困难有些高，您不会觉得自己像个太空港。决定在与2个以上的敌人的一英里战斗中战斗或在一个空旷的领域与Renge Mobes一起出去 - 您将立即将健康杆去除。游戏似乎意味着您将与成群的敌人作战，但是那里在L4D中没有工具。得到保证的伤害，这不会逃跑，您甚至会陷入裂谷中。新的佩里和旧的东西之间有太大的事情。您可以吸收整个人群，但是虽然您会收取攻击，但您只是将您扔到脸颊后面。集会效应不起作用，因为它应该起作用。受到损害后，他逐渐消退，但是您几乎在打击之间的所有枪支都延迟了，以至于无法恢复您在人群中失去的健康。同时，我们可以说，选择是面对这是一个响臂，但事实并非如此，因为一切都不好，它不是一点，它会使您慢下来或根本没有人群的能力。

我似乎没有为超级梅加坦克（Super-Mega Tank）效力，而是为了窒息而苦苦地飞到一个带1个错过的大厅里。Omeganchik的摄影作品被带有装甲的纸巾粘住，而周围的每个人都被钛合金驾驶。

General commentary
If you want to enjoy the series fans, the sense of presence and the world, those who are tired of the character that tends to be in recent shooters, or to lovers soul -based shooters.
I regret buying it because I think it's a hord shooter and I don't recommend it.At least it didn't suit me.
He had the impression that he had forced the horn shooter, the soul, and the hunt, but as a horn shooter, the upper enemy was too hard and there were too many small fish enemies for soul and hunt.

What I think is good
1: You can customize the armor quite well (the character itself is fixed with a unusual uncle who plays the role, but it is good)
2: A sense of presence from the solid world view
3: A refreshing finisher can be fired repeatedly

What I thought it didn't suit me
Overall game
1: If you make it a head -like soul -like that seemed to be a horn shooter, you will be able to do it immediately
2: The movement is light (I think it has a solid feeling to some extent, but a little too much, stress on a large crowd)
3: There is no gap between the top enemies from inside, and if it is a 1vs hunter like a game that hunts a certain monster, it may be fine, but there is a large amount of small fish enemies and long -range attacks from all sides.Title
4: This gun is just a bean gun, but the enemy flies and flies to the sky, which is simply boring.
5: There are few weapons that are suitable for the horde, and there are some things that can strengthen the penetration of bullets by doing their best and raising their levels, but I didn't think I would do that.
6: At the time of writing this review, I feel that the armor is too nervous and the means of recovering physical strength is too limited, so I personally like games that can be enjoyed more easily, so I didn't fit me.

Terminid
1: The upper enemy is too hard and the power of this gun is delicate and there is no exhilaration, feeling like shooting a sponge.
2: The upper enemy floats has no gap, has a lot of physical strength, has a lot of barrier, and shoots a long -range attack.
3: The lower enemies fall on their own if they defeat all the middle enemies around them, but the most important middle enemies appear in Barrett sponge and quite a group.

chaos
1: Even if the middle enemy is stiff and shoots with a gun, it runs away by teleport even if you hit it, and the enemy shoots infinitely from all sides.To be clear, shit
2: There is a shield in the lower enemies, and it often springs up in a considerable number of people.Fucking
3: The high -end humanoid long -range type does not flicker, and it is infinite high -heat.Fucking
4: I don't like the color.Fucking
5: Chaos shit","在《战锤》系列中，这场比赛首先是出现的，故事等是在不了解故事的情况下进行的。

一般评论
如果您想欣赏系列粉丝，存在感和世界，那些厌倦了往往是在最近的射手中的角色或基于情人的射手的人。
我很遗憾地购买它，因为我认为这是一个小射击者，我不建议它。至少它不适合我。
他给人的印象是，他迫使霍恩射击者，灵魂和狩猎，但是作为一个喇叭射击者，上层敌人太硬了，有太多的小鱼敌人无法进行灵魂和狩猎。

我认为是好的
1：您可以很好地自定义盔甲（角色本身与扮演角色的不寻常叔叔固定，但很好）
2：从扎实的世界观中的存在感
3：可以反复发射清爽的装修器

我认为它不适合我
整体游戏
1：如果您使它成为一个像象形的人一样，似乎是一个射手射击者，您将能够立即做到这一点
2：运动很轻（我认为它在某种程度上具有扎实的感觉，但太多了，压力很大）
3：从内部的顶级敌人之间没有差距，如果它是一个1VS猎人，就像一个狩猎某个怪物的游戏一样所有侧面
4：这枪只是豆枪，但敌人飞到天空上，这简直是无聊的。
5：很少有适合部落的武器，有些事情可以通过尽力而为并提高其水平来增强子弹的穿透力，但我认为我不会那样做。
6：在撰写这篇评论时，我觉得盔甲太紧张了，恢复体力的手段太有限了，因此我个人喜欢更容易享受的游戏，所以我不适合我。

终端
1：上敌人太硬了，这把枪的力量很细腻，没有令人振奋的感觉，就像射击海绵一样。
2：上层敌人的浮子没有差距，具有很大的体力，具有很多障碍，并进行了长时间的进攻。
3：下层敌人如果他们击败周围的所有中间敌人，但最重要的中间敌人出现在巴雷特海绵和一个群体中。

混乱
1：即使中间敌人僵硬并用枪射击，即使您击中它，它也会被传送逃跑，敌人从各个方面射击。
2：下敌人有一个盾牌，它经常以相当多的人形式浮出水面。
3：高端的类人形长 - 范围不会闪烁，并且是无限的高热。
4：我不喜欢颜色。

"Please realise that this is literally one of the only games I've been looking forward to for a very very long time. I was hoping of actually enjoying a game for the first time in months, just for everything I feared to manifest after more than just a few hours of gameplay. Initially I thought the game was phenomenal, the weighty thump of the bolters, the tearing viscera of chainswords, the diverse abilities and a 2010s storyline packed with an explosive finale. I finished the game on the 2nd highest difficult, as reccomended, and wanted to try out more gameplay.

So I decided to play outside of the story mode.

The highest difficulty, Ruthless, shows the true colors of this game. After breezing through the first three difficulties and getting my class to high level, more issues began to arise as I became more intent on progressing my weapons. That's when the most glaring problems began to show; the combat is incredibly clunky with parries and snapshots almost guaranteeing you will be hit by 2-3 other enemies if you take them. The enemies themselves are monotonous to fight against with less AI responsiveness than even Halo Reach had, a game 14 years old. There's only six operation missions in total that most of them range from tedious to straight out not fun (people know the agony of the Heldrake mission while playing as Assault/Vanguard/Bulwark). The assault fails in any degree of melee, despite being for its namesake an ""assaulting"" class to get into close combat, meanwhile the fully-ranged heavy's best weapon is its close range multi-melta. PvP is a mess with a TTK that feels either like I'm playing HLL/Squad but swaps to Halo Reach but everyone has armor lock in an instant. Trying to play the campaign again shows how much the story was the definition of a one-time experience with much of the plotholes and abandoned storylines showing far more glaringly on the second playthrough. Almost all the weaponry is borderline identical save for the melta which is the only usable weapon in high level Operations, of which you will probably be kicked if you aren't using a melta or playing Bulwark 60%%+ of the time. The lack of mechanical flow in the melee kills any degree of skill-based gameplay with even using core mechanics like parrying and snapshots working against you 90% of the time by opening yourself up to other attacks for a solid 1+ second. In melee you are entirely powerless against any more than 3-4 enemies even if its just gaunts or tzaangors. Of which, even the most minor of enemies take several shots/hits to even stagger them (again, unless you use a melta). Tack all of this onto a subpar overall multiplayer experience with three total maps, 60-90+ second load times on a current-gen PC, an AI that would barely function as a support chatbot on a corporate website, borderline unfair enemy spawns (neurothrope vs melee-centric teams), ranged enemies that you can't even see shooting through entire buildings and walls, and to cap it all off I can't even play as a custom or my favourite chapter without hearing them recite a voice line about Ultramar or the Guilliman every 15 seconds.

It feels like they were rushed to do the bare minimum to call it a ""complete"" game, but failed to do any quality testing beyond the initial gameplay mechanics. These are all things they can, and I hope certainly will, fix in a few weeks to months of patches, but if you want a complete list of changes I would suggest and that I've seen others propose, you can read them below.

- Add I-Frames to parry/snapshots like executions currently have
- Have melee regenerate small amounts of HP on kill or increase the current healing mechanic in melee dramatically as stimpacks are way too far and few between while having no real way of getting HP back
- Nerf the melta's HP regen while buffing ranged HP regen hit (You can go from 1-100% HP in a single shot of melta vs getting maybe 10-15% of your HP back with a bolter)
- Remove the stagger from the melta (I don't think anyone can argue that having a melta on Ruthless makes the game 10x easier when the enemies can't even swing back and hordes disappear in 1-2 shots)
- Increase practically all bolter damage to actually be a real bolter and annihilate soft targets in 1-2 shots
- Rework Operations Assault entirely - Copy/pasting the current PvP Assault mechanics onto Operations, make the hammer viable with faster swings/heavies, make the fist viable by doing massive single-target damage
- Add more boss-oriented Operations or alternative endings (the final boss fight in the campaign was 10/10 and the Hive Tyrant was pretty good as well)
- More melee weapons that actually feel different. A power axe for anti-elites, eviscerator for anti-horde, and so on.
- More hordes. There's too many times where I feel like I'm fighting a probing force rather than an entire hive invasion fleet.
- Make walls actually solid and ranged enemy attacks not go through them (pretty obvious)","请意识到，这实际上是我很长时间以来一直期待的唯一游戏之一。我希望几个月来真正享受游戏，这是我不仅仅几个小时的游戏玩法而渴望表现出来的一切。最初，我认为这场比赛是惊人的，抛箭的重击，链剑的撕裂内脏，各种能力和2010年代的故事情节充满了爆炸性的结局。我以第二高的困难完成了比赛，并想尝试更多游戏玩法。

因此，我决定在故事模式之外玩。

最高的困难，无情，显示了该游戏的真实颜色。在经历了前三个困难并使我的班级高水平的情况下，随着我变得更加打算进步武器，就开始出现更多的问题。那是最明显的问题开始出现的时候。战斗非常笨拙，帕拉里斯和快照几乎可以保证，如果您拿走了2-3个敌人。敌人本身是单调的，可以与AI的反应能力少于14岁的一场比赛。总共只有六项操作任务，其中大多数从乏味到直接不有趣（人们在演奏攻击/先锋/堡垒时都知道Heldrake任务的痛苦）。尽管其同名是“攻击”阶级，但袭击在任何程度的近战中都失败了，与此同时，全面的重型武器是其近距离的多熔武器。PVP与TTK混乱，感觉就像我在玩HLL/Squad一样，但可以互换Halo，但每个人都瞬间都有Armor Lock。试图再次进行竞选活动表明，这个故事是对一次性体验的定义，其中大部分斑点和废弃的故事情节在第二次播放中显示出更加明显的表现。几乎所有的武器都是边缘性的，除了梅尔塔（Melta）外，这是高级操作中唯一可用的武器，如果您不使用Melta或玩Bulwark 60 %%以上，则可能会被踢。近战中缺乏机械流程会杀死任何基于技能的游戏玩法，即使使用核心力学和快照（例如，在90％的时间内）通过对其他攻击进行1秒钟以上的核心攻击，以对付您90％的时间。在近战中，即使它只是笨拙或tzaangors，您也完全无能为力。其中，即使是最小的敌人，甚至会拍摄几枪/命中甚至将它们弄干（再次，除非您使用Melta）。将所有这些都贴在低于标准的多人游戏体验中，并在当前代码的PC上拥有三张总地图，60-90+第二次加载时间，AI几乎无法用作公司网站上的支持聊天机器人，边界不公平的敌人产卵（Neurothrope）（Neurothrope）vs以近战为中心的团队），远程敌人，您甚至看不到整个建筑物和墙壁的射击，并且要限制所有的敌人Ultramar或Guilliman每15秒钟。

感觉就像他们被急于最低限度地称其为“完整”游戏，但是除了初始游戏机制之外，没有进行任何质量测试。这些都是他们所能做的，我希望可以在几周到几个月的补丁程序中修复，但是如果您想要完整的更改列表，我建议您建议，并且我已经看到其他人提出了建议，则可以在下面阅读它们。

- 将i框架添加到parry/快照（例如执行）当前具有
- 使近战杀死时少量的HP或增加近战中当前的治愈机制，因为Stimpacks距离太远，而没有真正的方法使HP恢复原状
- 梅尔塔（Melta）的惠普（HP）恢复时，在射击范围内的HP恢复命中率（您可以从单一镜头中从1-100％的HP中获得1-100％的HP，而Melta vs则可以通过Bolter获得10-15％的HP）。
- 从梅尔塔（Melta）中取出交错（我认为没有人会争辩说，当敌人甚至无法向后摆动而成群的射击中，在敌人甚至无法摆脱时，游戏中的梅尔塔（Melta）便变得更加容易。
- 实际上增加了所有挥舞所有损伤，以实际成为真正的螺栓固定器，并在1-2杆中歼灭软目标
- 完全返工操作攻击 - 将当前的PVP突击机制复制/粘贴到操作上，使锤子可行，以更快的秋千/重量，使拳头通过造成巨大的单目标伤害使拳头可行
- 添加更多面向老板的操作或其他结局（竞选中的最后一场老板战斗是10/10，蜂巢暴君也很好）
- 更多的近战武器实际上有所不同。用于反精英的动力斧，抗野外的eviscerator，依此类推。
- 更多的成群。我觉得我觉得我正在与探测力量作斗争，而不是整个蜂巢入侵舰队。
- 使墙壁实际上是坚实和远程敌人的攻击不会贯穿的（显而易见的）",-0.9966,"{'Nickname': 'Quackers', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '52.6', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/id/QuackerCracker/', 'Comment': 'Please realise that this is literally one of the only games I\'ve been looking forward to for a very very long time.

"In general, an incredibly good design, attention to details, small jokes (KP-42, I shake your hand), excellent knowledge and embodiment in motion and sound of a back, a simple and slender plot.

Objectively gameplay, the complete gat about, subjectively to “good” remained quite a bit, but the work was abandoned.There was a feeling that everything except the gameplay component had a clear vision.Only a complete overhaul with the involvement of normal gameplay masters will save.

Some weapons were not embarrassed by parameters (power fist), for some reason they took the opportunity, especially it was important for the devastators, to go into evasion during the “included” sight, you cannot start finishing in the sight of the sight, it is absolutely not clear why they spoiled the attack aircraft, who needs it.These kuldowns and freezing to think with the fall point in eternity.Absolutely disgusting cute fighting, it seems that we can spoke the attack, but this does not give anything, the enemy continues a series of attacks, it is easiest to dodge any attack if it is a small enemy that can be canceled with this, panicers from a pistol are rare, except for the framesInvulnerability, they do not carry.The attacks of the enemy do not interrupt the attack, we can only be introduced to the enemy into the light stegger.In the first part, the bolters carried impact due to the abundance of ordinary opponents, who quickly and picturesquely died under the flashes of the detonations of mass-reactive shells, here the usual Horoga-Correne or thermal Education can be paused several hits, deaths are lost in the crowd.5 varieties of ordinary bolts were lost in impact.

The dumped, patented horde technology has the same problem in the director's approach as the World War Z, we have an integral event, we are not the main part and the part is not the main one, we are dangling somewhere on the side.It seems that we are shown a giant horde, a general battle, tanks go into battle, the infantry is lining up in orders from dioramas, Astra Militarum supports the platoon of the 2nd company of ultra -harsh, but it simply leads us to the pocket of more local events, the general battle addresses the players only in the playersIn one mission of special operations (PVE of missions).It seems that we will even find ourselves in a general event, but we immediately leads us to another pocket and we go to beat three cripples, instead of a large -scale vagrakalov’s face.

Pow content with 6 short missions, for some reason there is no survival in a separate mission.
PVP Classic Trileine on small teams, I did not even go into other modes.
The pumping suddenly turned out to be divided, which differs from the first part and does not contribute to enthusiasm.

In general, the delight and positive emotions from the plot and pve received, the money was repulsed by 11/10, but with such a gameplay, linger longer than I could play, it will not work, a little sorry.

After such an amount of ASSETS for Astra Militarum, Seibers are required to release the game in the guard.","通常，一个非常好的设计，对细节的关注，小笑话（KP-42，我握手），运动和背部的出色知识和体现，简单而又苗条的情节。

"Where do I even start. Not sure who started the rumour, but the campaign is not 6 hrs, f that. It's way longer. I've clocked 14hrs on normal difficulty and skipped half the side missions. I'd say 16-17hrs max on normal. This is an AWESOME game. Masculinity incarnate. Ticks all the boxes. Brotherhood, a calling for a higher purpose, good vs evil. This is a blokes game. It will tickle every masculine atom in your body. That's not to say females wont enjoy this game, you will, it just means you're an ultimate badass.

You don't have to be a lore expert here. I myself am a casual warhammer fan. I just know the basics. And you can too, there are many 1 hour videos on youtube that will read you the basics, and get you up to snuff. Watch one of those and your done.

But here's the gist.

Play as a 7ft tall superhuman soldier, a space marine, created by the Emperor himself. It's a grim dystopian future, humanity is in a constant galactic war for it's very survival. A galactic war that has no end. A war that has raged for tens of thousands of years. A war against Elves, Orcs, Machine races, Tyranids (think Alien xenomoprhs), And traitor humans and demons from the realm of chaos (basically a dimension that originally harboured souls of the dead, but became overwhelmed by constant war and death in the galaxy that it is now a twisted dimension of chaos and evil) a dimension that leaks into ours, twisting and corrupting everything it touches.

You don't have to play the first game, but I absolutely advise it. There a more than a few references to it. It's a great game. This series is gonna be huge. So don't starve yourself of any backstory.

As for the gameplay, I suggest playing on normal, any higher and you lose that power fantasy feel and becomes kind of a chore to play. The level design is incredible, better than anything today, seeing the armies of humanity fighting this endless war in the background is incredible, tanks and apc's rolling around, it's so much fun to just watch. You'll really feel like you're playing an important role in this war. It will feel like it's unfolding in front of you. And the downtime on the ship in between mission is just icing on the cake.

It's expensive. But we need to support devs that remember what gaming is about. Appealing to their audience. Not mass appeal and micro transactions.

So, grab you're weapon brother, and get into the fray.

The Emperor protects!!!","我什至从哪里开始。不确定是谁开始谣言的，但是竞选活动不是6个小时。这是更长的时间。我在正常的难度上练习了14小时，并跳过了一半的侧面任务。我会说正常的16-17小时。这是一个很棒的游戏。男性化的化身。勾选所有盒子。兄弟情谊，呼吁更高的目标，善与恶。这是一个笨拙的游戏。它会使您体内的每个男性原子挠痒痒。这并不是说女性不会喜欢这个游戏，您会的，这只是意味着您是最终的坏蛋。

您不必在这里成为知识专家。我本人是一个休闲的战锤迷。我只知道基本知识。而且您也可以，YouTube上有许多1小时的视频可以阅读基础知识，并让您感到鼻烟。观看其中之一和您的完成。

但这是要点。

扮演由皇帝本人创造的7英尺高的超人人类士兵，一个太空海军陆战队。这是一个严峻的反乌托邦未来，人类在一场非常生存的银河战争中一直处于一场银河战争。一场无休止的银河战争。一场战争已经持续了数万年。A war against Elves, Orcs, Machine races, Tyranids (think Alien xenomoprhs), And traitor humans and demons from the realm of chaos (basically a dimension that originally harboured souls of the dead, but became overwhelmed by constant war and death in the galaxy现在，它是混乱和邪恶的扭曲维度，它泄漏到我们的层面，扭曲和破坏它所触及的一切。

您不必玩第一场比赛，但我绝对建议。有多个引用。这是一个很棒的游戏。这个系列将是巨大的。因此，不要饿死任何背景故事。

至于游戏玩法，我建议在正常情况下玩，任何人都会失去那种力量幻想的感觉，并变得有点繁琐。The level design is incredible, better than anything today, seeing the armies of humanity fighting this endless war in the background is incredible, tanks and apc's rolling around, it's so much fun to just watch.您真的会觉得自己在这场战争中扮演着重要角色。感觉就像在您面前展开。在任务之间的船上的停机时间只是在蛋糕上锦上添花。

这很昂贵。但是我们需要支持记住游戏的开发发展。吸引听众。不是大规模吸引力和微交易。

因此，抓住你是武器兄弟，进入竞争。

"I really want to love this game but as someone who's hugely into the Tide games by Fatshark I just don't think I can. It fails to capture the fantasy of being a space marine, in my opinion, and has multiple fundamental issues with its combat system. I think the simplest way to summarise it would be to say that it feels like I'm controlling a cumbersome vehicle that barely responds to my commands as opposed to a superpowered human being.

Skill issue, you might say? Well, no, not really. In fact, one of my main problems is that the (incredibly arbitrary, incidentally) blue parry indicator appears TOO EARLY and if you respond to it extremely promptly then you instead fail the parry and are punished rather than appropriately rewarded. This can be adjusted to, of course, but it feels terribly unintuitive.

That leads me to how only SOME attacks have audio cues and others don't... Why? Darktide has an audio cue for every melee attack made against you, and it feels great. Sound design in general isn't great here, with boltguns almost sounding like suppressed rifles. The gun strike mechanic also feels wildly inconsistent, and there's the lovely fact that your teammates can inadvertently prevent you from pulling these off.

But whiner, why do you keep making comparisons to Darktide? Well, I'd argue Darktide is the best 40k shooter available right now and I don't see any reason to buy this one while it exists unless you truly hate always online components or are one of those (boring... sorry) people who is specifically obsessed with space marines.

PvE operations difficulty is MASSIVELY inflated compared to the Normal mode of the campaign which I picked in the hopes of having a fun power fantasy experience. For the most part, the campaign does an OKAY job of achieving this despite the aforementioned issues - and has some amazing setpieces - but the starting operations difficulty is a mess. You are woefully underpowered for whatever reason and are expected to grind to achieve the physical power necessary to actually feel like a badass as opposed to a worthless chump.

Something is wrong when I feel infinitely more like a space marine in Darktide as my pathetic little stim addict almost-heretic on even the highest difficulty. I've not even mentioned how painfully unbalanced the Thousand Sons are compared to the tyranids. Inconsistency seems to be the name of this game.

I'm entirely unimpressed by the weapon variety seen here. Bolters, bolters and more bolters. Most of the ranged weapons are simply bolter variants, with a few exceptions, and then there's a grand total of four melee weapons. Rather pitiful compared to what's on offer in Darktide.

So, what about PvP? It feels totally slapped on to me. Melee has way less of an impact than I'd expect in a *Warhammer* game, the TTK is stupidly fast for what are supposed to be impressively durable supersoldiers, and I've (I'm NOT exaggerating) not played a single match that wasn't absurdly one-sided.

To me it feels as if they created the 6 - 10 hour ish campaign and then realized that releasing a shooter exclusively comprised of that doesn't exactly fly in the 2024 market for the price of $60; so what did they do? They cooked up a half-arsed PvP mode and a co-op PvE experience with an obnoxious progression system in the hopes of artificially extending playtime and creating the illusion of value. There's only minor enemy placement differences on each replay and no semblance of an AI director so content runs dry quick.

Sounds familiar, actually. A lot like World War Z by the same studio.

That value just isn't there for me, personally. I would pay maybe $30 just to experience the campaign which is visually breathtaking and full of cool moments, both narratively, and from the perspective of sheer rule of cool. But everything else? it's just mid, I think.

Frankly, I don't understand why Darktide was so lambasted for its launch when this game suffers from the same issues of a lack of content, poor optimization and crappy weapons that take forever to tune and actually feel solid. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I really can't find the appeal.","我真的很想喜欢这款游戏，但是作为Fatshark的潮汐游戏，我只是认为我不能。在我看来，它无法捕捉成为太空海军陆战队的幻想，并且在其战斗系统中存在多个基本问题。我认为总结的最简单方法是说，感觉就像我正在控制一辆笨拙的车辆，该车辆几乎无法响应我的命令，而不是超级能力的人。

技能问题，您可能会说吗？好吧，不，不是。实际上，我的主要问题之一是（非常任意的，顺便说一句）蓝帕里指标（Blue Parry）的指标出现得为时过早，如果您对此做出的反应非常迅速，那么您将失败，而不是惩罚而不是得到适当的奖励。当然，这可以调整为，但感觉非常不直觉。

这使我了解到只有一些攻击才有音频提示，而另一些则没有...为什么？Darktide对您的每一次近战攻击都有音频提示，感觉很棒。总体而言，声音设计并不是很棒，螺栓几乎听起来像是被抑制的步枪。枪击机械师也感到非常不一致，而且您的队友可以无意中阻止您将其拉开。

但是Whiner，为什么您要继续与Darktide进行比较？好吧，我认为Darktide是目前最好的40k射击游戏，除非您真正讨厌总是在线组件，否特别着迷于太空海军陆战队的人。

与我选择的正常运动模式相比，PVE操作难度大大膨胀，以期获得有趣的力量幻想体验。在大多数情况下，尽管存在上述问题，但该活动在实现这一目标方面做得很好 - 并且有一些惊人的设置 - 但起始操作困难是一团糟。无论出于何种原因，您都会造成不足的能力，并有望磨碎以实现真正感觉像是坏蛋所必需的物理力量，而不是毫无价值的笨蛋。

当我无限地感觉到Darktide中的太空海军陆战队时，我的可悲小刺激成瘾者几乎在最高的困难上几乎是个histeric，这是错误的。我什至没有提到与霸王相比，千分之一的儿子是多么痛苦的不平衡。不一致似乎是该游戏的名称。

我对这里看到的武器的多样性完全没有印象。螺栓，挥舞器和更多的螺栓器。大多数远程武器只是螺栓变种，除了少数例外，然后总共有四种近战武器。与Darktide提供的内容相比，相当可怜。

那么，PVP呢？感觉完全被我拍了拍。近战的影响少于我在 *战锤 *游戏中的预期，TTK对于应该是令人印象深刻耐用的超级义士的愚蠢的，我（我没有夸张）没有参加过一场比赛那不是单方面的荒谬。

对我来说，感觉好像他们创建了6-10个小时的ISH活动，然后意识到，仅在2024年市场上以60美元的价格释放了一个仅在2024年市场中完全飞行的射手；那他们做了什么？他们烹饪了半射的PVP模式，并具有令人讨厌的进步系统的合作PVE体验，以期人为地延长游戏时间并创造价值的错觉。每个重播的敌人位置差异只有小，AI导演的外表差异很快，因此内容很快就会干燥。

实际上，听起来很熟悉。很像同一个工作室的世界大战。

就我个人而言，这个价值不是在我身边。我可能会付30美元，只是为了体验这场运动，这在视觉上令人叹为观止，叙事上充满了凉爽的时刻，也是从纯粹的酷统治的角度来看。但是其他一切呢？我认为这只是中期。

坦率地说，我不明白为什么Darktide遭受了与缺乏内容，差优化和糟糕的武器相同的问题的束缚，而这种武器会永远调整并实际上感觉很扎实。我觉得我正在服用疯狂的药。我真的找不到上诉。",-0.9929,"{'Nickname': 'Haywire Hayley', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '17.9', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/id/haywirehayley/', 'Comment': ""I really want to love this game but as someone who's hugely into the Tide games by Fatshark I just don't think I can.

"The game is good, not incredible but it was never its goal.
Why don't I recommend it then?
The campaign is not exceptional and is quite short, a bit of a shame for a game that is above all solo, say ... 9 am the countryside is finished.

How to justify the price then?
Well, the multiplayer that is ... passable ...
The PVE mode which is actually the most original thing has only 6 different missions which is really a shame.
The progression system is correct but a little too long for my taste.
No possibility of creating a private part and above all, you will leave games, there are 6 classes and no duplicates.
Basically you will pray that nobody already has pick the class you want.
It's already really boring, but the matchmaking had to be simply nonexistent, there is justn't one.
You will often join a game that has already started without the possibility of choosing it or not, and in addition you will often be kick for x or y raion, in short it is frustrating.

The gameplay itself now.
A classic TPS, in reality quite disappointing for a Wh40K game, the feeling of weapons is not there, there are a total of fifteen weapons I would say, but in reality only a few are viable, we will pass the miles and one variantunnecessary bolter.
The bolter elsewhere, let's talk about it, he just does not do any damage, forced to empty a charger of 45 strokes to kill a basic monster, with a total of only 5 chargers ...
You see the problem coming, we find ourselves almost all the time short of ammunition, which greatly breaks the fun.
The body to hand now, on my side, I will say that it passes but it is far from fun to play, unlike sm1 here no regen of life and impossible to cancel in blow, in short, you will only playWith 90% of the time parades because CàC is just not a viable option since the mobs explode you at CàC.
The capacities of the classes which are but then not fun at all outside the standard, and the talent tree which is not really one, it is just passive which unlocks as you goBut which changes absolutely nothing at the gameplay.
In style, your main weapon inflicts 10% additional damage ... Far but then very far from class customization as in the Darktide which is however quite simple.
We are far from what a deep rock can offer with the overclocks that are ultra fun.

Special negative mention for waves of enemies, I explain myself, in each mission we have a phase where we must defend a place against waves of enemies, except that, unlike a World War Z where it is satisfactory becauseThe zombies arrive in a few paths, here the monsters come absolutely everywhere, we are almost instantly at CàC, there is no defense line and it is ultra frustrating.

In summary, SP2 is a good game, but far from satisfactory, I do not feel the fun that a Darktide can provide for a game that is a swarm shooter.Very quickly repetitive and accumulated with a fairly flat gameplay we quickly get pissed off.
I obviously only cited the negative points for me, although there were things that I appreciated in style animation or personalization in terms of appearance, it is clearly not enough for goodNoted the game.","游戏很好，并不令人难以置信，但这从来都不是它的目标。
那我为什么不推荐它呢？
该活动并不例外，很短，对于最重要的游戏来说，有点可耻，例如……上午9点，乡村完成了。

那么如何证明价格合理？
好吧，是...可通过的多人游戏...
实际上最原始的PVE模式只有6个不同的任务，这确实是一种耻辱。
进度系统是正确的，但我的口味太长了。
不可能创建私人部分，最重要的是，您将离开游戏，有6堂课，没有重复。
基本上，您会祈祷没有人已经选择了您想要的课。
这确实很无聊，但是对接必须简单地存在，只是没有一个。
您通常会加入一款已经开始的游戏而没有选择它的可能性，此外，您通常会踢X或Y Raion，简而言之，它令人沮丧。

游戏本身。
经典的TPS，实际上对WH40K游戏非常令人失望，武器的感觉不存在，我总共有15种武器，但实际上只有少数武器可行。
在其他地方的堡垒，让我们谈论它，他只是没有造成任何损害，被迫空着45杆的充电器来杀死一个基本的怪物，总共只有5个充电器...
您会看到问题来了，我们几乎一直都在弹药中发现自己，这极大地打破了乐趣。
我现在要交手的身体，我会说它过去了，但玩远非很有趣，与SM1不同，没有生命的再生，不可能在打击中取消，简而言之，您只会播放90％的90％时间游行是因为Càc只是一个可行的选择，因为暴民在Càc爆炸了您。
班级的能力，但在标准之外并不有趣，而不是真正的人才树，这只是被动的，它会随着您的gobut打解锁，这在游戏玩法中绝对没有任何变化。
在风格上，您的主要武器会造成10％的额外伤害...远离类别的定制，就像在Darktide中一样，这很简单。
我们距离深岩的超频能够提供超级乐趣。

我自己解释说，在每个任务中，我们都有一个对敌人的浪潮的特别负面提及，我们有一个阶段，我们必须为敌人的浪潮辩护，除了与第一次世界大战不同的是，这是令人满意的，因为僵尸陷入了几条途径，在这里，怪物绝对到处都是，我们几乎立即在Càc，没有防御线，这是非常令人沮丧的。

总而言之，SP2是一款不错的游戏，但远非令人满意，我并不感到Darktide可以为群体射击游戏提供游戏的乐趣。非常快速地重复，并以相当平坦的游戏玩法积累了我们很快就会生气。

PVP is felt quite balanced, but I played only 5 matches, so that my opinion can be false.

Very well -polished game, from the bugs that I met in 130 hours of game:
1) the inability to shoot/interact with anything until you press the change of weapons-it occurs once every 6-10 hours of gameplay and arises either independently during resurrection, or when joining someone in the game

3) reset cd weapons if you change to primary/secondary

5) a leviting player can be very rare

The main disadvantages of the game:
1) It is very undesirable to play alone, play at least with randomes, in the worst case they will do as much as the bot.The bots are extremely stupid and the maximum at that they are suitable to throw a grenade every 5 minutes and not die so as to rescue the players and it happens that they stand up and freeze.The complexity of 3-4 solo, without completely bitten weapons and class, without choosing equipment and perks for the mission, is extremely difficult to go through.
2) Optimization in the game is lame, 3080 on ultras gives out 40-60 FPS, only DLSS on the balance sheet or below saves the situation.At the very beginning, even the game could not be launched further than the first cut-scene due to the fact that the game was on HDD, not SSD.

5) a strange solution with impenetrable textures.On the first mission, if you meet a flying enemy, you will notice how shooting at the leaves, the bolts will not pass through and you will spend the cartridges in vain.Sometimes there will be situations with opponents that they cause reinforcements standing behind the textures of the railing and you will not be able to shoot them and knock down the call.

"So 80 Hours in this game features 3 distinct parts.


TLDR: game looks and sounds great, very true to source material

campaign story is decent but nothing to write home about. great spectical but obviously parts were cut from it. maybe not enough time, still good fun, specially in coop.

PVE mode 3 player coop in style of darktide, L4F etc, has a lot of meat to sink your teeth into, customisation, leveling etc.

PVP more 6vs6 with 3 game modes and 3 maps. fun but lacking a lot of content and is a 2010 style shooter.

BUY if you like the PVE or PVP campaign is not worth the full price

LONG VERSION

outside of PVP the gameplay is a 3rd person shooter where you can often run out of ammo but that where melee comes in. this has a whole melee system with attack combos, blocking parrying, doging in it. kind of like the lastes god of war games. if you take damage you lose armor which regenerates after 30 seconds or you can execute enemies to get some back. when out or armor you loose health which you can get back by doing damage a short time after taking it. like in bloodbourne. if you miss that short mindow there are me packs that restore some health and some classes can get health back r hel other with it.

so now you run around and 20 small enemies + a handfull elites leading them show up. you shoot and melee the hell out of them taking damage, regenerating armour by executing which also give you i-frames. blocking, doging parrying etc. with enough pratice it becomes a dance of death. which can be really fun when you get into ""the flowstate"" of the combat.

a single player campaign:
playable with up to 3 players in coop. this is the main story. features no progression or leveling or armor customisation. the story is and plot is ok. nothing fancy but servicable. in terms of looks and sound its great though. bombastic and warhammer as hell. depending on your difficulty you will play this for about 8-10 hours. good for one playthough but thats it. there are a lot of shooters that deliver a better story. but the spectacle is here.

adjacent to the campaign is the operations mode:

you play 3 marines can choose from 6 diffent classes featuring unique skills and skill trees ofthen even unique weapons. you play 3 player coop missions kind of like darktide, left 4 dead etc. with a director that keeps thing fresh and sets up enemy spawns etc.

this mode features full leveling of weapons and classes with skill trees with 4 difficulty levels. this is where i spend 90% of my playtime. leveling different classes and their weapons earning ingame currency to buy their gear and customize their armor look from the 9 loyalist legions + a plethora of 1st and second founding astartes chapters. armor visual customization looks really good. in this mode i have arnound 60-70 hours and have maxed 4 of the 6 classes but often just a handfull of their available weapons.


next is the 6vs6 pvp modes, it is disconnected from the other modes in terms of progression and although you have the same classes some skills are slightly different and you only unlock weapon loadouts & cosmetics. there are no skilltrees or weapon skill trees. you also earn ingamemoney you can use in the operations mode to unlock new cosmetics and weapons.

you play loyalist vs traitors while for loyalist you can customize way the traitors models are locked in in terms of model but you can customize colors & emblems. so for example the vanguard is always a world eater, the heavy always death guard. but you can color them differently.

3 game modes, deathmatch, domination and capture and hold. on only 3 maps.
the game modes are fine, the maps are fine but it is all very COD 2010. spawncamping can easily happen. matchmaking isnt great. the melee system is gutted compared to pve modes, you can parry and block but besides negating damage but you dont get an advantage for it over the enemy. thoug melee ignores armor. besides that you regenerate armor faster than in pve and even heal quite fast.
it is fun but has its problems lacking content and using dated mechanics.

still very fun game and if you play the PVE coop mode or enjoy the PVP you can get a lot of hours out of it.
if you are only here for the campaign. better way for a sale.","因此，该游戏中的80小时具有3个不同的部分。


TLDR：游戏的外观和听起来很棒，非常适合来源材料

竞选故事很不错，但没有什么可写的。非常明显但显然是从中切开的。也许没有足够的时间，仍然很有趣，特别是在库库中。

PVE Mode 3 Darktide，L4F等风格的玩家鸡舍有很多肉可以将您的牙齿沉入，定制，平整等。

PVP更多6VS6，带有3个游戏模式和3幅地图。有趣但缺乏很多内容，并且是2010年风格的射手。

购买如果您喜欢PVE或PVP广告系列不值得全价

长版

在PVP之外，游戏玩法是第三人称射击游戏，您通常可以用尽弹药，但是近战进出。这具有整个近战系统，带有攻击组合，阻止了招架，并在其中进行了教。有点像持久的战神游戏。如果您受到伤害，则会失去30秒后再生的装甲，或者可以执行敌人以取回一些。出门或盔甲时，您会在服用后短时间内造成损坏而恢复健康。就像在血腥的一样。如果您想念那个简短的Mindow，那么我的包装可以恢复一些健康，而有些课程可以使其他人恢复健康。

因此，现在您四处奔走，有20个小敌人 +一个带领他们的少量精英出现。您通过执行枪击，使他们遭受伤害，再生装甲的地狱，这也给您带来了i框架。阻止，do养育招架等。用足够的pratice变成了死亡的舞蹈。当您进入战斗的“流州”时，这真的很有趣。

单人运动：
可在Coop中最多可玩3位球员。这是主要故事。没有进展，平整或装甲定制。故事是，情节还可以。除了有用的东西，别无选择。从外观和听起来很棒的角度来看。轰炸和战锤作为地狱。根据您的困难，您将玩大约8-10个小时。很好，尽管如此，但这就是这样。有很多射击者提供更好的故事。但是奇观就在这里。

该活动毗邻的是操作模式：

您玩3名海军陆战队可以从6个不同的课程中进行选择，这些课程具有独特的技能和技能树，甚至是独特的武器。您扮演3个玩家库库任务，例如Darktide，剩下的4人死亡等。导演保持新鲜并设置敌人产卵等。

这种模式具有具有4个难度水平的技能树的武器和课程的完整级别。这是我花费90％的游戏时间的地方。将不同的班级和武器级别级别，以购买Ingame货币购买装备，并从9个忠诚主义者的军团 +众多的第一和第二个创始Astartes章节中定制外观。装甲视觉定制看起来真的很好。在这种模式下，我有60-70个小时的纵梁，并且在6堂课中最多只有4个，但通常只有少数可用的武器。


接下来是6VS6 PVP模式，它在进度方面与其他模式断开了连接，尽管您拥有相同的类别，但某些技能略有不同，并且仅解锁了武器负载和化妆品。没有技能树或武器技能树。您还可以在操作模式下使用Ingamemoney，以解锁新的化妆品和武器。

您会扮演忠诚主义者与叛徒，而对于忠诚主义者，您可以自定义叛徒模型在模型中锁定的方式，但您可以自定义颜色和标志。因此，例如，先锋队始终是一个世界食者，是沉重的死亡卫队。但是，您可以对它们进行不同的颜色。

3种游戏模式，死亡竞赛，统治和捕获和保持。仅在3幅地图上。
游戏模式很好，地图很好，但这都是COD 2010。搭配不是很好。与PVE模式相比，近战系统被污染了，您可以烤制和阻塞，但除了否定损害之外，您对敌人没有优势。Thoug Meree忽略了装甲。除此之外，您还要比PVE更快地再生装甲，甚至快速愈合。
这很有趣，但缺乏内容并使用过时的力学问题。

仍然非常有趣的游戏，如果您玩PVE Coop模式或享受PVP，则可以从中获得很多小时。
如果您仅在这里参加活动。销售的更好方法。",-0.9902,"{'Nickname': 'Die Happy', 'Title': '1', 'Play Hours': '129.5', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/id/die_happy/', 'Comment': 'So 80 Hours in this game features 3 distinct parts.\n\n\nTLDR: game looks and sounds great, very true to source material\n\ncampaign story is decent but nothing to write home about. great spectical but obviously parts were cut from it. maybe not enough time, still good fun, specially in coop.\n\nPVE mode 3 player coop in style of darktide, L4F etc, has a lot of meat to sink your teeth into, customisation, leveling etc.\n\nPVP more 6vs6 with 3 game modes and 3 maps. fun but lacking a lot of content and is a 2010 style shooter.\n\nBUY if you like the PVE or PVP campaign is not worth the full price\n\nLONG VERSION\n\noutside of PVP the gameplay is a 3rd person shooter where you can often run out of ammo but that where melee comes in. this has a whole melee system with attack combos, blocking parrying, doging in it. kind of like the lastes god of war games. if you take damage you lose armor which regenerates after 30 seconds or you can execute enemies to get some back. when out or armor you loose health which you can get back by doing damage a short time after taking it. like in bloodbourne. if you miss that short mindow there are me packs that restore some health and some classes can get health back r hel other with it.\n\nso now you run around and 20 small enemies + a handfull elites leading them show up. you shoot and melee the hell out of them taking damage, regenerating armour by executing which also give you i-frames. blocking, doging parrying etc. with enough pratice it becomes a dance of death. which can be really fun when you get into ""the flowstate"" of the combat.\n\na single player campaign:\nplayable with up to 3 players in coop. this is the main story. features no progression or leveling or armor customisation. the story is and plot is ok. nothing fancy but servicable. in terms of looks and sound its great though. bombastic and warhammer as hell. depending on your difficulty you will play this for about 8-10 hours. good for one playthough but thats it. there are a lot of shooters that deliver a better story. but the spectacle is here.\n\nadjacent to the campaign is the operations mode:\n\nyou play 3 marines can choose from 6 diffent classes featuring unique skills and skill trees ofthen even unique weapons. you play 3 player coop missions kind of like darktide, left 4 dead etc. with a director that keeps thing fresh and sets up enemy spawns etc.\n\nthis mode features full leveling of weapons and classes with skill trees with 4 difficulty levels. this is where i spend 90% of my playtime. leveling different classes and their weapons earning ingame currency to buy their gear and customize their armor look from the 9 loyalist legions + a plethora of 1st and second founding astartes chapters. armor visual customization looks really good. in this mode i have arnound 60-70 hours and have maxed 4 of the 6 classes but often just a handfull of their available weapons.\n\n\nnext is the 6vs6 pvp modes, it is disconnected from the other modes in terms of progression and although you have the same classes some skills are slightly different and you only unlock weapon loadouts & cosmetics. there are no skilltrees or weapon skill trees. you also earn ingamemoney you can use in the operations mode to unlock new cosmetics and weapons.\n\nyou play loyalist vs traitors while for loyalist you can customize way the traitors models are locked in in terms of model but you can customize colors & emblems. so for example the vanguard is always a world eater, the heavy always death guard. but you can color them differently.\n\n3 game modes, deathmatch, domination and capture and hold. on only 3 maps.\nthe game modes are fine, the maps are fine but it is all very COD 2010. spawncamping can easily happen. matchmaking isnt great. the melee system is gutted compared to pve modes, you can parry and block but besides negating damage but you dont get an advantage for it over the enemy. thoug melee ignores armor. besides that you regenerate armor faster than in pve and even heal quite fast.\nit is fun but has its problems lacking content and using dated mechanics.\n\nstill very fun game and if you play the PVE coop mode or enjoy the PVP you can get a lot of hours out of it.\nif you are only here for the campaign. better way for a sale.', 'Date': '2024/9/16', 'Language': 'en'}",Success
"Summary: Non -fans only buy the standard version of the minimum difficulty. The battle for single players is good. It is recommended to discount, because it is not worth the price.

The single -player battle is indeed cool, without numerical growth, and no professional restrictions.The appearance can be limited. At present, only the right shoulder armor and two weapon skin can be used in single -player campaign.

Many people have serious balance issues. As soon as the PVP is smashed, a quasi -PVE finds this.I will not say much about my PVP.The PVE weapon value has a paradoxic paradox. Gold guns have to fight the highest difficulty but it is difficult to hit the highest difficulty ... Only professional talents and appearance painting can be used to be full.In addition, this game season ticket is only qualified for you. The content itself is all coated with appearance, and you must buy it by your own liver gold coins.The benefit is that at least you have nothing to do with the strength (laughs).

Compared with the first generation, the role performance does not retreat. There are too many negative feedback in the level of the level of the PVE wasteland. The key talent of many occupations to change the game experience is too late. The role performance is not growing.return.The resources of ammunition packages are short of resources, but the enemy has various bullying dogs. The melee can block the bullets but the blood volume of the enemy group evaporates instantly.The firearms other than the hot -hanging grenade of the hot melt and the grenades can not make the enemy hard, and interrupting the enemy's behavior is the most critical factor for survival in the game. This has led to most weapons.The charging laser has become a special attack on BOSS because of numerical supermodels.At present, the status quo of PVE is not that a certain weapon is easy to use, but it cannot be played without a certain minority installation.

In terms of network, the country is difficult to use, and the accelerator may not be used, and the online system is very stupid. There is almost no abnormal self -test. The drop must return to the title interface to register.Once you are interrupted with the homeowner during the matching phase, at least you need to switch the single -player mode before cutting back to the strange machine soul soothing ceremony. Otherwise, you will match the air rotation again, and you will not wait for teammates for 40,000 years.

单人战斗确实很酷，没有数值增长，也没有专业限制。外观可以受到限制。目前，只有右肩装甲和两种武器皮肤才能在单人运动中使用。

许多人有严重的平衡问题。一旦PVP被粉碎，准PVE就会发现这一点。我不会对我的PVP说太多。PVE武器的价值具有悖论性的悖论。金枪必须与最高的困难作斗争，但很难打出最高的困难……只有专业才能和外观绘画才能充满。此外，此游戏季票仅适合您。内容本身都涂有外观，您必须通过自己的肝脏金币购买。好处是，至少您与力量无关（笑）。

与第一代相比，角色绩效不会退缩。在PVE荒原级别的水平上有太多的负面反馈。改变游戏体验的许多职业的关键才能为时已晚。角色绩效并没有增长。返回。弹药包的资源缺乏资源，但敌人有各种各样的欺凌狗。近战可以阻止子弹，但敌人群体的血液量立即蒸发。除了热熔体和手榴弹的热悬挂手榴弹以外的枪支不能使敌人变得坚硬，而打断敌人的行为是最关键的因素在游戏中生存。这导致了大多数武器。由于数字超模，充电激光已成为对老板的特殊攻击。在目前，PVE的现状并不是说某种武器易于使用，但没有某种少数族裔就无法使用安装。

就网络而言，该国难以使用，并且可能不使用加速器，并且在线系统非常愚蠢。几乎没有异常的自我检验。下降必须返回标题接口才能注册。一旦您在匹配阶段被房主打断，至少您需要切换单个玩家模式，然后再缩短到奇怪的机器灵魂舒缓仪式。否则，您将再次匹配空中轮换，并且您将不再等待队友40，000年。

通常，此游戏中的单人游戏活动的音量不足。多人的生长曲线很陡峭，新的时期很短，反性形状相同，获得积极反馈的成本很高，研究的时间和深度非常浅。",-0.9892,"{'Nickname': 'ZTyoho', 'Title': '0', 'Play Hours': '57.8', 'Profile Link': 'https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198201426425/', 'Comment': ""Summary: Non -fans only buy the standard version of the minimum difficulty.

1. The plug -in of PVP still exists. The little lazy bear has not played any effective effect, but now it has become rare as the number of online people decreases.
2. PVE's low -character performance, such as the shield of paper paste that will disappear by the shield that will be interrupted, rolling without invincible frames, the mobs are caught twice.It also determines that failure, barrels and warriors, etc., can make players hard straight, etc.
3. The difficulty setting of the PVE is unreasonable.

4. There are too few PVE content, there are only six maps, and the high difficulty is basically only a specific two pictures.

场景艺术的设计和星际战士都非常适合战锤40k的风格。对于拥有40k Warmers 40k的粉丝来说，这可能是最圆圈和战争锤40k IP杰作的数量。

但是这个游戏的缺点也很明显：
1。PVP的插头仍然存在。小懒惰的熊没有发挥任何有效的效果，但是随着在线人员的数量减少，现在变得罕见。
2。PVE的低特征性能，例如将被打断的盾牌消失的纸糊，无敌框架滚动，暴民被抓到两次。可以使玩家变得坚硬，等等。
3。PVE的难度设置是不合理的。为了增加N3和N4的难度，实际上是增加怪物价值并大大减少供应次数的粗鲁倍数。位置，有时团队组成主要是在近战的情况下，并且是被迫直接逃脱；但是，官方宣布表示，将来将降低怪物的价值。
4。PVE内容太少，只有六个地图，而高难度基本上只是特定的两张图片。

"The plot campaign is 8 \ 10, a huge minus is the final bossfight, about it at the end without spoilers and under a small spoiler.
There is no point in talking about the advantages, everyone has already seen everything according to the trailers that she looks amazing on all fronts and this is really so, but, several fronts managed to lose.
For those who are going to play the difficulties of the ""Death Angel"", it is not worth it, just because of the combat system.Constantly lacking first -aid kits and without deaths, even with all the dexterity, it will simply be impossible:

1. Due to the incredibly well-aimed enemies that are pixels through tiny pixels, some enemies will be spaced with very strong attacks, such attacks are not blocked in the rifts / evasion / retorting or you either accept fate, or have managed to hide.Of course, there are two cells of the armor, but they are demolished every second even after finishing up if you are in a heap of enemies who boil around and attack who.
One could still resolve the question if the finishing of special enemies added health, but it does not add and finishing special enemies gives exactly the same as the usual ordinary beetle - a cell of armor, which will be immediately played.
2. AI allies when playing without friends are simply unbearably dumb.They finish off the opponents when it is not necessary, when you yourself are running to finish, or do not finish off at all while you are busy with other enemies at the other end of the arena, he leaves the condition and continues to beat you.
They decide to raise you for half a year, even if their boots stand right on your head, they wait for the drum, wait and rest.They inflict damage and even help to kill, but 99% of the arena is cleaned precisely by the player, with due good luck they will help 5 percent more than usual.
It is clear that they don’t need to give them for the player, but help in such conditions could have provided, at least the first -aid kits would have been thrown out of nowhere during the very harsh conditions of the battle.
AI promise to correct in the nearest patch, but so far it is like this.

The difficulty could be excellent and sane, if not for these disadvantages that spoil the impression of passage.Not critical, but it would be comfortable playing on a veteran, if you want to not only crush, but the difficulty bites slightly.And there are no achievements for the angel of death, you can start on any comfortable.

Final bossfite.Refers only to the complexity of the ""Angel of Death"".
Well, this is some kind of nightmare.Firstly, it is very, very protracted and not without turning the boss into a regular sponge for damage.Secondly, due to the fact that the camera is not in the center of complexity with some attacks, and there is a lot of damage.So from some point, the boss begins to rush strictly in all directions and make noise, and the readability of attacks occurs in the color of the blow and the sound that it is about to be applied.","情节运动是8 \ 10，巨大的负责人是最终的老板战斗，最终没有破坏者和小小的破坏者。
谈论优势是没有意义的，每个人都根据预告片看到了一切，她在所有方面都看起来很棒，但确实如此，但是，有几个战线设法输了。
对于那些要扮演“死亡天使”困难的人来说，这是不值得的，仅仅是因为战斗系统。都缺乏第一个辅助工具包，即使没有死亡，也没有任何敏捷性，这根本不可能是不可能的：

1。由于令人难以置信的好敌人，这些敌人是像素通过微小像素的像素，一些敌人将受到非常强烈的攻击，因此这种攻击不会在裂痕 /逃避 /逃避 /反驳中被阻止，或者您接受命运，或者已经设法隐藏了。
是否可以解决特殊敌人的饰面，但它仍然可以解决一个问题，但它不会增加和完成特殊敌人的效果与通常的普通甲虫完全相同 - 一种将立即播放的装甲牢房。
2。没有朋友玩耍时的AI盟友简直令人难以置信的愚蠢。当您没有必要时，当您自己跑步以完成或在另一端忙于其他敌人时，他们就结束了对手在舞台上，他离开了病情，继续击败你。
他们决定抚养您半年玩家，祝您好运，他们将比平常多帮助5％。
显然，他们不需要给球员，但是在这种情况下的帮助，至少在战斗的严峻条件下，至少第一个援助套件本来可以抛弃。
AI承诺在最近的补丁中纠正，但到目前为止是这样。

难度可能是极好而理智的，如果不是因为这些缺点会破坏通道的印象，这不是至关重要的，但是如果您不仅要粉碎，而且很难咬，而且有些困难，而且有些困难对于死亡天使没有任何成就，您可以从任何舒适的人开始。

"Unless it is a loyal fan of the Warhammer 40K series, it is not recommended.
The kernel is actually the set of zombie world war.

As an Astert, players have low speed, low blood volume, low melee damage (need to be continuously stigmatized and straight enemies will be beaten), low gear returns (need to upgrade weapons), protectThe shield is low, and the shield has a long reply time (the time is re -calculated by the remote enemy, basically rely on the execution of the enemy to reply to the shield) remote weapon bullets, the full series of shotguns scrape one shuttle, a small elite, a sniper rifle, a sniper rifleThe damage was also low before the full level. Only the hot melting gun was a little intensity (only 3 occupations had this type of weapon).

The first content of 7 campaigns+6 action modes+PVP mode

The battle mode and action mode are divided into four difficulties. Novice suggests to play the lowest difficulty or ordinary difficulty.

7 battles (invited friends to play together) are full, well-made, 5-8h.

The PVP mode is only EAC's anti -cheating. It has been occupied by plug -ins. It is not recommended to play before rectifying the environment.

After the player finished playing 6 levels of the action mode, after freshness, the focus came.

If you want to experience high difficulty, you need a large amount of duration to improve the character level and weapon level, otherwise there is no gaming experience.
The experience value of the character upgrade is linked to the difficulty, low difficulty experience, and low -level characters cannot be played at all when high -level characters are not as high as high -level characters.
Weapon experience can get the highest -level weapon at least 20 times to get the highest -level weapon (each weapon needs to be brushed like this), and each weapon also needs a lot of materials to upgrade (one level can only pick up to get one material, and the BOSS can get additional to get additional obtainedone).
After clearing all 6 cooperation model levels, after reading the plot, in order to quickly improve the player's level and weapons, they basically captured the same level to repeat the running drawing brush, full of boring.(If anyone thinks repeating the same level, it is interesting, so I can only indicate that you are right)

The standard version can experience all the game content. The luxury version only has the color and pattern of the skin (the standard version can also unlock the color changes and patterns, but there are no luxury version).You can get it, but the amount of gain is very small). The ultimate additional skin has only one occupation.The armor model (note that the model is not the color) can be unlocked by just playing a certain number of times, no need to buy DLC.

As an ultimate version of grievances, my suggestion is: If you have the idea of ​​buying, it is recommended to buy the standard version and experience the plot of the battle and cooperation model (about 12-15H). Ordinary players do not need to rigid liver character level.","除非它是战锤40k系列的忠实粉丝，否则不建议这样做。
内核实际上是僵尸世界大战的集合。

作为一个阿斯特特，玩家的速度低，血液量低，近战损害低（需要连续受到污名和直敌人），低齿轮回报率（需要升级武器），保护屏蔽率很低，盾牌具有很长的回复时间（时间是由偏远敌人重新计算的，基本上依靠敌人的执行来回复盾牌）远程武器子弹，一系列shot弹枪刮擦一班车，一个小精英，一只小精英，狙击步枪，在整个水平之前，狙击手步枪的伤害也很低。只有热融化的枪有点强度（只有3个职业具有这种武器）。

7个活动的第一个内容+6个动作模式+PVP模式

战斗模式和动作模式分为四个困难。新手建议扮演最低的难度或普通难度。

7次战斗（邀请朋友一起玩）是完整的，精心制作的5-8H。

PVP模式仅是EAC的反治疗。它已被插头占据。不建议在纠正环境之前玩。

在玩家完成6个动作模式的级别之后，焦点就到了。

如果您想经历高度的困难，则需要大量持续时间来提高角色水平和武器水平，否则就没有游戏体验。
角色升级的体验价值与难度，低难度经验以及低级别的字符相关，而高级别的角色不如高级别的字符高。
武器体验至少可以获得最高的武器20次以获得最高的武器（每个武器都需要像这样刷牙），并且每种武器还需要大量材料来升级（一个级别只能达到获取一种材料，老板可以得到更多的材料，以获取额外的获得酮）。
在清除了所有6个合作模型级别之后，阅读了绘图后，以快速提高玩家的水平和武器，他们基本上捕获了相同的水平，以重复运行的绘图刷，充满无聊。（如果有人认为重复相同的水平，这很有趣，所以我只能表明你是对的）

标准版本可以体验所有游戏内容。豪华版本只有皮肤的颜色和图案（标准版本也可以解锁颜色变化和图案，但没有豪华版本）。您可以得到它，但是增益的量很小）。终极额外的皮肤只有一个职业。装甲模型（请注意，模型不是颜色）可以通过玩一定数量的次数来解锁，而无需购买DLC。

"Update: Monk friendship, excellent!Congratulations to the hammer.The update has not been comfortable to return to the distinguished single in a few days, it's great!

The assault and sniper must be forced to fight, and it is exciting to think about it.
N5 is more outrageous remote damage than previous N4.
And the more outrageous special refresh (two Licat+two brain insects in a small space), and you also forced you to hold a group sticker.
The current N5 three people are basically dissatisfied with the editor.
Your teammates are kneeling, and you don't have to wait for your teammates to directly push the map to directly kneel.
You are waiting for your teammates for more than 200 seconds, and the probability of brushing more brain insects and Licat is high.You are afraid of three Licat.
Bullets are often empty, and the two spiritual encephaloses cooperate with Licat to attack and brush the BOSS.
Not only that, under the difficulty of N4, the probability of multiple spiritual encephaloshims at the same time has greatly increased, which is more fleshy than before.

Give you the handle, you come.

A PVE game is actually so cool that the player brushes, a powerful NERF player.

Generally, such difficulties will not be designed.
The general shake pen does not have such a red stone.

---

At present, the game content is scarce and lacking.

As a game that focuses on PVE, the reward mechanism of the game is a bit outrageous.You can only obtain experience through chapter nodes and complete task goals.
However, the monster refresh during the task is random, so it will appear. Maybe you can go to the final node in a certain game; three brain insects appear in a certain game (of course, the refresh of the brain insect is not ending, it is impossible to end.Where it cannot be killed).
Taking the 1st Purgatory as an example, you may only defend the generator once in the 钷 refinery area to enter the next area. It may also be a four -generator in the next four guards to repair the crane machine, and finally brush a special enemy, such as a knife, such as a knife, such as a knifeAx.Remember that the experience mentioned earlier is only through the chapter nodes and the complete chapter task goals.Then in the first case, you have no additional rewards at all in the first case through the purgatory refining plant, and in the second case.

Secondly, the current game balance is very bad, a large number of hot -melt people.In addition to the combat style, the melee can play a little bit, and the other two styles are very eaten.Don't get close to the extremely low kill efficiency.

When single players are playing, the backplane of your map is almost the same. It is also stupid to wait for the AI ​​transmission in front of the control panel. Can't you consider doing it? Do you directly unlock the control panel without one player?
The same constipation experience is that I have to wait for the end of the conversation to interact with the task element.As for the current content, you need to hit it a few times. Where is the task interaction point? The monsters are refreshed there.

It is also necessary to specifically criticize the current online connection matching mechanism. The progress of offline play is not preserved. I can understand it to prevent cheating.However, it seems that the effect is very effective at present.
At present, I have a very unfriendly experience of the unique wolf player. I have encountered more than one time to match the task matching for 5 minutes and did not match.Single people open the task, hit the final task node, stuck, and then the task has 80%-90%. In this case, you should not use me as a host to give meDo you come to match me? Do you develop the game you do n’t play?

I have to mention some other places with poor experiences, such as currently existing and high -frequency -ended animation lenses with messy bugs.There are also Pioneer Claws inconsistent with the PVE and PVP experience.It is difficult to not doubt whether it is because of the judgment of the unable to deal with the unable to handle hook claws in the complex environment of the PVE, so simply prevent you from using hook claws in PVE to interact with the environment?

Finally, in 2024, this game is also a loading simulator.Combined with the high blood pressure transfer host mentioned above, the host leaves, unlimited loading, very good.

It is not an IP fan. It is not recommended to buy without fixed teammates.
Friends who really look at PVE are recommended to try DRG Deep Rock Galaxy.","更新：和尚友谊，很棒！恭喜锤子。更新在几天内重返杰出单曲并不舒服，这太好了！

攻击和狙击手必须被迫战斗，考虑一下这真是令人兴奋。
N5比以前的N4更令人发指。
而且，更令人发指的特殊刷新（两种licat+两只脑昆虫在一个狭小的空间中），您还强迫您拿着一个小组贴纸。
当前的N5三人基本上对编辑不满意。
您的队友跪下，您不必等待队友直接将地图直接推到跪下。
您正在等待队友超过200秒，并且刷更多脑昆虫和Licat的可能性很高。您害怕三个Licat。
子弹通常是空的，两个精神脑脑与Licat合作攻击和刷老板。
不仅如此，在N4的难度下，多种精神脑造成的可能性同时增加了，这比以前更加肉。

给你手柄，你来了。

PVE游戏实际上是如此酷，以至于玩家刷了一个强大的NERF播放器。

通常，将不会设计这种困难。
通用摇笔没有那么红色的石头。

---

目前，游戏内容稀缺和缺乏。

作为专注于PVE的游戏，游戏的奖励机制有点令人发指。您只能通过章节节点和完成任务目标获得经验。
但是，任务期间的怪物刷新是随机的，因此会出现。也许您可以在某个游戏中转到最终节点；三种脑昆虫出现在某个游戏中（当然，脑昆虫的刷新还没有结束，不可能结束，无法杀死它）。
以第一个炼狱为例，您只能在钷炼油厂区域捍卫发电机一次进入下一个区域。在接下来的四个警卫中，它也可能是一个四个加属机，可以修复起重机机器，最后刷刀，例如刀，例如刀具，例如刀具。章节节点和完整的章节任务目标。在第一种情况下，在第一种情况下，通过炼狱精炼厂和第二种情况，您根本没有其他奖励。

其次，当前的游戏平衡非常糟糕，大量融化的人。除战斗风格外，近战可以玩一点极低的杀戮效率。

当单身玩家玩耍时，地图的背板几乎相同。等待控制面板前的AI变速箱也很愚蠢。你不能考虑这样做吗？您是否没有一个玩家直接解锁控制面板？
同样的便秘体验是，我必须等待对话的结束才能与任务元素进行交互。作为当前内容，您需要几次点击它。任务交互点在哪里？怪物在那里刷新。

还必须特别批评当前的在线连接匹配机制。离线游戏的进度无法保留。我可以理解它是为了防止作弊。但是，目前的效果似乎非常有效。
目前，我对独特的狼玩家有非常不友好的体验。我遇到了多次匹配的任务匹配5分钟，并且没有匹配。单个人打开任务，按照最终的任务节点，卡住了，然后该任务的80％-90％。在这种情况下，您不应将我用作主持人给梅多（Medo）您来与我匹配吗？您会开发自己不玩的游戏吗？

我不得不提到其他一些经验不佳的地方，例如目前存在的和高频的动画镜片，带有杂乱的虫子。还有与PVE和PVP体验不一致的先锋爪。在无法处理PVE复杂环境中无法处理无法处理钩爪的判断中，因此只需阻止您在PVE中使用钩爪与环境相互作用吗？

最终，在2024年，这款游戏也是一个负载模拟器。以上提到的高血压转移主机，宿主叶子，无限的装载，非常好。

它不是IP风扇。不建议没有固定队友购买。
