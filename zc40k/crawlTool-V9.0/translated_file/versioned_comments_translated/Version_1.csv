Dootslayer,1,173.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050419580/,"Listen brothers! I have waited more than 10 years for this game.
And by the emperor it delivered...with some minor flaws.

When the first trailer came out it hit most Space Marine fans as a huge surprise since nobody
ever expected a sequel to finally arrive myself included, but oh boy we can be all thankful that it did because it's a blast!

I will create a mini section for the 3 main parts of the game, which are the following: The story mode, the co-op operations and PvP.

Let's start with the campaign:
What is your craft? Death.

It's a little bit on the shorter side but it's quite a ride. I try to remain spoiler free , so you can experience it for yourselves.
The gameplay is a mix of the original space marine paired with the horde system with tyranids and it works wonder for this game.
In the early game, depending on the difficulty you picked might feel slightly weak, but:
1) It's required for a healthy gameplay progression (By the middle, you'll feel a lot more potent with the gear you have, and at the end you'll be straight overpowered with a certain weapon combo), and don't forget that tyranids can rip through Astartes especially Warriors.

There is also a surprise enemy later on, which most of you'll probably expect, but it managed to be something new, a faction we never seen in a 40K game before. A breath of fresh air, a welcome change, you'll see.

I'd recommend taking it slow on the ship and taking in the ambience and mini events that happen between missions, they are 40K perfected. The devs clearly had passion and care about the source material.

And the final level: You are going to love it if you like Warhammer. It starts on a high momentum and keeps going and going until the very end. The boardroom meeting about it must have been like: ""How much hype do you want during the last 2 hours?"" ""Yes.""

So yeah, the story mode is roughly 7-8 hours long depending on the difficulty you pick, but it's a ride you'll remember.



The bread and butter of the game for the devs, the mode they clearly have priority on and want to expand further during the first 4 seasons of the game.
It's a mix of Darktide (With the fixed missions that can randomise) , WWZ with it's progression system and horde mechanics, and Space Marine with it's gameplay loop.

Overally it's really solid and has longevity if you like that kind of stuff, you can upgrade your characters and wargear with branching paths, and it's really really fun especially with friends.

There are only a few downsides as of writing this:

1) Class locks. Understandable but you can matchmake with a certain class selected and get dropped into a match in progress where you are forced to switch or quit.
2) No option to host a public lobby on your own. That's allegedly getting changed ""soon"". We'll see.
3) Balance. The balance is fine for the most part, there is only one black sheep , the assault class. It's rather weak, or simply doesn't have it's proper plance among the 6 mainline classes. It needs some slight love.



Not much to say, it gives you vibes of a game that's from 2012...but that's a good thing. You have 3 modes, the classic domination mode, team deathmatch and king of the hill. The TTK (Time to kill) is fast as it should be, and the matches are really fast and fun.

Balance seems fine for the most part, i'v played a lot of matches, unlocked some relic armors and never felt like anything needs a nerf. Of course it's early to tell, we have to wait until the community unlocks everything and some time passes, but so far it's solid.

There is only one big negativity when it comes to pvp: The maps. Don't get me wrong, they are good but there are only 3 maps currently in the game. They are adding more later on, but you can't help but feel like there should have been at least a few more on release.

A short summary for the end:
🟩 Pros 🟥 Cons

-An amazing campaign mode, which makes 40k come alive -That is slightly on the shorter side
-A really fun, classic vibe PVP mode -That has little map variety
-The graphics are really nice and works well with the art design -Technical issues on some systems, i had no problems
-The coop mode is a blast especially with friends.
-It's a long awaited sequel to Space Marine 1 and it delivers

If you read through all that, i would like to thank you for taking your time to do so and have a nice day dear reader!
Also thank you for Saber interactive for making such a banger of a sequel!",2024/9/10,en

Welcome to Follow the NetEase UU Appreciation Training Plan
Follow the UU accelerator VX public account, reply ""Steam"", and get invitations to exclusive player groups.

In front
柄 This game is very suitable for the handle operation. The vibration adaptation of the handle is very good. Walking, fighting and other feedback are very good. The keys and mouse keys are too strange, and the game experience is much worse than the handle!
P Since the game opening requires EPIC verification, if you encounter a problem, you can try to solve it according to the following methods

1. Card EPIC service update: Close the game and Steam; open the EPIC acceleration of the accelerator; search for the EPIC process in the Windows task manager and turn it off; then open the Steam to check the integrity of the game; click to start the game, re -update the EPIC ONLINE ServiceEnter the game.
2. TheEPIC service update is still unable to play the game: enter the installation directory of the game, and directly start the ""Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2"" to enter the game.

The background of the game is closely linked to the grand background of the 40K of the Hammer. As a very aggressive and large number of alien creatures, Teron Zerg has damaged many planets of the human empire.The player played by the player as the Emperor's His Emperor's interstellar warrior shouldered the heavy responsibility of defending the empire and fighting with him!
The game shows the high industrial strength in the performance of the visual effect. Various science fiction effects in the Warhammer Universe have been performed in the game. As another work developed by the developer of ""Zombie World War""The corpse tide is once again applied to this game. The dense Terren worm tide gives the players who are nervous to oppression. The vast and magnificent battlefield visual interpretation is frequently interpreted, and it is self -integrated into the player's battle, giving the player a sense of coolness!

The game retains a very traditional linear level system in the gameplay. It has no decryption or too much exploration element. The combat and remote weapons can be used in combat.Needless to say, remote shooting, but the game has added a lot of action mechanisms in melee, allowing players to play better. When the enemy emits blue light, it can be blocked.It can be understood as a slow -moving high damage skill. When the enemy's health is low, it can trigger the execution and bring a strong visual effect of killing.
However, execution is not only as simple as ending the enemy, but also a way to encourage players to fight. In the game, players' armor and life are relatively crispy. Execution can quickly reply to the armor and provide a short invincible frame.Triggering a small part of AOE damage, it is difficult to shrink the output under such settings. Going to the face and insect hard steel is the best choice and one of the main sources of refreshing.

However, it does not mean that you can have a brainless face. When facing a lot of bugs, it is the most important thing to use rolling gear and AOE damage.Will disappear quickly!

The content of the battle of this game is not long. You can clear the level in 7-8 hours, and there are no other elements under the traditional level gameplay, so it is easyIt is reflected that the game is divided into PVP and PVE, which increases the fun of the game through slight development and teamwork. Six different occupations are available in PVE mode. Different occupations have different weapons and skills restrictions. For exampleIn the melee weapon, there is only one heavy Gatling with a shield skill, which is very suitable for making strong fire output in the rear.
In addition, the experience obtained in the bureau can improve the corresponding role and weapon level, can enhance weapons and character skills, and make the battle more refreshing. In the case of not much game content, such a slight development mechanism has become a good driving force for the game!
However, there are some problems in the current online, and often there will be matching the game. However, according to the known announcement, it has been fixed. The patch should be updated in the future. At present, you can collect the task and bring AI teammates to play!

Generally speaking, this is a good action shot. Even if you are not familiar with the war hammer universe, you can still play very well. In the mode of multiplayer, it will maintain long -term operations in the future, and the potential will be unlimited!",2024/9/5,zh-cn
Poss,1,26.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014929285/,"Summary
Campaign: <15 hours of loreful hack n slash fun.
PvE: Fun with friends, but undercooked, linear and clunky
PvP: Fun with friends, but bare bones and unbalanced

I recently replayed Space Marine 1, and the sequel is a much better game. The visuals, sound and feel are all spot on for a Space Marine fantasy. However, it doesn't quite achieve everything it sets out to, and its secondary modes fall short of other similar games.

Campaign
This is very much a 40k story, with writing reminiscent of a black library novel. That is both good and bad, with the over the top sclock, bravado, action and machismo you'd expect. The grim reality of the Imperium is acknowledged, but on the whole it leans closer to glorification than critique.

The gameplay is a continuation of the first game's mechanics and feel, with chainswords and plasma guns feeling suitably impactful. It is highly linear, without meaningful choice and very little exploration. Being combat oriented and straight to the point is very Astartes, but would have grown wearisome if the campaign were any longer. The scripted executions are similarly timed to stay interesting right up to the end of the campaign, but perhaps not much longer.

There are obvious missed opportunities here. Like the vehicle levels which have placeholder cutscenes but don't let you control them, or terrain destruction which happens all around you, but you can't actually change. its also quite short, at under ten hours if you race through, or perhaps 15 if you take your time and play the optional missions as they unlock.

Still, overall it is an enjoyable romp over a couple of days

This is the bulk of the end game replayability, and the customisation will please many tabletop fans. However it has some key limitations. It doesn't have the visual depth or gunplay of Darktide, nor the endless variety and replayability of Vermintide or Left for Dead. This is a much more linear experience where you replay the same maps over and over. You do get variety from the different classes and upgrades, but progression is largely cosmetic or minor stat buffs.

Beyond the limited number of maps, skills and enemies, there are also pretty limited number of weapons, with quite a few slots having only a single option. You're likely to get dozens of hours of fun here, but maybe not hundreds. The repetition of things like execution animations which started to show in the campaign will become very clear over repeated play throughs of these levels. There is a roadmap with more content, lets hope there is enough in the pipeline to keep the juices flowing.

This is a throwback to a different kind of multiplayer, back to the days of unreal tournament or halo at a LAN party. There is a very low time to kill, and strong reliance on team coordination. There are only three maps with three game modes, so the replayability here is again limited by content availability.

PvP will be fun to play at launch, and if you have a crew together, but may struggle to drag people away from the hero shooters and mobas of the world long term.


This is a fun and brutal distraction for a few dozen hours. For some it will be a realisation of their childhood fantasy, for others it will be a gateway into an addiction they didn't know they wanted. It is a great entry into the set of warhammer games, and a worthy sequel to a fun game. It won't revolutionise the industry, but it does show that going back to basics and delivering what the fans want is a sound strategy for a good time.",2024/9/9,en

You say he can't do it. The game of the game is indeed available. It is nothing more than adding the value of the value. The repair and supplementary can be saved. Given that the game is just released, the manufacturer is also a small workshop. I can only say that the future is available.It is not enough, the explosive model must have an explosive operation attitude, and the arrows to learn fat sharks must die.
I personally like this work very much. Small flaws are uncomfortable to stop this game's excellent expressiveness on the 40K background. The pleasure of being a super macho man in a strange pile is believed to be unable to refuse. Although there is only low difficulty now, it can be possibleDo so.
Now SM2 is placed in front of the stage, and the hammer is naturally carnival, such as me.But the most important thing is the game experience.

Warhammer 40.000: Space Marine 2 (2024) represents a third-person hack-n-slash shooter game, developed by the company Saber Interactive and published by the company Focus Entertainment. The first instalment (2011) was developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ.



++ The campaign features the beginning of a Tyranid invasion, with all its horrors and endless tides of claws and teeth. Perfect setting for the grim dark future in which every melee execution results in a fountain of blood and guts. In the middle is our protagonist Demetrian Titus, who lets us see and experience the new story around him. That, dear reader, I consider the short-term motivation.

++ Now comes the long-term one, for the excellent integration of the cooperative modes allows us to play the campaign and secondary missions, called Operations, with up to two friends. Four difficulty levels in combination with six classes provide a broad spectrum of replayability. And for the brave, there is Eternal War mode, essentially a 6v6 PVP match that culminates in a battle between Space Marines and the Archenemy.

o What happened to the weight of the power armour? Each step of several hundred kilos of high-quality ceramite should leave an impact, yet the game does not convey the sounds or weight of it in a credible way. Just look at WH40K Boltgun for reference. What about the precision of ranged weaponry? Every time I fire several bolter shots the spread leaves me in disbelief. Any guardsman would severely doubt the marksmanship of that drunken angel of death standing next to him. What about crippling a Tyranid warrior? Unfortunately, not possible. A more detailed hit box with additional dismembering options would have been a great addition.

- Upon first launch of the game, an automatic installation of the Epic Online Services started. This constitues heresy of the highest order! The developers stated: „We can assure you that this was only implemented to support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores.“ Whatever the case, I immediately deinstalled it and the game runs just fine. And so should you, brother.

- A couple of bugs corrupted the holy binary code, e.g. floating items, delayed rendering of textures, clipping and collision issues. Saber Interactive’s tech priests have initiated counter protocols. The Omnissiah knows all, comprehends all.

-- I am shocked to witness the atrocities committed in front of my sacred codex. A simple Tyranid hormagaunt survives a bolter shot, and it takes a magazine to fell a warrior type. A fundamental misunderstanding of the technical background of the weapon. And I will not even start complaining about what they did to my dear melta and plasma weapons. Furthermore, there is a crippling imbalance between ranged and melee attacks, with the emphasis clearly on the latter. Just try to execute a warrior from 10 meters away, let me know how it went. The Inquisition has been informed of the devs’ transgressions; their punishment will be servitude in a penal legion against the greenskins on Armageddon.



The game nails the atmosphere of a Tyranid invasion, and the superb co-op gameplay allows for countless hours of playing the campaign with your battle brothers or prove your team’s tactical prowess in PVE and PVP sessions.

On the other hand, it displays some blatant lore inaccuracies and focuses more on close combat than on firearms, which completely undermines my attempts to crowd control the waves of biomass with ranged weapons. The Codex Astartes does not support this action!

Recommended for determined initiates and seasoned veterans, loyal to Roboute Guilliman, standing firm against the xenos filth in the darkest hours of the Imperium of Man.

Today I only judge the bad performance of the weapon design in the online PVE.

When a game weapon value fails, it is manifested.There are eight or nine optional weapons, but players have to play one of them.And that's not fun, but not to live without playing.

This game is the same as the Jedi divishes.The game where the game is the most failed in the value of the bullet gun. The player does not care whether the production team has designed a self -moving shotgun (light machine gun) and heavy automatic shotgun (heavy machine gun), but the entire bomb weapon gunThe clan was marked with 'garbage'.

In the face of high difficulty, players will have to be forced to play hot -melt weapons.Who would have thought that the strongest cornerstone on the Empire and the vehicle, there was actually no combos of the combination in the game, and the enemy's defense posture could not be moved.Elite weird chicken ribs?

When the samurai puts a double bone knife and cuts me directly with the dense heavy explosion barrage, I wondered whether I took a heavy burst of the rifle, or the Carterrell laser gun in the Star Army.EssenceYou know, Baoya is a rocket ammunition made by Jingjin. Well gold is not as hard as the bone knife of samurai?Why doesn't it even break the defense posture?

In terms of firearm shooting feel, the 1 -inch heavy bomb design looks like the feel of the .75 burst. The .75 burst feel and the strikes were not even as good as the warhammer 40000: the dark tide thief with the mortal bombs of the army had a sense of strike.All players who come to explode the shotgun will be disappointed, because in this game, the long -range weapons of you and friends when playing, only hot -melt weapons with a very low bullet capacity can help you survive. Choosing explosive guns is choosing to chooseHe died of disappointing the emperor.

Later I would like to talk to the production team to talk about the design of the game mode.

Online PVE, why don't you design an open map, like the Jedi dive 2, smash us with a jumping airdrop compartment to specify the task goal for us, let us complete ourselves?This is not faster than you design linear map updates, more playable?

What classic design of Astart's five -person jumping cockpit, will the production team not allow players to experience track airborne at once?If there is no track airborne.Every time I took the Thunder Eagle Barn, I was an airborne soldier in Astart and even the Star Army.Astart, which has not experienced the crackdown on track airborne, is equipped with Astart?There is no spirit at all!",2024/9/9,zh-cn

Not without problems, we are waiting for the patch of the first day, but I have no moral right to put a negative review.

Everything is fine in it.To the smallest details.

The space marines are felt by the space marineer.This is not an ordinary blank, but a huge genetically modified man in a heavy MK armor.10, which moves a heavy but confident
The chain sword is felt exactly as you imagine it, reading books.Huge, crumbling everything in its path, spilling rivers of blood
The bolter shoots not with ordinary cartridges, but reactive, it is felt both in the return and in the impact.
The developers were literally able to make all the mechanics as they should be.The landing on the planet of tyranids is felt literally like in the book, only more colorful, lively, and you can wash xenos in the blood with your own hands.This is truly the best that I played this year (and maybe in general)

The photo is also excellent for the word, you can beautifully click the funny cut of tyranids and heretics.I liked it

Of the disadvantages, I would note a very dubious balance in PVP, the lack of photographer in the coop, and the fact that by the fifth hour of the continuous game my 4060 lost half the frames, and the percent decided to arrange heating.But the breasts promised a patch, we wait, I do not see the reason to dial

I still can’t comprehensively express all the emotions from the game, but I can definitely say - passing on the complexity of the Death Angel is not just better than intercourse, these are the most vivid emotions in my life

Everyone and everyone recommend trying this expirence on himself, he may like it so that you want to live in this game, it can, on the contrary, will angry and get caught up with its complexity, or it can scare away blood with seas.But he will not leave anyone indifferent.

Mischief,1,145.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Travesura/,"TL;DR? Yes, I recommend this game, it's simple old school fun, some caveats here and there, regarding multiplayer, some epic shenanigans and, maybe replayability.
But if you want to have fun, it delivers.

I played the first Space Marine years ago, not when it was relaced but a few years ago, and I had fun. This game feels like coming back to that Xbox 360 era, of ""simpler"" games, you just want to burn some time, doing some bombastic and silly violence, it's perfect doing that.
You got a decent and fun to play campaign that can be played on coop with friends, (I recommend because the bots kinda suck), operations that complement the campaign, they are coop missions where you unluck experience and cosmetics, and a PVP mode.


The biggest pro's of this game, in my opinion are the gameplay, just raw fun, it can feel repetitive but, it feels so good that honestly I don't care. It can be punishing in harder difficulties but if you master the dodge and parry system you become an unstoppable killing machine.
The visuals and presentation are spectacular, from the first to the last minutes, I stopped several times to admire the work of the devs bringing to life the 40K universe, and Kudos to Saber, they did a great job. Not just representing the dark and grim aesthetic, the technical spectacle of seeing thousand of enemies on screen, the colors, particles, explosions, textures, blood. Delightful, I can say the same about the sound design and music as well.
The story is there, it's not going to blow your mind but hey, it isn't bad at all. It's a good conduct to the slaughter gameplay.

The weak points of the package, imo of course, are... maybe some optimization, lack of graphic options (ahem, FOV slider), Epic anti cheat and online services, these are kinda silly though, you can uninstall the online services if you don't want to use crossplay, and the anti cheat, well... sadly, a lot of games uses that crap, at least we don't have denuvo, thanks devs. I didn't suffer any crashes of super bad drop of performance even if my pc has some weird specs.
The gameplay can feel imprecise at some points, I'm speaking about parrying some attacks, dodging, besides of repetitive, as I said, I don't mind this, because I just enjoy how fun it is anyway.
The length of the whole package, I am happy with it but, maybe some people is expecting more content, if you see the roadmap there will be more content in the future but this isn't a life service game (thanks lord Emperor) so don't expect seasonal huge updates. Let's see how the devs manage the dlc content, I think it will be all just cosmetics but we will see...

Overall, I enjoyed this game, I had my doubts honestly, the first trailers looked too good, and after playing I can say Saber delivered a good game and a great sequel.
Thank you, after so many fiascos lately it's nice and refreshing to play a game that it's just fun, faithful to the source, made with care and dedication.

The best part of the game:

- Performance 10/10

Story Mode:

During the first mission Captain Titus is ordered to carry a bomb to be launched into the atmosphere to kill all the Tyranids on the planet, but when he fails and is about to die he is demoted to Lieutenant for alleged corruption.
After being operated on he is reassigned back to the battalion, but as a Lieutenant and during this adventure he will be with his new companions Chairon and Gadriel who will accompany him on all the missions.
At the end of the campaign there is an open ending in which Titus is sent to another place temporarily which we can see in a future sequel of the game or a future DLC.

Mabi[N]ogi。,1,35.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MABINOGI_Reborn/,"Let's talk about the conclusion first. At present, passers -by are not recommended. The battle experience is qualified, but the current content is not worth buying at full price. The online PVE and PVP experience are not good.

1. level
The battle performance is great, and the big scenes are particularly shocking. Each monster has at least three types of execution actions. Macro mobs, tearing elite's refreshing refreshing is currently the only one, but it is limited to low difficulty. Once the difficulty is increased, the difficulty is increased.In the future, the underlying movement design and the level of monsters with ""bombing against, dodge"" will give you a shit experience. The monster refresh is not logical, the number is large, and it is from all directions. There is no safe area. There is no safe area.There are very few bunkers. You can even go through the wall to shoot you from all directions. You can even wear a wall to shoot you (probably BUG). You are difficult to clean up them with low -performance long -range remote weapons and prone to bottoming ammunition.The toughness is very poor, and the power of the thunder hammer will be punching and flying, not to mention the multiple elite melee monsters mixed in the miscellaneous soldiers make you hardly finish a complete melee companyAlmost endlessly, the task goal of ""saving antenna"" in the tide is endless. If you bring two NPCs that can't do things, you are even more painful.
In addition, the battle will not give any rewards, and only a few cooperation levels will be unlocked, which makes it no heavy value for players.The latter levels of the cooperation level are very disgusting, resulting in almost only the first two levels of the online PVE, the 12 pictures that were originally made, only 2 or even 1 by players chose to play repeatedly. Players can only choose to choose for efficiency to choose for efficiency.I choose one in the boring and eat shit for freshness.

It is not so unbalanced, it is a poor performance of melee and long -range weapons as a whole. It does not match the number and strength of monsters. The positioning of firearms is close to the rifle submachine gun of ordinary shooting games.Canned samurai, chaotic Gatling rockets will also have canned dog tough dogs. In the face of them, you have almost no effective counter -counter on the offensive end.It seems that the multiple elites to death seem to be the hot melting gun, and the shotgun can not even make any hard straight to the elite.In the melee, there are higher technical level requirements, but the upper limit is lower.
The above reasons lead to the difficulty of medium high, that is, in the PVE that starts from difficulty 2, the player's choice is very limited. In addition to the hot melting gun, the high -damage and the grenades are poured to death.It is completely absent from melee.

The current development system is very simple, PVE output:
① Vocational experience → Upgrade, order professional talent
② Weapon experience → Weapon upgrades, upgrade needs → Give the talent of weapon after proficiency
③ Weapon data → Used for weapon upgrades, hard bundling with difficulty, can also be used to directly proficient in the weapon you don’t want to practice
④ Currency → Point professional talent, buy weapons, and buy coat -pairing armor accessories all need
It can be found that in addition to experience and currency, the only special props produced is weapon data, and the weapon data will soon overflow. One type of weapon is needed.bored.The output of all levels is almost the same, which also makes players only choose 1-2 easiest levels to swipe.Of course, I don't think it is a good design to swipe the entry, but it does lack diversity.
The only development of PVP is to get the battle experience to unlock the battle level, so as to unlock the types of weapons that can be configured in each profession.

The design of the PVP battle itself can only be said to be ""general"", which is a very ordinary shooting battle, and the biggest feature system of this game is invisible in PVP.
The most important problem with PVP is:
① No system!
Except for the game, there are no systems, no rankings, no competition systems, and matching all relying on fate. Only the player level and professional level accumulated according to experience will show you.
② Cheating!
The production team is almost lying flat for anti -cheating. Except for a small blue bear that does not have any effect on cheating, there are no measures!Not even the report button!I even doubt that the production team will not be processed. Even if you are infinitely thunderous, you will be disgusting in the PVP of this picture. Especially after the unlocking of No. 10, you will be seen.After the hybrids who came to China to travel across the second, everyone was honest.Who would have thought that ten of the dozen of the cheating beasts are all foreign friends who have taught Chinese.

In addition to the transition kit with a little detail in the middle, there are only 2 sets of appearance in each occupation, which are unlocked according to the field. In addition, there are very few appearances that can be unlocked.Basically reflected in color matching.

In terms of my personal configuration, there is no problem optimizing, and the game of the same level screen is difficult to find better than this game. I need to adjust the settings separately to not card.The number of frames outside the maximum pulk is stable, and the difference between the thirty or forty frames of the leakage engineering version is very obvious.
There are many small problems, including but not limited to:
Select the secondary display by default. After the settings are settled, he will give you the default selection of the secondary display, but the display in the settings 1 and 2 is replaced;
The first day of PVE cannot be loaded into the server, but the next day is repaired;
Sometimes hitting will cause the characters to be stuck in the character. After a few seconds, it must be rolled to be rolled and so on ...

Overall, the quality of this game is qualified and I like it very much, and although there are many problems, most of the problems can greatly optimize the experience. The PVE and PVP systems need to be changed.Don't want to play this PVP.The gap in the production capacity of art is very large. It requires new maps, new levels, new monsters, and a large number of new custom armor, otherwise there will be only grades to brush.Therefore, this game does not recommend the current full price purchase. If you only fight the battle, you can experience the process but only less than ten hours. If you want to play high difficulty, you need to understand and practice. If you do n’t know the right understanding, you will only spend money.suffer.",2024/9/10,zh-cn

Warhammer IP is a Warhammer Total War, which has been shown as a fantasy worldview compared to the IP name value and fandom size, and in the 40K worldview, the Dunge of War series was once successful, and it is an IP that is steadily mentioned in the game -related suffering.

As a result, the problem -related issues of the Games Workshop (typically only nuggle from the dark tide)
It was a speculation that is quite often mentioned abroad that it is involved in game development in relation to miniature sales.

Because of that reason, major game companies are reluctant to use the IP
Complex that is overflowing with steam ~ In the midst of a mass production of positive games

It was more concerned than expected when Saber Interactive, who had been evaluated for the development of the game itself with World War Z itself, was considered to be inadequate, and the fact that the post -support and operational ability was good.
The main story of World War Z had a lot of technical issues at the time of launch, and there was no longer than I thought because the content was small before the update was added.

Some of these problems are still in this Space Marine 2, but nevertheless dopamine elements that can overcome this regret are significant in the game.


1. Action production that suits the space marine

The crew has been steadily mentioned since its release that it was inspired by the Gears of War series, and it is actually a cruel and pleasant production and play method that is actually seen in the Gears of War series.This is well matched with Space Marine's character, and it is also suitable for the Warhammer 40K worldview.
In the case of the previous work, the character was so heavy except when using some jump packs, but this time I feel that I have a good feeling that it is a heavy and living weapon.

2. Visual

Unlike the previous one, Space Marine, which was too monotonous, it showed a wider range of backgrounds, providing fun to watch the background all the time, and the design of the Warhammer 40K fans, the design, art style, and the quantity of the world War ZIs excellent overall.
However, the performance is a bit unfortunate.

3. Operation expected in the long run

In the case of the previous World War Z, the main story has been pointed out a lot of problems, but this problem has been improved quite a bit with continuous follow -up, and this Space Marine 2 will be updated for PVE mode, map, and PvP in the long term in the long term.Scheduled.
If they maintain only the post -support they showed in the previous work, they will have a good impact on the long -term life of the game.

4. PVP, which is quite expected

I was able to beta in PvP, so I was smashed even if I was expecting PVP from overseas, but it was surprisingly chosen.It feels a bit different from Arena, Counter Strike, and Valorant, represented by Call of Duty, which is currently occupying the FPS game market.It feels like.The metaro so far is to die if you try to run and gun with ignorance, and it is believed that the team members gather together with 6 vs 6 confrontation depending on the position.However, it is not a feeling that the balance itself is made so much that it is not enough to go in the long run, apart from the nucleus.

5. Lack of current content and mission diversity

However, the disadvantage of the critics' evaluation and the disadvantage of the people who enjoy the absolute content itself is a little less.
The campaign itself has a variation depending on the difficulty level, but you can see the ending for 8 to 12 hours, and only six maps are the main PVE content.And the Horde mode and additional PVE content are scheduled to be updated later, so if the PVE Pai Youth layer, which has been bursting with Helgers 2, is looking for a game that can be replaced, it can be a little disappointed with the lack of content.There are few elements of PVE games and digging, but there are no elements to analyze and challenge except for the difficulty levels.

6. A technical issue that is quietly experienced

The AI ​​is a bit copper, and you can find a bug quite easily when you play, and there are many cases of delay in PvP or PVE if the server is unstable.


Overall, there is still a disadvantage of developers, lack of main contents, and technical issues
If you think about the post -support that the developer showed in the previous World War Z, it appears to be a long game.
IP accurately knows what IP is, and in this part, the overall design and design of the game is well established
Unlike the B ~ C -class Warhammer game, which was mass -produced in various genres in that it offset the shortcomings.
I feel that I was selected well.

Warhammer, a fan of Gears of War Series
Even if you are a urgent user in relation to PVE, you can buy a list price.
If you are out of the Warhammer or Gears of War series,
If you are a user who enjoys the PVE genre lightly, you can buy it as a sale price.",2024/9/10,ko

EPIC online problem

This game also adopts the form of the luxury version of the first experience. First, it means that loyalty also takes the test first, and first experience the BUG, ​​but when the EPIC online service appears at the beginning of the game, it really makes me worry aboutTo stop me, it is more about the launch.But I believe that many good brothers are still troubled by EPIC service updates, and provide two solutions to everyone.
1. Card EPIC service update: Close the game and Steam; open the EPIC acceleration of the accelerator; search for the EPIC process in the Windows task manager and turn it off all: then open Steam to check the integrity of the game; click the game, re -update the EPIC Online ServiceEnter the game.
2. EPIC service update is still unable to play the game: enter the installation directory of the game, directly start the ""Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2"" to enter the game.
The play experience in the game stand -alone is not excellent. AI teammates are miserable, and the enemy will gather fire to you. It is still difficult to be difficult for single people to play.It is best to find a friend to play together. You can try the UU accelerator connection. Not only can you help solve the problem of entering the game, but you can also escort your archive with cloud storage file service.

The main line of the main line plot battle mode is short, and the main line plot can be completed in a dozen hours under normal difficulty.In the main storyline, the player will play the deputy officer of the return to the extreme soldier queue, De Mitrian Tatuz, lead the three teams to charge, complete the unlikely task, express the loyalty to the emperor, wash his suspicion of his suspicionWin glory.The plot of the game is very good. It is very pure linear plot. It is very restored. There are no many riddles. It is very clear. Instantly, pure passers -by can get a good experience. I believe that the series fans can experience it.It is even more orgasm, and there are a large number of eggs in the original book in the game.Not to mention that this game has a Chinese character in the middle, and the effect of the middle match is also very good. With the battle of grand epic, how can it be a cool word?
In addition to the main storyline of the battle mode, this game also has the PVE action mode of six maps, as well as several PVP modes, including classic models such as team death and point.To be honest, the content of the game is not too much.

The weapons that players can use in the game include a main weapon, a pistol and a melee weapon. Of course, with the changes in the changes in the military mode and the PVP, the types of weapons can be different.The main encouragement of the attack is melee. Holding a series of weapons such as a chain sawing sword to tear the enemy to smash the enemy.And this is also the case in the battle. The ammunition of the long -range weapons in the hands of the player has received serious restrictions. For ordinary enemies, the long -range weapons can be slightly responded, but when facing a slightly stronger elite soldier, the melee looks extraordinarily particularly extra combatIt is important that melee attacks can not only cause damage in a large scale, but also cause a blow to larger enemies. It is also convenient for a series of operations such as elite enemies.The melee attack of the enemy is roughly divided into three forms. There is no prompt attack, a faster blue attack, and the non -defensive red attack. The blue attack can cause hard straight and damage by blocking.Executive.The elite monster will lose one -third of the blood volume. The blood volume of the elite monster in the game is usually expressed in three grids. The three grids can be executed, and the execution will restore the three -grid shield.The big head of the player's harm also revolves around the shield. The enemy is executed in the melee to obtain the shield to achieve the cycle in the battle. The limited long -range bullet also causes the player to get greater returns with close combat.
However, it should be said that although the game encourages melee, there will be a lot of long -range enemies if the plot is single.Firepower, the enemy will only gather you fire. If the output space is very small and if you fight positively, you need to pay attention to a large number of other mobs and elite monsters around the surrounding areas., I may have been busy for a long time.In particular, it is difficult to fight high, and it has nothing to do with Shuangyou, and the means that players can choose are more limited.

In the game, the single and multi -person parts in the game are two different development solutions. The main line plot basically does not develop a system, and some only use the plot to promote unlocked weapons and so on.The online part uses a large number of liver experience to further unlock new -level weapons to enhance the character level, so as to obtain some passive skills to form Build.The content of this part seems to be boring. After all, there are not many maps of the game. Repeating liver is indeed annoying.However, less content is more solid in the game content, the game feels solid, the firearms are well -designed, and the production of knife cut meat is bloody, and the basic content is solid at least for a period of time.",2024/9/10,zh-cn

・ Codex Astartes
Space Marine's engagement rules that are sometimes translated as ""Scriptures of Battle"".
The content is just a manual that can be referred to during engagement, such as military organization and tactics,
It's been more than 10,000 years since this was made, and it would be like a Bible.
It feels like a rule that you can't go unless you protect the space marine in this world

One of the reasons why Titas was accused of heresy in the game is
It is also a big deal to act flexibly without obeying this Astaltes.
When I suggested to escape from the falling airplane in the main story with a jump pack
There is a scene that protests, ""It's not in Astaltes!""
In other words, if you do something that is not written in Astaltes, this world may be informative hearing.

・ Astartes, Adeptus Astartes
Please note (although it is one of the factors that complicate W40K)
In fact, Astaltes has another meaning.
Sometimes when I say Astaltes, it sometimes means Adeptus Astaltes,
This means Space Marine itself.There is no choice but to interpret it by context.

Coming from someone who has little to no Warhammer 40k knowledge or experience, I had an awesome time playing through the story and operations in Space Marine 2! I just obtained all achievements after finishing the game this weekend in the early access launch period, and I’m glad to finally have this one done after grinding xp and kills for hours on hours. Space Marine 2 has pretty much three different branches of content; the Main Story Campaign, Operations (PvE), and Eternal War Mode (PvP). For me personally, the campaign was good…not bad but not great. Eternal War has potential but there isn’t a whole lot of variety with 3 maps and 3 game modes at launch….I know in the roadmap there is more planned which is great! The Operations were the highlight of my time with the game. Character customization and class progression feels killer, and I really liked the different difficulties. Visually the game looks amazing, performance wise I did have a few crashes/freezes and some connection issues when connecting to others. Crossplay worked decent during the campaign and operations, but I really wish there was a way to turn on/off cross-play in PvP since I’d love to team up with my brother who plays on his PS5. Overall, the hunt for the grindy achievements like maxing out a class or killing 41k enemies was what fueled my desire to complete this game and it feels great to add this one to the list!

In the plot, you are straightforward and the elder brother is a superman. You cut, you shoot, you presented the throne;

In the task, there is no essential difference between you and the big soldiers in the plot. The logic of the monster refresh is almost terrible. I have encountered sporadic encounter from beginning to end.There are 20 sniper insects, and you can hold you on both ends. You can't take care of yourself when you hit your life.
The difficulty curve is very fascinating, and the basics of most collected versions are stuck in the second -order weapon.The third-level precision worker must be difficult to fight 3, the small caterpillar burst shotgun requires 4-5 guns, and you only have 180 rounds, and you can't find the supply, because this is also part of the difficulty.

In the past three days, many Chinese and foreign hammer powder teams have passed the team. Many of the sacred armor, holding the knife and rotten guns, everyone smiled at each other.
You have no advanced weapons, you can't beat it; you can't fight, so you can't get advanced weapons.closed loop.

It is also a waste firewood.You can only be hot -melt -fused face and bet on life.If you have to play melee, you can take you by the BUG brother with sniper soldiers, and the unlimited bullets sneak infinitely.But bringing out your highest -level equipment, you still can't beat anything.Awkward.

I have hammered for 24 years, combined with my major, embarked on this way of love. This game has evolved a lot compared to the previous generation, but it is still worthy of my scolding.
Many things are not sincere, and many things beyond the technical level forcibly join.I hope it will be repaired in the future.

g_divergence,1,11.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gdiverge/,"What can I say... (Edit: A lot apparently)

From the campaign alone I think it was a solid buy.

The combat isn't mind-blowing DMC5/MGSR melee combat action awesomeness, and the shooting isn't quite as tight as more focused cover style shooters, but - and this is a big BUT - you feel like a space marine. How is that not cool?! You're a little slow, a little heavy, but you feel like a 10 foot tall dump truck ready to steamroll anything that isn't painted blue. The weapons don't have a massive amount of variety, but on some reflection, I think its acceptable. Would I have liked to see some of the more insane bits of kit for use? Sure, but that isn't really the ""I am a tactical marine that branches out a bit sometimes"" vibe that Titus gives off. (I would still kill for a terminator armor mission, to be clear.)

As far as the breadth of content goes, it took me just over 9 hours to beat the campaign on veteran, and I plan on going for max difficulty here in the near future. Was it a riveting story? No, not really. But it was good. It feels *authentic* in a way that was refreshing, like I could open just about any 40k book and find something like this in its pages. The story I think actually does itself a disservice in some ways where certain elements are underplayed or resolved a bit too quickly, but still, it had all of the beats it needed to, and a more than appropriate amount of justice to the setting to sell me on this being the actual 40k universe.

Some will see the 9 hour campaign and see that as a deal breaker. If you play on game-journalist difficulty and don't do anything but sprint from checkpoint to checkpoint, I wouldn't be surprised if you could get it as low as 7 hours. For some, 10 bucks an hour is a bad ROI, and if you don't have *any* interest in playing the PvE or PvP, then maybe that's all you'll get out of the game. But hear me out. We are often spoiled with sprawling massive games that suck you in for 100+ hours, and this isn't that. Instead, you get a meticulously, fairly challenging, hand crafted experience with what is perhaps one of the greatest fictional universes ever. That has to be worth *something* even if it means ""I'll definitely get it on sale""

To sum up:

If you are a fan of 40k or just like 3rd person action games, its an easy buy.

The only reason I would say to steer clear for now is if you expect nothing less than Elden Ring: Space Marine edition in the content department for your hard earned bucks (which, fair enough if that's you).

I look forward to grinding through the PvE content over the next week or so, and will probably even dabble in the PvP to check it out as the game gets updated over the next year, and perhaps even beyond!

Well, having completed the story mode, cooperative mode and thrown PVP I can say that the game is cream, it is the top that has to reach a game of Warhammer 40k, without despising others that do very good work worse even is jewelExempt from failures.Let's start:


GRAPHICS AND OPTIMIZATION: 10/10
If I like something of Focus, it is that the studies they have work very well in the games, that is, this game with a 2080 move it in ultra and do not fall at any time of 60 fps, everything they taught is, nothing of nothingDowngrades.

Difficulty: 3/10
I do not know what they have done to the game in this aspect apart from being designed to play with friends, it is that when playing in coop and history mode they have gone a lot with enemies that can make you instant kill, which is worth having to have toBeing challenging but it is a game that you are surrounded by enemies, there is no way to do it tactically, but if you play it in normal mode, they also give you tremendous unde.lower and that is recommended and has nothing to do with the level of your character.

History mode: 7/10
Well, the story without spoilers is a very good successor of the one giving depth to the characters and the world itself but with perhaps lore errors that are very caught with tweezers, but within what fits, very good

COOP mode 8/10
It is the other part of the story mode campaign and like the story mode you can play it alone or with friends, it has nothing beyond

Personalization: 9/10
Here it seems that they have heard the community because the improvement is brutal, being able to independently each part of the Astartes, and with a detail that the colors are the colors of GW, on the other hand, the bad, that everything is blocked everything and thatPart are DLCS, besides that the worst thing is that heretics do not let you just customize it, something that seems amazing, I hope that in the future they change it.

Multi mode: 8/10

This has nothing beyond what was in 1, same ways, in the future there will be survival mode (exterminatus) and there is nothing more remarkable than the levels you raise here and what unlocks is not set with the coop mode, and it is upset because there is much, too much to unlock and does not give so much the game

Final note 8/10
A worthy successor of Space Marine 1 with what one expects from the sequel, improvements, more bleeding and death, and with brutal moments, very well achieved",2024/9/8,es

In general, there are not many good games, but Space Marine 2 is not just an example of a good game in the universe, this is an example of a game where people who standing are real fanatics who rummage for memes, for the ENT.They rummage about how to make sure that you can not tear yourself away from the screen to the titers.They shouted from Epic, imbued with characters, and at the end they simply looked at the titers under a damn steep soundtrack in ecstasy, and let the mean ultramarine tear that the adventure of Titus ended (or not?)).

Distemper,1,371.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198320092262/,"The main plot is very good, but the remaining multiplayer content (online PVE, PVP) is not very high, and the overall content is small (the battle is only 10 hours).In addition, combat needs to practice, which is not easy.

As a 40K enthusiast, it is not recommended by hammer powder.
=======================================================
1. The biggest advantage: the plot battle experience is quite good.
The details of the fighting and logistics scenes are particularly sufficient, and the sense of presence of the 40K war is very good.
The NPC dialogue is rich and delicate, and the character image is clear, like a TV series with an immersive experience.

2. Main disadvantages: Compared with pricing, the content of content is still less, only 10 hours.
The main line battle content is only 10 hours.After the completion, there are many online PVEs (branch plot, while talking about the main line plot, what other teams are doing). At present, there are only 6 tasks.Then there are PVP, which can be ignored by poor balance.

For more than ten hours of content for this price game, the volume is too small.(As a comparison, the recently priced black myth Goku is enough for 60 hours)


The combat mechanism determines that this game is not a relaxed and happy tour, but that it needs to keep the fast-paced block/dodge-pistol headshot counterattack-execution cycle.

Most of the melee weapons are not fast, and it is not easy to cancel after the movement.Therefore, it is often easy to be beaten by active attacks at high difficulty, and only a small amount of movement is practical.Remote weapons are mediocre other than hot melt (sniper are only suitable for a small number of elite monsters, and ammunition is very limited).The blocking-execution can quickly restore armor and clear the miscellaneous soldiers, and the income is very high.

Nice Campaign Experience, But Size of Content Doesm Match the Price (~ 10H Campaign + 6 PVE MAPS + PVP).

Welcome to Follow the NetEase UU Appreciation Training Plan
Pay attention to the NetEase UU connoisseur and start a wonderful game journey.

Honor is my life!
The game style of the game is as 40K as ever, and the scenes everywhere are full of dark retro Gothic style. Among them, there are some classical and magical high -tech.To the huge worldview, the collision of realism and futurism is the ultimate harmonious fusion. Maybe this is one of the keys to the war hammer 40K that has been standing and derived!The entire game process can always give us a bunch of new visual shocks. Under the premise of the visual effect setting to the highest premise, it is not an exaggeration to say that step by step is!

The game has Chinese dubbing throughout the game. Even the supporting role and passersby on the roadside, A, Bing Ding, will jump out from time to time to make the game feel immersive!Especially during the fighting process, the soldiers faced the almost unsatisfactory wave tide used in all directions. Everyone still shouted ""For the Emperor!""The fearing atmosphere of the battlefield is absolutely absolutely!

The game started at the planet under the control of the Empire in the alien Alien Toron Zerg, and the Star Fighter killing the team to lead the team.Sri Lanka did not die, so the mission of saving the planet can naturally only be undertaken by us!The only one who can accompany us is the opening of a chain sawing sword and the explosive guns picked up on the road!In this novice tutorial that allows the novice to die N times, after some struggle, in the end, after successfully launching a poisonous gas bomb to the flat flow layer, the unsatisfactory alien and its BOSS were surrounded.At the time of life, the rescue finally arrived!When we woke up again, the protagonist we manipulated had been transformed into a great and powerful original Star Warrior!The more dangerous legendary battle opened the curtain!Everything is ""For the Emperor!""

As the most powerful original Star Warrior of the Empire, the empire equipped us with ten explosive guns with different performance power in the weapon library, three empire -style pistols that can be used with melee weapons, and four powerful power.Melee weapons to ensure that we can win every time we go out!Different styles have their own attack mechanisms and attack effects. We need to choose the equipment for ourselves before the war!

The battle process of the game is simply bloody. In the face of the tide of uncomfortable alien worm, countless groups of turbulent rushing comes, whether it is using the burst of vermiculite guns in the hand for various long -range fire spray covers, andOr hold the chain saw the sword and shout ""For the Emperor!"", And then rush into the wave of insects to harvest a wave of blood!With the teammates fighting around, it feels that it will really make people forget the fear!Maybe this is the power of faith and comrades in the legend?

Of course, excitement and excitement, if you can't keep up with this strength, multiple tasks failure will be frustrated!Although we have become the most elite original Star Warrior of the Empire, and holding the most powerful weapons of the Empire, there are also legends: ""As long as it is carbon -based creatureThe wave tide is really too much too dense!In the process of passion Peng Bai's battle, a grenade will throw in a bunch of scenes in the market, and there will be a set of battle to fly a bunch of battles, but the friends who have a deeper memory is that the little friends are more profound.Come over the scene where the tide of the insects comes out of the body of our body!IntersectionBut this does not affect the set of refreshing and stimulus that we can enjoy a group of refreshing and stimulus in the constant fighting process. Do not feel too cool!

But when there is always a cooling of passion, the single plot mode of ""Warmmer 40,000: Space Marine 2"" is too short. Basically, it can be cleared in ten hours, and the game is a linear plot. There is no setting of the branch lines.Even if there are so many small corners that have not been explored, there are no surprises and treasures in it. A few vocal chips are already the biggest harvest.Therefore, after clearing the plot, there is no need for many weeks.

Fortunately, ""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2"" still supports online multiplayer models. After selecting a profession in this mode, there will be some weapons restrictions.The realization is the greatest fun!The proficiency of the firearm that is improved through combat also gives the game with so some development elements, and the improvement of the corresponding firearm proficiency has become the biggest pursuit of better fighting with friends to fight better!Of course, online online mainly pays attention to the stability of the network, especially the captain. Once a drop is dropped, it will drag all the players to exit the game together!I have to recommend the UU accelerator here!Use the UU accelerator to accelerate the network to make the game, which is enough to make your entire game process steady as an old dog!——The friends no longer have to worry about the Internet drop!

In addition, at the beginning of the game, it seems that EPIC verification is needed (I haven't encountered it, but many friends have encountered it). Here is a solution to the friends who encounter EPIC verification:
1. Card EPIC service update: Close the game and Steam; open the EPIC acceleration of the accelerator; search for the EPIC process in the Windows task manager and turn it off; then open the Steam to check the integrity of the game; click to start the game, re -update the EPIC ONLINE ServiceEnter the game.
2. TheEPIC service update is still unable to play the game: enter the installation directory of the game, and directly start the ""Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2"" to enter the game.

Finally, the designer of the keyboard key position of the game operation must be a ""genius"", and it designs the block to the C key!What the hell is this ghost animal design!IntersectionIntersectionIt is still recommended to use the handle here, which is better adaptable for game operations!It can also make the battle more comfortable!

In the end, we need to praise the emperor!He gave us such a refreshing gaming experience!Let us fight together for the emperor!Fight for loyalty!",2024/9/10,zh-cn

G?$T|HUN|,1,14.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghosthun1999/,"It was rightly a big hype for the arrival of Space Marine 2, which may be disappointing for some.

Typically, we are talking about a single category for a one -time passage, which is well done otherwise, but nothing extra.In short, Story has established a crusade campaign to regain lost worlds from their enemies.

Essentially, we go ahead and grind our opponents on a closed course.In fact, wood wedges are simple mechanics and can be played in 6-8 hours.Which is a red point that you can take the whole campaign in a 3 -person COOP game mode.And with the progress of the story, there are so -called Operation missions, which take place next to the main Story at the same time, of which there are a total of 6 missions.You can develop, there is a Skill sector, but its multi -sector is not attracted.

Graphics are fine, environmental elements, details, the whole world has been spectacular.And all I could write about sounds is average.We will see optimization that it did well.Ultra settings 1440p, RTX 3080, i7 9700k on average 70-80 fps.

As a negative, CPU is a strong game.Today's more demanding games with max graphics are around CPU max 50-55c, but here the 60-67C reaches smoothly.It is a pity to miss HDR and the installation of EPIC compulsion is tragic.The price is dependent on who is worth a 6-8 hour relatively linear campaign.

[★] NapoSky_* ☺,1,110.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/napoleon59w/,"This game is an all -azimuth banger.
In advance: forget the opinions of the streamers, forget the opinions of the casus which expect to have everything within hand without doing anything.It's neither the game for nor the universe for.
If you made the first Warhammer: Space Marine, one watchword: go for it.For the emperor.

Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 is definitely the worthy successor of the previous opus.
- Did you find graphic gaps in the first?Swept away.
- Did you feel like you are always alone in a huge universe?Forget.
- Did you go around the first by saying that it was rather arcade with a little slammed difficulty?Also forget here, we try.There are really many tyrannids, and chaos agents hit heavy
- Are you a fan of Astartes fanmades videos?Here we still go up a notch.

A bit like Doom Eternal, you could stop in front of various fighting plans in the distance so much the decor is dynamic.At first glance you can say to yourself ""haha, out of a thousand tyrannids I will only have 10"".No, no deceptions, you will really eat hordes in time.

Conversely, casus which say that the campaign is terminated in 6 hours (by playing in easy and rusing, of course).Allow 10 hours to try to complete it in a veteran, and a little more than 8 pm in the angel of death (ie ""no less than the first opus"").The difficulty is there, and cooperation is in order.You are in perpetual movement in an invasion of a hive vessel which is there to eradicate you.

The operations complete the scenario since they are skimping missions annexed to Titus missions, allowing you to discover new objectives, and for your greatest pleasure: new bosses.

Do you remember the Lore of 1?Be ready for the scenario deployed by the 2.


All that to say:
+ Definitely a banger for an AA studio
+ The Lore, the script, the cutscenes, the graphics are monstrous
/ We could cut on linearity, but very clearly given the quality deployed with 13 years of waiting, it is really a detail.
- The combos and techniques learning curve is not linear.We will have to spit blood at the start to rise in difficulties.

As a multiplayer, it is good but it needs to polish much how much respawns areas, closed areas, general life and balance classes more, I think there could be a fairly decent multiplayer if they retouch these aspects.

9.5 out of 10 (excellent)
Plot
It unfolds in the 42nd millennium, in the era of the Dark Empire.After the Primarch Robaut Gilliman returned, humanity begins a new campaign to return the lost systems, known as the “irresistible crusade”.At this time, at the western borders of the Galaxy, a new fleet of tyranids is found, nicknamed Leviathan.Humanity is preparing to repulse the invasion of the invasion of the fourth tyrannical war.
The Order of the Ultramarinov, the protagonist of the first part of the game, is sent to the Avaraks and Kadaku systems to repel the attack of tyranids.In the ranks of the order, a detachment of Lieutenant Titus, consisting of a sergeant, Gardriel and brother of Haron, fights.
It is a mixture of action genres and a third -person shooter.The player has to take on the role of the cosmic paratrooper of the Order of the Ultramarins, fighting against tyranids - a hostile race, striving to destroy humanity.
Various types of weapons are available in the game, such as a chain sword, a fighting knife, a hand-brewer manual pistol and heavy bolters.You can also use Melta-Miller, melting everything in its path with a plasma stream.
The combat system is based on the use of various techniques and abilities of the cosmic paratrooper, such as blocking strikes, parrying and dodging.The player must skillfully combine these elements in order to effectively fight enemies.
The gameplay includes the implementation of various missions and battles with various types of tyranides, such as ordinary chormagounts and large tyranes-warriors.The player will move along a variety of locations such as spaceships, planets and orbital stations.
Graphics in the game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 impresses with its level of detail and elaboration of the environment.The game offers incredibly detailed textures and models of characters, creating a feeling of immersion in the gloomy atmosphere of the Warhammer 40,000 universe.Hordes of enemies and the environment leave many players in reverence before the scale and quality of graphics.
1) The plot: the continuation of the story of the protagonist, the famous cosmessor Titus from the first part of the 2011 Space Marine.
2) The game modes: PVE and PVP mode are available, called “operations” and “eternal war”, respectively.
3) Campaign: In addition to the story campaign, players can perform missions in cooperative mode for three people.
4) The character pumping: players can improve their hero, increasing his characteristics, skills and discovering new abilities.
5) customization: players can configure the appearance of their hero, choosing from many available options for armor, helmets and other elements of equipment.
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is an excellent shooter that will delight fans of the Warhammer universe and fans of tense battles.The game offers an exciting gameplay, impressive battles and an atmosphere of grandeur.Graphics and performance are at a high level, and the multiplayer mode adds a variety.Fans of the series and beginners will like the game.
P.S.1 - the game has a great potential to expand content using csyement DLC.We hope that the developer realizes these opportunities.
P.S.2 - During the game, the only technical failure was the frozen outfit of the opening video at the beginning of the new game, however, after installing the last NVIDIA driver, the problem was solved, otherwise I did not observe any technical problems about other reviewers.
P.S.3 - very pleased with the presence of complete Russian voice acting.",2024/9/8,ru

For some this may not reach the expectations that they had been hoping for after such a long wait, for me i was satisfied with story and length. The COOP experience allowed for a lot more of a immersive time.

This is a genre of game that can always live on and with time if supported with their already shown roadmap, this will easily live up to being one of the best WH40K games next to the Dawn of War series.

For twenty and a little hours, the impressions of the game are extremely positive.Everything looks expensive-god, I have something to admire.The style of the universe is recreated perfectly, it is pleasant to consider architecture and other environment on locations between meat grinders with opponents.The background of open levels is almost always dynamic, which adds the scale of what is happening, the liveliness of the world and the sensations of planetary hostilities.The combat system is rather not bad, combining distant and close battle.There is a dion, rebound, block and parrying.You can do meat colorful finishing, the animations of which are more than 50 pieces.They depend on your weapons, the enemy and his position in relation to you.Opponents sometimes have a piercing with whole teeming hordes, like rats in the games of a Plague Tale, which looks epic.
Together, you can take both the main plot of the game and individual combat operations, which are currently 6 pieces.They are woven into the main plot, showing some events developing in parallel.The choice of four difficulties and six classes of fighters with different abilities, weapons and survivability.Cooperative is cross -platform and works fine.
The multiplayer resembles GEARS of WAR, except that you can’t sit down for a shelter.So far, there are only a few cards and three modes, two of which are “Desmach” and “capture and retention”.Team 6na6 with the same 6th classes of fighters.The team can have no more than two fighters of the same class.The multiplayer works fine, although there are times when it throws off when connecting from the server, and the entire lobby and the search begins again, I hope they will fix it.Despite the fact that many complain about the technical condition of the game, my game itself flew out in 20 hours only once and, strangely just at the first launch, so it is not considered.
I think the developers can be proud of their creation, and the game will become a worthy part of the Universe, where the war goes forever.They even have any plans to support the game in the future, which is curious.Personally, I demand the addition of the seventh grade ""Apothecaria"" with the possibility of outfitting allies and cut out progenoids from the fallen comrades.",2024/9/6,ru

By the time you try to be drunk with Warhammer Pong.After the first, the second round is like a drinking ceremony to take care of each multi.
I think I wake up and think about going home or secondary.

Why do you recommend it?
No T -type Geno?Is it a gin stealer?Is it a hostage?
Inquitter Call number 111


The most important thing
'Can you do this game Warhammer?'
Unfortunately, people who don't know Warhammer will feel like watching the Infinity War for the first time in the Marvel movie.

Why are you suspicious of the protagonist?What is Deathwatch?Chaplin is a good one?
What is the knife?What are the children like juggling?

In other words, people you know are injected with Warhammerpong.
To the early Tyranid situation, the latter part of the situation, and the Ultramarin's assembly, which was ignored by Smurfra
Dreadnot's performance scenes, which were ignored by various media ...
It is like the next generation of karaoke that is almost infinite for people.


Except for that, it is a repetition of enemy hordes and movements while protecting it.
As the battle itself passes, it becomes boring.Impact disappears.The anticipated Horder was cool
If you don't have an uncomfortable targeting, try it hard.
The counterattack is a fraudulent, but it doesn't work well for the jobs.Rather, boss war is easy.1 to 1


In addition, music.
There is no memorable music to break the game.
Dark tide next to the neighborhood is a marine jjajang nuggle game
If you only hear the OST, the tears are the opposite of the emperor's thoughts.
This game is like a hymn from the church on Sunday, which is obliged to see the Majesty of the Emperor.


And as a whole, the game is a bit lighter
Tytus jumps like a girl walking out.
You can give you more vibration on the pad, but you can resonate the axis when you run.
The idea of ​​the game is from the start to the end of the game.


There was a lot of acclaim for hitting, but I'm a little disappointing
As the times changed, I expected a much better feeling compared to the previous or franchise similar works.
The firearms sounds like a siege tank, and the bolt's power is less than the hitting feeling.
Even in the case of Melta Gun, the effect is too big on the screen, so what is the kids beyond the effect?

It's not bad, but it's not cool.
It's a pity that the Homagunt is the Astartes game.
I can't Oba like a martial arts, but I feel about 80% of the feeling of changing it more cool.
Personally, the most anticipated cheaphammer is the most unfortunate.
It tastes like wielding, but the taste of the hand was a little lower.
The latte is the same, but I was looking forward to the mulberry taste of Space Marine 1, but it was a little different.


It's a multi -entered game, so I can't help it.


Multi is not yet deeply embarrassed by PVP, but I won't evaluate it,
First of all, I see a lot of Chinese .....
The proximity of the proximity is a net, but of course the patch will be
The Warrowhammer fans know that the balan network is a long tradition of Warhammer Franchise.

PVE was interesting because it was the story of a team that was ordered by Taitos in the campaign and went to another mission.
It's a team of Balius, who went to catch a hive tirent when the Taitus team bypassed it.
It was nice to have an improved AI with the improved AI.
The downside is that the battlefield has been wide, so each individual has a busy situation rather than cooperation.
This is the problem of the workshop.

as a result
It's a delicious game to eat and eat this game, it's hard to know.
Marvel cinematic study is a kids' joke
Nevertheless, the fun of cutting the Horde from the battlefield drawn with the next generation engine is good in the short term.
Except for that.It will be divided according to individual differences, such as how much you enjoy this kind of multi.
It is the same as the coop series where the single cools.",2024/9/9,ko

If the incisions do not merge the game.If they do not add any libero-Petushinsky outfit, if they continue to support online, then this is one of the best Igor of the year.Along with Bibizian.Well, at least there may be one of the coops of the year.Heldyvers is already merged into the toilet.A good example is not to work.We will need to go to the Seiberians that they see what's what, and will not do strange and dibilated actions.

It is better to piss the corpses of enemies for the sake of the emperor ... And in general, yes, it really is better.

PS.A small addition.At the exit, the game hangs.In this, I close it through the antiquity of Duspeck.A trifle, but you still need to get the whole thing.",2024/9/10,ru
FroheMilchmann,1,13.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037650969/,"UPD: So, I finished the campaign after almost 9h. Honestly, I feel like raising my score to a solid 9/10, it somehow kept getting better and more epic every hour. I haven't even touched the operations and PVP yet, but I'm ready for more gameplay, it was awesome. Could you find some nitpicks? Sure, I heard some people saying that it's too coop oriented, finishers don't give you health the same way as in the first game, etc, but I personally loved it. One of the best 40K games out there at this point.

EARLY REVIEW

I’ve gotta say - before I played it myself, I had a healthy dose of doubts and was just cautiously optimistic about this game, but man - it’s a blast so far! Considering the amount of epicness happening at all times, it is surprisingly well optimized and runs at very stable 60 with all high settings. The main thing that might bottleneck for some people is CPU, so you might wanna check that (thankfully I have no problems with it).

Gameplay-wise, it’s quite fun, more engaging and deeper than the first game, but it is more coop/online oriented (however, I have no issues playing it solo currently).

Story-wise - pretty much what you might expect from an action game based in the 40k. Nothing groundbreaking, but the tone is great, and characters are enjoyable.

Graphics, art, sound design - really impressed, you can feel the scale of big war, but at the same time there are little details everywhere that fans will surely appreciate. Guns and music are more meaty this time around, which I love.

Long story short - if you like solid, gripping action, and of course, the 40k universe, then it’s a must! GO SLAY SOME TYRANIDS FOR THE EMPEROR, BROTHER

merit
Fan gods like me are also well implemented in the walls that are crazy and dying.It's just a god.
Warhammer worldview setting atmosphere.
As the campaign in the middle of the NPC conversations or the surrounding environment, the more immersive, the more immersive and I feel as if I am a real smile.
Many enemy groups are crazy.When the enemies approach, 'Come.'This word is thrilled enough to explode with fostering.
The sound of combat execution action Jirim headset is raised loudly.
The short campaign will be bored with the crazy story that makes the lifespan change and the man who is a man.If the chick plays this game, it is a testosterone that will grow into an emperor's symbolic pair.
Chun -nam, a dog like a slanesh.
There's a lot to do after the campaign.But it's not a severe noga.If you go to a high risk mission under the assumption of a true Adaptus Artartes, you will soon take a job level.
It's like the best of the recent games.

It can be seen as a cold beer that drinks dirty on a dirty day.

General evaluation
The best game among the 40K Warhammer.There were a lot of games like Unclean One's bowel movements, but for some reason, a huge masterpiece was born.

----- Finally, the emperor woke up in the golden throne and did a miracle .------
It would be enough to say a word.

The people who hit the fanzine of the Zenchi also say that the story is short, the hitting feeling is copper.
I don't know if there's a better game than this.

You don't have to listen.They are dissatisfied with the fact that they know that there is no perfection and find perfect in the game.
Listen and report yourself and judge.

The emperor, who had a strange key setting, was whining and the compromise was not talented, and even humans, who had difficulty and did not have fun, allowed a refund.
I hope you can play with the refund system.

Brothers, listen to my words, because I have just gone through an experience that could almost equal the glory of the real battlefield.I played an entertainment of the Imperium, named ** Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 **, and I must say that it is worthy of the greatest heroes of the Adeptus Astartes.

From the moment I took control of the marine space in this simulacrum, I felt a familiar power, that of our energetic armor, faithful and heavy, each resonant step with overwhelming intensity.The developers of this game have accurately captured the honor and terror that accompany the wearing of a Mark VII armor.The fight ... Ah, the fight, brothers!Each shunner sword stroke vibrates with a brutal truth, each bolter shot strikes with the strength of the emperor himself.They understood what it means to conduct a holy war against xenos and heretics.

The enemies I faced, these detestable tyrants, were numerous and ferocious.Their endless carnage reminded me of the wars on Macragge.The game perfectly captures the frenzy of their assaults, forcing you to hold your line, to use each bolt and each stroke with precision.You feel the urgency, the sacred obligation to protect the imperium at all costs.At no time did I feel vulnerable, because as in reality, I knew that duty transcends us.But the tension, brothers ... The tension was palpable, each battle a test of faith and steel.

The visual of this game is a real ode to the Imperium.Impressive citadels, bordered by statues of angels and sacred relics, to the vast battlefields where blood and mud mix ... everything breathes the 41st millennium.Each detail seems blessed by the technoprêtres of Mars, a loyalty such that one would think it would walk on the emperor's own worlds.

And music!Brothers, she resonates like the Songs of Chaplains before the battle.She takes you beyond the limits of the flesh, pushing you to fight even more ardently for humanity.Each note seems to be reinforced by faith in our Holy Emperor-Dieu.

I tell you without hesitation: this game is a blessing, an honorable way for those who cannot yet join our ranks to understand what it means to be an astartes.Whether you are aspiring, Imperium's servants, or even simple citizens, ** Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 ** will give you an overview of our existence, of our sacred duty.

Brothers, if you have time to devote outside the real fight, then play this game. Because it will remind you of the glory of our mission, the weight of our armor, and the greatness of serving the Emperor.

tragic,1,565,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cureton/,"At the time of my review, I've done everything there is to do in PVE. I've gotten every class to 25, unlocked every perk, leveled every weapon to relic tier, unlocked every mastery point for each weapon, unlocked every heraldry, unlocked every cosmetic (through operations - 35 successful missions per class), and beat every operation on ruthless. Also beat the campaign, which I enjoyed.

The moment to moment gameplay is fun and rewarding as there is a skill element to maximizing your offense. Parry and Perfect dodge are great additions. All of the combat mechanics combined make grinding for unlocks in operations more of a fun journey than a chore, at least for me.

For those wondering about campaign length. It's approximately 7 hours give or take, and if you are on harder difficulties, you may find that to be longer. When you combine that with the Operations that tie into the story, that buffs it up to the 10-12 hour range.

Doing all the operations on ruthless difficulty (current max) and soloing them all was a really fun challenge, but it's not required.

EDIT: I've now played a ton of PVP (still ranking up) and I'm having a blast. At max Veterancy Level (25), I've played 100s of matches. The PVP is quite good, but it suffers from map variety. The balance is actually quite good, and there are plenty of strategies and counter strategies appearing as players get more experienced.

Overall, great game, I didn't run into any major issues, all of the classes are fun (and will be funner when a few small bugs are fixed). Emailed the devs and they mentioned a few of the bugs that I had submitted have already been addressed. I'll report back with my findings.

RE: Hours played: I was in both the preview and review periods of the game (which was about a month or so) which is why I have a considerable amount of hours. Not ALL of the hours were 100% playtime of course... things like setting up scenarios for videos, capturing footage, editing... but I would say I probably have at least 300+ hours of playtime in the game.

Review on September 8th

If you see a friend who commented on my comment, if you are not brain disabled or want or like Thai -Japanese or Smurfs if you are not brain -residual powder or you really want or really want to or like the sacrifice group.


After exiting the game, the more you think about it, the more and more uncomfortable. You say that I am a pure hammer Xiaobai. Even if I don't care so much, I don’t care about it.But at least I have liked this subject from the War Dawn 1, so I will care about some settings that have been moving to the game in the game.

The interstellar warrior here is a new one, right? The original Star Warrior should be higher, stronger, stronger, and faster than the first generation of this game. In addition to the picture, what do you think have changed?Well, I think in this game, the performance has become weakened. After the casting of Thai and Japan, the ""Blessing of Blood God"" will not be executed and the blood will become poor.Three times that of Beef is really three times and the energy of the armor 1 generation may be 5 times the speed of this.It's not the samurai that is not the samurai, but you only need 2. So how much do you see the knife and insects in the game? Sorry, I did n’t count anyway anyway.Of course, your operation is not blocked directly to the street

Okay, then our new Star Warrior power, what do you say? Should I take that difficulty 4 level? Okay anyway, you don’t have the bad cans of Magnus's cubs.Quickly solve a bad canned food, which is likely to be resolved by him that people can kill you in seconds and you may not be able to take him in seconds.

Then let's take a look at the military weapons prepared by Dorakle for everyone?Um, in the case of almost difficulty in various explosives and weapons 4, in addition to those specialized headshots, the remaining remaining are all abandoned and miscellaneous goals.It may not be done after two elites that may not be done, even one may not be done because the other party is also moving you, but the spiritual flames that may be blasted on the opposite side can make you a pink powder. Is this a new weapon? Is this a new weapon?Why is the difference between the differences in the official books I read? I think it ’s not as good as that of the first generation. These guns even do I even think that the production team has never seen the weapon setting of the warhammer?When I used a hot -melt gun, I concluded that the production team only looked at the picture. The hot -melt cleaning of the miscellaneous soldiers listened to such a thing.Well, but ah, but have you seen a samurai, can you eat 5 rounds of hot face?Um can eat 7 ~ 9 rounds ... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Then ah the hot -melt bomb. This stuff is very powerful and you can only bring one of these after picking up. This is not a problem. This thing. You can only put it down in place.It is impossible for you to even throw a hot -melt bomb. This hot melt is heavier than the biological crustal on the back of the dumplings ~~ Anyway, the biological crust on the back is shot to the one hand. I can't understand it.These new interstellar warriors

Then the so -called original casting equipment is modularized. Um in this game, you have become a career.Equipped to armed into a specific type of interstellar warrior instead of a professional production team should go to see the official settings and then become a profession, which causes many weapons to become fixed.Use bandit and then heavy rifle. Only the so -called tactical Star Warriors can use it. Haha ... I want to sayIn the pioneer, what weapon he took in his hand?Do you dare to tell me the production team?Don't know?That is obviously a heavy -duty explosion rifle installed with fireproofer ~~~ Know, everyone said that the production team did not play the pioneer in the original star -like modular performance game.GM's melee weapon has also been fixedly fixed with our tactical Star Warrior to bring a full set. Sorry, I don’t like the Shield Guard.

I don’t want to say a few chicken ribs, and some of them are some of the chicken ribs.

Then there is a sacred thing in the game. You can pick up and take it after you fall to the ground. You can get up such a funny thing after falling to the ground. We use the original Star Fighter.Bellyza
In a good actual game, we have no functions of this stove. I want to fan you, you read, okay?
It's okay to see the rules ~~~ I don’t know what is the Bellysa Storo.

Then continue to vomit, it is not as good as the first generation and the first generation. You can make the enemy under the loss of the enemy through the melee weapon.The enemy who was originally there was still the enemy that was refreshed later.Flash red can execute the brushed strange tide mobs, you can only set off a shooting execution after flying at most, and this shooting execution may be interrupted or you use it in the center of the strange tide.Frames, but the enemy has been stinging for you when you execute it, you are lucky, and you will die directly, and the shooting is executed at most back to one grid. I said that you are crispy as a paper 1 grid.

In other words, the producer is a set of zombie world wars. If you see a friend who commented on my comment, if you are not brain -residual or want or like Thai and Sky Elite TroupeIt is really recommended to refund and then attach the original surgery three items below

Tendon coil: Even with the constitution far beyond ordinary mortals, an ordinary interstellar warrior will still have a lot of risks to fight with bare hands and air fists.The tendon coil can greatly enhance the body's surface skin and muscle strength of an original Star -over warrior. A mortal unresolved mortal may not be able to penetrate the metal shell of the chariot or a reinforcement soil.Walls, but the original Star -made soldiers can do it in a normal state.In addition, reinforced muscles and skin can better protect the organs and implants in their bodies, especially the black crustal connected to the power armor.

Holy Poor pituitary: This leaf -shaped plant with the size of the thumb nails will be implanted into the core part of the brain.Its biggest effect is the existing organs in the original casting Star Warrior, especially the enhancement of bones and muscles. This is why the original Star -made soldiers are generally higher than that of ordinary interstellar soldiers.It is worth mentioning that this implanted organ was originally designed by the emperor himself to make the original body. Kobe himself only retains the part of the right half of the brain. As for the drawings on the left half of the brainEssence

Belizerlus furnace: This organ that has been sleeping in normal times is called ""the person who dies"", and it connects two hearts at the same time.When the original Star -made soldiers receive a high -intensity spiritual impact or trauma, it releases homemade chemicals similar to anti -stimulant. These chemicals also help the wound regeneration and wake -up consciousness.After activating for a period of time, the glands will enter the dormant state again, because it takes time to secrete and supplement the substance to activate it again.Many of the original Star -made soldiers, including the original casting leader team leader Calga, escaped the magic claws of death because of this organ.Author: Emperor Emperor Poison Blade Source: Bilibili














----------------------------------------------------------------------- The following comments are comments that only started playing on September 6th
What do you say after playing overall? It is difficult to say that the production level of European and American games is really average

I was looking forward to it at first and after reading the leak version, I looked forward to it.

The first is the problem of EPIC. I also installed that thing but I didn’t be updated by anything or I would not download it.Very easy to turn equal to no

Next, the game content optimization was very slow at first, and then the CG result of the first paragraph of the game actually stuck the problem or loaded the problem anyway.There is no special problem when it is smooth

Then there is the feeling of feel and the difference between the first generation. First of all, you have no execution of the blood combat. The execution of the pistol will be interrupted anyway. I have been interrupted.It's all from a key pair, that is, your mouse. You can quickly lightly press and stabilize. It is a hit. This causes you to contact me with melee. Sometimes it is not flexible.at this point

Then the problem of executing is that the pistol counterattack is that you can escape or block the successful block that can trigger a shooting counterattack some elite enemies can be twice and then the miscellaneous soldiers are basically the block.It is a shot to get a shooting execution, but this shooting execution is embarrassing. Sometimes when is it embarrassing? It must be the end of your current action when you are in the enemy group.You can force the action to enter the execution. This will cause you a trigger button that you have already shot the enemy and the enemy that has appeared in a melee hit.Just shift the position or the enemy is beyond the range or directly determine that it fails to trigger, which causes you to be beaten by the strange operation.

In other words, the remote execution and your movements have a problem with your movement. If you can directly make an image, you can immediately interrupt the current action.


Next is the online mode part of the PVE. You did n’t customize the picture given you the picture. It seems that there is only one to play a total of 6 pictures and then play a game anyway.The liver's weapon requires material anyway, I didn’t see it anyway, just right, it may not give you the experience of the 0 Legion Skin, you can get the experience that you can get the customs clearance to unlock it, but the elite installation must clear the specific requirements. For exampleAh

In general, it may be that except for the customs and the characteristics of the skin and the characteristics of the weapon.The key to hit the button is not as good as the first generation of the first generation.

I just want to say that I have n’t intended to play on September 9th on September 9th. If you are not hammered, my suggestion is a refund war hammer 40K game. This one can only be regarded as mediocre.Dark Horse But it seems that this game can be played, but it is not necessarily more fun. Friends who have thought about the plot. I suggest that if you are discounted, it is estimated that it will be discounted for about half a year.Just buy the game",2024/9/6,zh-cn
Brokeback Morgan,0,18,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Menua/,"I know I going to be on the unpopular side here, but I just want anyone thinking of buying the game to get the chance to see a review that tells it like it is.

I have never played a 40k game before, so without any passion or connection to the universe, I only can judge this game off of what it provides to me. This game is... not horrible, but it certainly isn't great either.

The campaign is short. Very short by today's standards. Like 6 hours, short. I finished in one sitting after work. Now, this isn't horrible, but it since the campaign is arguably the best part of the game, it being that short doesn't really bode well. Fun combat, great visuals, and an entertaining story... that you'll be done with at the end of the day.

Multiplayer is, well, not as great. The operations are interesting at best, monotonous at worst. You essentially get to play through a co-op mission of the campaign as the ""B-team"" that you would always order to go do stuff. It provides an interesting and new perspective, but is certainly nothing great. The ""endless"" war multiplayer, I.E the PvP, is fun for about, well, 2 days. Afterwards you realize you only have 3 game modes on 3 maps. It gets repetitive instantly.

Now I know what you're gonna say, ""oh but there will be updates, and look at the roadmap!"". My brother, you are paying $60 at least for a 6 hour campaign and lackluster multiplayer that you will get tired of in two days.",2024/9/7,en

thelukygamer17,1,42.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199121782677/,"First of all, the game is extremely short, the countryside are barely about ten hours and it matters a lot that you want to redo the same 6 coop missions dozens of times to unlock the cosmetics and level the 6 classes with their respective weapons (I have not tried the PVP and I don't think I will do it shortly), but it is really fun and despite having only 6 missions to be repeated and repeat they do not become boring immediately thanks to the randomness of the spawn of enemies and resources, the combat is wellStudied, the final moves are spectacular and the weapons are all more or less useful based on your playstyle.In addition, the fact that there is no Wake contamination is absolutely a huge value.
Having said that, I can say that the game is an excellent game even if, for the lack of content, I would wait for some discount to buy it if you do not care to support the Devs and to give a sound lesson to the SBI and to those who lose money with money",2024/9/10,it
Seortan,0,21.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992417260/,"At the moment:

At high levels, the game turns into Elden Ring: endless dodgers and rolls.Not difficult, but just not fun.

Bolter weapon is absolutely useless.The plasmagan is useless.Numerous weapons are mostly useless.

Meltagan is better than all other options due to a lot of damage and restoration of even lost health if you have at least a bit of white.

Some classes, such as an attack aircraft, are just worse than other options: what is the point of it if Vangard does everything better than him?Jetpak is very naval.

Lock class in operations is a very stupid solution: do you want to play highly difficult?Swear 2 classes at least otherwise you will stand for 5 minutes in peeps with another tactician in the detachment.

The balance of opponents is very strange: Tzaangors with shields withstand a power fist in the face with a blow.A simple warrior of Nidov withstands 4 shot of Meltagan in the face.The enemies are very accurately shooting and refusing to fight in close combat even close, preferring to back and shoot while the player has to swing forward, since most of the weapons of near -battle do not have a moment in attacks on attacks.

The gameplay design is very strange too: what is the point of Gan Strike if the invulnerability window is so small?What is the point of it if the simplest tyranids remove armor in 1 blow?The mechanics of the parry is cool but only works in 1 by 1 or 2 by 1. More?You can not even try.Plus, why fend to parry when the dumts do the same thing only work on red attacks that cannot be spaced?

PVP is generally quiet horror: Vangard is the most broken class.Hook-> You shoot point blank from the carbine and win duel 1 on 1 with any class.Against Bulvarka, you just bother and make a hook again if it raised a shield.Most of the long -range weapons have above the traffic police than the near -battle weapons, so it’s better to just shoot at point blank range because there is no animation interruption.Therefore, at the moment, PVP is just running around and shooting from carbines at point blank range for the most part.

Campaign: in general, it is well done, but if you play 3+ difficulties, then again the Elden Ring turns out and not the cosmodes simulator that spoils the sensations.The bots are absolutely useless and stupid, therefore, you can not even count on them.

Castomization: generally good.Colors and the ability to combine colors are very cool.The current pieces of armor for each class look good but frankly little.In fact, the last shooting range of cosmetics is just the 1st shooting range hung with seals and other things.In general, I would like more.

Operations: In general, interesting.But the absence of the director of Ishishka is felt.They become very monotonous literally on the 4th entry.The absence of specialists and a greater variety of elite opponents affects the general impression negatively.Plus, again, due to high complexity, you often just run past the opponents to the elevator/script since the economy of health and armor is absent on high difficulties in operations.If we talk about the characters' builds, then everything is scarce here.There are no gameplay elements in pumping weapons and classes.Very dull ""5% more damage"" or extremely rarely something in the spirit ""get 1 full store at low health levels.""

In general, I am disappointed with how I came out cm2.They should work hard on the gameplay design and the behavior of opponents and a common balance.At the moment, people like everything, but these problems will begin to beat very much along the life expectancy of the game literally a month after the release if you do not make changes.",2024/9/10,ru

NixEmotions,0,20.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nixemo/,"I am quite impressed with this game both in terms of its gameplay and visuals after finishing the introduction. I'm excited to start playing the rest of the game in co-op with my sister. However, I cannot ever recommend a game that forcibly installs unnecessary Epic Games bloatware on your PC upon initial launch. I bought* a Steam game to play with other players on Steam only. (*Well actually, my lovely sister gifted me the game, but my statement remains otherwise the same. Thank you so much, sis! ^-^)

Fortunately, as long as you don't care about crossplay, the game is entirely functional without Epic Games Online and it can be easily removed from the installation. Here's how to do so.

1) Launch the game. The game will immediately attempt to install Epic Online Services. Cancel the installation box before it finishes. You will be met with an error message upon reaching the main menu. The EOS was never successfully installed, but remnants of the software are still on your machine.
2) Turn off crossplay in the game options menu of the game.
3) Close the game. Uninstall Epic Online Services from the list of programs on your computer.
4) Delete the Epic Online Services folder from the game's installation folder in your Steam library.
5) Reboot your computer and relaunch the game. The game will greet you with the error message when you reach the main menu whenever you start the game, but EOS will never again attempt to install itself on your machine. The game is fully functional without crossplay. Enjoy Space Marine 2!",2024/9/10,en
YuGo_Wolverino,1,13,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ydemonhunter/,"Pros:
+ The campaign, though short, is very fucking@.
+ Armor seems really heavy and this reflects on combat.You feel the weight in the gameplay.
+ The combat is intense, heavy and slow (in a good way) and so it is almost strategic.Space Marine 2 combat is a little Gears of War and Darksiders 1. A half an old school footprint.
+ Horde of enemies.
+ COOP mode.You can play the whole campaign in Coop.You + 2 friends.
+ Excellent art direction.The scenarios are beautiful.
+ Good graphics.
+ Good soundtrack.
+ This game has more testosterone than all Ubisoft games together.
+ The sealing of ""Games Workshop"" (company responsible for the Warhammer franchise that today embraced the Woke culture) did not arrive in Space Marine 2, a game developed by Interactive Knowledge.So Space Marine 2 respects the franchise lore.

Cons:
- Short campaign.The campaign can last 6 ~ 10h, depending on the difficulty and the way you play.
- Blood effects, when you shoot enemies or shatter they are very cartoonish.It could be a little more realistic.But this is just a matter of personal taste.But the gore of the game is still very good.
- Despite a very good amount of horde of enemies, they have few variations.
- The ""Operations"" (PVE) and ""Eternal War"" mode (PVP) are just repetitions.If you want to extend the time hours you will play these modes until you get tired.For those who, like me, don't care about PVP, it's even less content.
- Gold and Ultra editions (are clearly content taken from the base game so that they can sell these stupid editions for an exorbitant price)
- Season Pass.And the Seasons to come.These are more content taken from the base game, in order to extend the life of the game.
- Battle pass at game singleplay is the clown's cuh!
- Pay to play before.The infamous Early Access (or Early Unlock).Ubisoft and ea doing school.

The stats for powerfist look bad but yet im watching people 1 shot any class with it even heavy and bulwark classes. So youve put a talentless weapon on a low skill class. Either the power fist needs heavy nerfs to oblivion or you need to nerf bulwark so that its shield can only take so many hits before needing to recharge similar to heavy class in pvp. Theres no reason a class is having god mode in a frontal cone and then just 1 shotting people on repeat. Fix this and you earn your thumbs up back.,2024/9/10,en

The combat is good but can be a bit janky, especially the melee combat. the control scheme isn't great for mouse & keyboard and was obviously designed with console controllers in mind. I had a few weird bugs, including character/weapon/enemy models becoming invisible & connection issues trying to play operations with a friend, but i appreciate it's still very early days and these will likely be fixed. i'll almost definitely come back to this game in future if/when they add more content, but currently it's far too expensive for what you get.",2024/9/9,en
Wasavi,1,41.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001849291/,"I'm worried about this game, but what is the specifications of Co-op?Review for people

・ CO-OP will be able to select if you can clear the stage of the first campaign
・ Weapons that can be used with co-op are determined for each class
・ Enhance the class by consuming park points when the level goes up (passive)
・ One unique ability for each class (cool -down skill)
・ There is experience value for each weapon, and the weapon is strengthened at the point obtained by using it (with options)
・ There is a stray match
・ There is no trehan element that carefully selected with random drops of weapons like Warhammer Darktide
・ The stage is 6 in all at the moment x 4 difficulty levels
・ The length of the stage is about 30 minutes
・ Even at the time of Easy, it is difficult and dies
・ It seems that the types of enemies that appear on the stage will increase when the difficulty level goes up

It is a shame that there is no carefully selected element, but there is also a unique element,

Do not go play in the PVU mission until you go 2-3 plot missions, you will encourage the whole team rink, the game hardcore.

The plot is here for a checkmark.
It is needed only for fans and to get acquainted with mechanics (including classes).
The whole plot is training and preparation for pv.


✅
Hordes of mobs, blood, dismemberment.


✅
2k, ultra, 50 FPS with the initial scaling (the minimum).
6750 GRE.

True, the number of loading screens infuriates.


✅
I thought that it would be possible to flee the “hut”, but here it is very necessary to think about what to do.

Your reaction is often checked.
Make an ideal parrying, perfect evasion.

As a reward, you get an armor cell.


✅
You have few HPs, enemies have a lot of damage, on the most easy complexity in the PVU mission, you demolish 50% of your HP per blow.

This is interesting in that you become dependent on the team, you cannot pass the mission if you play everyone for yourself.

Only Esta can be srack ... Oh, with syringes that are scattered in the corners.

For a sniper, a position is important, because the sniper is cotton and Aim is important for a sniper.
The amount of armor depends on the class.

He is not even bad for the online game, but his missions are “defending the generator” and conditionally in one mission, you protect something from the hordes of enemies 5 times.

For the plot, they could have come up with something more interesting, the puzzles are different.

There is no progression in the plot, all the pumping in PVU missions.
PVE mission is more interesting than plot, with unique bosses and weather conditions.
What is the epic mission with the dragon, which waters the whole of Loku with fire.


⚡
Only 50 gigs weigh the game.
The locations are beautiful, in design, but textures are 2015, because even Assassin Odyssey has cooler schedule.

Models are plasticine, it is very well noticeable in the hair from which the light is reflected.
Light from the hair.


⚡
It does not affect the gameplay, but affects immersion.
She is not.
You touch the barrel - the barrel flies away to the next location.

Huge doors that weigh several tons open like plastic doors.



❌
At the moment, the game has 6 PVU missions.
You pass them all on hardcore - count the whole game.
Then you just have to pump each class by reprising the same missions in which the same script.


❌
Ugh.
Firstly, the game has few surrounding sounds.
Secondly, those that have no volume do not have spatiality.
Shots do not give vibration.
The Topot of Armor is also from 2015.

The music is invisible.


❌
Very scarce.

Big minus of the game.
In classes, the choice of 3 main weapons (which can be repeated in different classes)
And 1 slot under a mile + 1 slot for a pistol, where there is no longer a choice.

That is, playing for a sniper, I can not choose 2 and 3 weapons for myself, other classes have the same.
You are running about what they give you with.

In general, weapons are about 15 types and this is such a weapon
""Bolt-1"" store 12 rounds, damage 4.
""Bolt-2"" store 36 rounds, damage 2.
""Bolt-3"" store 500 ammunition, big return.


❌
Chelles immediately register PVU mission without understanding the mechanics of the game, they are killed - and they are pushed.

We need punishments for exiting the match and a restriction so that the people with 1 lvl do not buy for high complexity.


❌
Strong hack
A rare skin of weapons - the seal hangs at the trunk.
Legendary - printing hangs at the trigger.

A rare eyebrow skin is a white rope.
The legendary is a red rope.
The rope hangs in the same position.


❌
I would like to get acquainted with the universe of the Bestiary?
What are we behind the detachment?
What are these enemies?
Why are we fighting with them?
Where did they come from?

The game has audio-diapers, and that’s it.(by the way, they are well spelled out, in the style of the story of stories, and not someone’s thoughts)


❌
I contribute to any plot.
""It must be some kind of mistake""
""I will not stop until I kill everyone to the last.""

A bunch of clicked phrases that are used in games and films for ""discharge of the tense moment"".
I catch a wild cring from this.


❌
It was 2024, the developers of the games still did not know how to prescribe intelligence neither mobs nor allies.

Bota except to raise you can’t.
Enemies do not trigger on them, deliberately run up and run to the players.
The bots themselves cannot execute stunned enemies and stop shooting at them.
The bots as a whole cut damage and increased survival.


❌
SCM - sight.
PKM - Mile's blow.
C - parrying

I would make SCM - Ulta, PKM - sight, Q - a blow of miles.


❌
Wait until the dialogue passes (in the PVU mission, which needs to be passed 20+ times).
Wait until you get up on the elevator.
Wait until the door opens.

It beats very much on the pace.",2024/9/6,ru

The Mogician,0,60,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198851368116/,"Very tough decision for me to give this a not recommended review, but I think there are some glaring issues that should be addressed.

First off, the pros:
1. It looks great. Starting from the bigger things. The game is set on three very different and distinct planets: Kadaku, a jungle world, Avarax, a hive world and Demerium, a cemetery world. Each of the planets have their very own distinct style and feel to it. Then down to the smaller details. There are a lot of details in the game that also breath life into the game and adds to the whole WH40K experience. Bravo.
2. The gameplay is great. If you enjoyed the first space marine game, odds are, you will enjoy this one as well. The melee and shooting all feel very satisfying. Popping off a headshot or pulling off a finisher all feel very satisfying.
3. The story is pretty good. I mean, Warhammer games are not always known for having interesting stories, especially also considering this game is supposed to be a hack and slash kinda brainless fun game. All in all, I enjoyed the story thus far. Additional points go to the fact that the coop missions are also parallel to the main missions.

Next, onto the cons:
1. The story is a bit short for its price. There are 7 main story missions (8 if you count prologue) and 5 coop missions that will help flesh out the main story missions (6 if you count Ballistic engine, which isn't really mentioned anywhere in the main missions). I did the game on Angels of Death difficulty and it should take about 15 hours to complete. If you count the coop missions in, it should take about 25-30 hours in total if you wanna enjoy the whole story at least once. Slightly on the short side for the price they are charging.
2. It can be a real grindfest. Tying into the last point. What it does not have in length, it makes up for the sheer amount of grind you will need to do. To unlock all the armor sets for each class, you need to play 35 matches per class, with a total of 210 matches. Assuming you don't do PvP like I do, let's assume each match takes 30 minutes (I think that's the bare minimum unless you do speedrun), and you win every single match. That is like 100+ hours right there that requires you to grind. Now, I'm not against having a lot of coop time to pad out the game time, but since there are only six maps, things can get stale real soon. I hate doing comparisons, but If you compare it with games like Vermintide 2. Vermintide 2 had 13 missions in total when it first launched, which will ensure a relatively healthy mix of varied missions. Here's hoping the devs would add in more coop missions down the line.
3. Twitch drops. Really? I mean, all the clown awards that went into the announcement post should be telling. It is one thing to do exclusive twitch drops that requires you to watch it (since you can just leave it in the background), it is altogether another to require people subbing and giving out subscriptions. This is toxic.

All in all, I enjoyed the game itself, but I really do not enjoy some of the other decisions the devs made for the game.",2024/9/10,en

Epic Online Service is forcibly installed at the first startup, so if you don't cross play, you need to erase it manually.By the way, if you put it in something other than SSD, it will not work properly
The RAM 16GB is exhausted, so it is better to make it 32GB or more.Recently, in an environment where you buy a PC for APEX and use Discord, it will be quite barely possible, so it is better to add it for future games.

What is the story?
If you don't know Warhammer40K, the story seems to be a bit off, but if you want to know more, you'll step into the miniature game, so don't think about it.
To briefly explain this work

Easy to get rid of because the locust has come.

What is the battle system?
Not open world.The stage format does not get lost like a black myths Goku.
Basically, it is a gun called Volter and two guns picked up, and one melancholy weapon, so the width of the equipment is small.
It's a style that fights while avoiding a big turn, Parry, and fighting while counters.
If you defeat the enemy, the armor will recover, so it will be an aggressive play like a space marine.
It feels like a reflexive nerve, but there is a warning of blue, yellow, and red, so if you use the button pocket, it will do it automatically.
The person who cares is not suitable because it is an appropriate adjustment as usual.

If you are not used to pushing in the mouse wheels and doing ADS, it is a way that everyone will suddenly start swinging close weapons.




Q. Isn't it expensive?
A. Miniature is cheap because it is a similar amount of money.
It covers more than one space marine and tiranide, so it's worth 150,000 yen for 10,000 yen.
I'm too used to free games.(While distributing gold editions with gifts only for pre -access on the 4th)

A. If you do another thing while waiting for startup on the start tab, it will not work.When crashing in a movie after the game starts, make sure that the preset is not low.Since the image quality is different for the first movie, it is better to change it to 1920*1080 and read it all into the memory.Since the memory performance may be low, it is possible to pause at the moment the planet is reflected, wait for about 1-2 minutes, and then play it to proceed smoothly.If it is about 150,000 PCs, it is a cheap memory, so it is slow to load.After breaking through the movie, set it.
Especially in the case of a PC with the minimum request, it is better to leave it because it will be 8GB of memory, so it will be slowed down.If you play with 8GB at this time, you should be in Apex Legends.Please praise it because I bothered out the memory.Praise.

If that doesn't work
Use the tricks of FORZA HORIZON5 to skip the Internet line and skip in an offline environment.I don't know anything else.Anyway, Abust

Lower the setting of the cloth movement in the settings.It seems that the flags and receipts on the shoulders are also eligible.After that, there is a feeling that all data is stored in the memory and loading in the memory, so it is better to increase the memory.
Other than that, I think the blue bear is the same reason as Elden Ring.
You may be happy if you change the EAC's affireness rule and change it to a CPU single core.I don't want to be multiplayer.It is better to wait honestly


This is not a space marine but a stealth marine!It occurs if the memory of the grabo is the minimum requirement (4GB, etc.).Friend memo
・ The GPU driver ver confirms the latest.
・ For some reason, it will not be drawn in the preset low setting, so even if a warning appears in the middle setting, it is ignored and changed manually.
・ In the preset FSR low texture, it can be managed.
・ Low texture with 60fps limit.If you are worried, change the others to lower
・ If you use TAA, it will disappear even if it exceeds the grabo
If it is not solved by ↑


It's about to be a correction or a gravo is the minimum requirement:



Q. What is the strength of Space Marine?
A. Compared to general soldiers, the difference between the dragon ball nappa and Krillin is strong to some extent.

Q. Isn't the gun weak?
A. The size of the ammunition is not a 5.56mm like a common FPS, but it is almost the same size as the ""can with black and green vertical lines"" sold at the store, so it is a super high power.
By the way, general soldiers who fall around use a bullet of the size of a can to give wings from a common bullet.
It's simply a bad opponent.

The person who was a heresy, but he was shooting a shit -don -cavalter without reaction.If you know the strength of that, the partner of the heresy inquisite officer is the play party.I'm glad I didn't marine in the dark tide.The haste was suppressed.

Q. Why do you want to sortie with a small number?
A. 100 Space Marine is a division class force, and it is difficult to increase the number of training so that the development is not rebuilt in 10 years, so there is a shortage of personnel and overwork.It is quite poitizing because anyone as a super earth is not adopted if anyone volunteers.By the way, armor is handmade by craftsmen and productivity is scum.
It is chased and it is heavy and big, and only a few people enter the transport aircraft.
The single combat power is originally high to make up for the drawback.
For some reason, if you are beaten several times in the game, you will die.

Q. I have a receipt on my shoulders
A. I often call it a receipt because I forget the official name of that.You can use a receipt.
It's a purity seal or a pretty seal.The point is the same as a commendation to get the top sales of salesperson.

Q. What is a mechanical spirit?
A. To put it simply, it is a bad operation such as bugs and bugs.Since the technology to correct is gone, prayer is greased and discharged and cooled by leaving it with the feeling of ""not broken ..."".

Q. Is Space Marine a high -tech soldier, right?
A. Actually, if you look at that world standard, it seems to be slightly out of date.

Q. What about Dreadnote Senior?
A. You can beat 205p


Q. Maybe black
A. I changed a lot a while ago.

Q. What are the 18 functions in the conversation after the tutorial?
A.




















Q. Isn't it black after all?
A. So I changed a lot

Q. What is the operation mode COOP?
A. There is no private lobby.Since the class is not allowed, I participate in the stray, host, and collect friends, but if I wear a class except for the host, I will not match the class forever, so I will wait for a match while changing the rolling class.Whether the host runs down and goes down with the participation of Nora, or whether the stray that is hosting and proud of it is no longer down, or to make it a pseudo -private lobby.

Q. I haven't touched the pvp, but don't you do it?
A. If private lobby is implemented, it will be done by 12 people, so there is no interest in it.I know that the balance is garbage with DOW.I know that Gears was broken with a similar concept, so I'm not interested in it.
I'm interested in a rugged arena like Quake, but I don't want to play with a group like a kilmontage that is as exciting as a chirmontage from a recent APEX, but I don't want to play it.
If 1vs1 is implemented, I think it will be done in earnest.


By the way, Wai is



If you don't touch the campaign except for fun.
After clearing, the fact that the campaign is not useful as a means of games and character development is a tutorial, a slightly outdated PvE Matchmaking mode, and a customization for character progress and representability.
The easiest to understand when WH40K is a mode similar to Darktide, and at this time there are only six maps.I think the minimum required is because we are trying to provide multiple types of modes.PvP is garbage.I don't think I'll do it again if I get a performance

The biggest difference from other coops is the battle game play that works with different flow of conversion/counter, avoidance, bean guns, and general combat flow.
For the first one or two hours before actually getting used to it, I thought the battle was a bit subtle.
Timpo, attack priority, differences in play style with weapons you have, it will be fun as you get used to it.
In operations mode, team play is required, and the higher the difficulty, the more leveling is required, and the verbal communication is required.In the stray, Wai was the above COOP complaint.Even if you fail, you can get experience, but I want to run solo and earn at once.

Those who are complaining about the battle think that they are not used to the operation.
It will be fun if you have the core of the game and the operation skills, but if you can't do it, you can refund it.

I don't know if it's attractive, but the setting and the overall art design are fine.
The design of the environment, architecture, and character (mainly space macrinko) will be the best space marine experience enrollment and miniature painting materials if you have a PC with sufficient performance.

If you are interested in all content, such as campaigns, coops, and PVPs, I think this game is worthwhile to the current price.If you are interested only in Coop, it may still be worth it, but it is recommended to wait until the content is a little more fulfilling (probably cheaper on sale) PvE is almost like a replay.So, looking at the roadmap, I don't think this will change, and there are different purposes for each map, so I hoped that I could experience different experiences with the same map, so I thought that 6 maps would be fine at the beginning of the release.
I didn't expect to be six fixed missions without replay value.

In the sense of replay, you should search for games like Border Randes 2 and Remnant 2.

I was also very satisfied with the way of proceeding with the campaign to go straight and go straight without a puzzle or way.It also fits well with the combat style and the game atmosphere.Each space in the battle is also overwhelmingly beautiful, and the decorations that care about every corner of the corners make it impossible to take your eyes off.The culture and design concept reminiscent of the Holy Roman Empire are also interesting sights.

The campaign is not very long because you can see the ending for about 8 hours, but the end content is separate from PVE and PvP.There are weapons that have not been used in the campaign, and various technologies are added, so it is different from the campaign, and if you grow all six jobs, the play time will increase tremendously.It wasn't my taste because it was too repetitive, but if you enjoy the process of repeating it for character growth, you can usually enjoy it.

This is a very desirable case of Warhammer's digital games that have not been able to achieve this as well as IP -based games.The satisfaction may vary depending on how much of the Warhammer series and the preferred macho characters and combat methods, but I think it is a game that is worth playing even if the campaign is not a game.

A 3 Minute Review of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. An incredibly satisfying and highly detailed sequel. Support the channel, become a member!


Written Review
Space Marine 2 is a highly-polished and satisfying sequel to the original 2011 game.

This is one the coolest looking 40K games I've played. It truly immerses you in its grimdark world with its stunning environments, attention to lore, meaty audio and intriguing narrative.

The game comes with three modes, the first being the campaign, which is playable solo, or in a 3 person squad with friends. It follows Titus, the protagonist from the first game, as he embarks on missions to take out a new Tyrannid threat.

Each of these missions have you fight through a variety of level layouts with their own unique aesthetic. As you progress the campaign and explore slightly off the beaten path, you'll gain access to a decently-sized arsenal of weapons that come with unique movesets and playstyles.

Space Marine 2 trains you to continuously juggle between ranged and melee combat, as different enemies will have different weaknesses that you need to take advantage of. Ammunition is more scarce than you might expect, and you won't be able to take out an entire horde purely with your guns.

There are many bigger enemies that fight you up-close, and parrying their attacks, and breaking through their defences with your melee weapon can prove to be your most effective means of taking them down.

Melee combat feels great, and comes with a good number of combos and freedom. It also has a very important role in keeping you alive, as executing low-health enemies grants you some armor and regenerates recently-damaged health.

This dance throughout combat was incredibly satisfying to me, and as you get better at it, you really feel empowered. Despite this, it felt like I could die in any fight. I was often barely hanging by a thread by the end of combat, at least on the game's recommended Veteran difficulty. Missions are long and arduous, but in a good way, and due to this continuous struggle, success was very fulfilling.

The second game mode is called ""Operations"", and is also a 1-3 player PvE mode. It includes unique missions separate from the campaign, where you can play as distinct classes with their own unique abilities. The cool part here, is that there is some meta progression. As you play, you can upgrade your weapons, put points into your skill trees, and unlock new cosmetics.

The third game mode is called Eternal War, and is your relatively run-of-the-mill PvP mode, with expected game modes like deathmatch and capture points. You play with the same class types mentioned in Operations. It can be quite fun, but in my opinion, is not the main attraction of the game.

Overall, I think Space Marine 2 feels wonderful to play, and is an absolute blast with friends. The attention to detail, and weight in everything you do really makes it a joy to play.",2024/9/9,en

Tech Marine,0,129.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TecMar/,"In the game that I expected in 24 years, the parasites like the parasites, so I was like Genomov.
Forced the third party party.
Omnicia eagerly praying to get off Epic and the head of Natus in the head.

Even if you try the tutorial, it's a lot of fun and fun for 40K fans.
Although the developer is different, you can feel that it has been developed for the fun of the previous work.

However, as mentioned above, except for some game problems that are lacking or unfortunate
The initiative pick catches the ankle of the game.
Even the same as in the local army,
There are a lot of people who are cut in the entrance thanks to the pick -up system like dog disease.
Incompetent and greedy, so many idiots Epic
Currently, 9.5 out of 10 non -thousand evaluations of the game is due to Epic.
Even if it wasn't just a pick, if the 40K IP's works were not those who didn't like it from the beginning,
More players (buyers) and evaluations would have been more

Because of dependence, the entrance cut or just attach the Epic Pak like me
People who don't like Epic so much that they can even come to a game of very favorite Warhammer IP

Above all, Saber Interactive and Picks
I needed a pick to run the game, but I didn't listen to it anywhere.
EGS EULA's unique peculiarity is a problem that is disadvantageous to all of the peculiar pikes
The game is executed only if you agree with the fucking terms of fucking picks that cannot be done.

Like the EDF6, these dirty picks are
As if the cancer spreads to your body, it will continue to bold the disgusting gestures.
Then, by the time Epic realized that it was a pick
There is a situation that becomes natural
Even in the local army
Netizes or chancho -chan, because they are the same cubs


--- After the October 17 patch ---
Since the previous five -day patch, the difficulty of the overall game has decreased so I thought it would be a bit of a hand.
Personally, it became a very unpleasant game
I think it may be that the damage reduction on the boss of the shameous melmela
You can also understand Ospaxes

In the end, whether Korea or the United States, he's a patch with nerfs as the result of his turn.
This is a real problem.
게임 좆창난다 싶으면 이새끼들은 진작에 도망가고 없는 새끼들인데
Not developers are playing games, but only their daughters and the sucking opinions of the chicks.
Big, we've only picked up unpleasant patches, but now it's just that way

If the distance between the fatal difficulty party is dropped
Armor made a picture that was stuck with a teamwork guide and an argument
Hierophanna, which is sprinkled with a dung board covering one third of the map
Like Elead Horde, which is steamed all the time in the Fat Shark's Fucking Tide series
If you avoid it with the quantity of the overlapping characters and rabies, you will be forced to fall.
It's not that armor is cut off when you're hit, but it's a dog that's not the same as the armor.

So there's nothing updated with Volkite, Dark Angel Bullwalk Skin
Even if you overcome the unpleasantness, not the fun difficulty of fatal difficulty,
There is no new grade of equipment, either Lelik or Master.
A few patterns that can't be unlocked by the cosmetics
Power Sword Skin Just Gis

In the meantime, even if you have the part of the recovery restrictions in the ammunition box
Still, even if the head magnification is still high in the idiot deal, the ware to trample the Warrigari step with a non -stop
Bolters have to shoot 2 or 3 shots in Guns, but they have no choice but to dry up 3 times.
As mentioned above, I made a difficulty, so rather than a variety of choices
Melta and Plasmagan's pick rates are easy to handle Horde.
If you hit Melta and Patan nerf again without the baller's upward,
These bastards are confirmed as they are no different from the Arrowheads.
You have to watch what will happen later
At present, it is an unpleasant nerf that is not an interesting difficulty
In the case of fatal difficulty, the Carrie itself is almost impossible in the case.

However, the Japanese translation is messed up, so it's better to be careful.

In addition, there are many places where you do not know unless you play the previous work.The hero's class was about the captain in the previous work, but was demoted for a so -called unrealistic crime in the previous case, and became a lieutenant.Because of that, the boss of this work sits in the empty protagonist's post, but I know that this guy is not as powerful, the battle result, and the hero's feet, so I put pressure on it.That's why.In addition, the protagonist is in the previous work, put into another unit in another place and should not be told to operating it there, but it is a person who does not know about the world view, such as rubbing with his subordinates.Is difficult to understand.",2024/9/8,ja

Lu λ,1,39.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GORDOCOMPUX/,"This game is wonderful;It is possibly one of the best titles that has come out this year, totally a 10 of 10. This game is a Gears of War type with several different mechanics, but in itself it is equally frantic.

Starting with my review: History continues in a certain part the story of its predecessor.While it is not necessary to play the previous one, it can be useful to understand certain aspects of history.Continuing with the story, it has a good way to develop, where each kinematics or new dialogue makes the story more catchy.In turn, the characters are very important in the development of the same story, since something that I like to make this game is to develop the characters of the main squad, as in the first game, giving them more weight without leaving them asideas bots that accompany you in the missions.The missions, whose characteristic is the perfectly set scenario that this game has, the graphics and the construction of scenarios of this game are beautiful.The scenarios are linear, but they have some construction that invites you to explore them and find quite useful things.In addition, the scenarios are quite intuitive.While the game has a compass option, I usually did not use it because of how intuitive the scenario and novel.
The enemies that this game possesses are quite varied and are placed very well in each scenario to avoid that feeling of repetitiveness that this type of games can give.Each enemy presents a different level of difficulty from the other, giving very important way to the change of constant strategies and the constant use of its Parry and Esquive system, a system that complements very well with the gameplay, which is very well polished andYou feel good to use.Maybe on the keyboard some keys of keys could improve a bit, but they are quite well in the same way.Returning with the gameplay, this is very similar to that of Gow, as I mentioned earlier, pure and hard frenetism where we will have the option of use of weapons to Melee, which have a combos system, or remote weapons options, which vary according toWhich ones you choose.Music is another complement to this beautiful Frenetism of gameplay, graphics and waves of enemies.The music of this game is beautiful and the Wh40K universe complements very well.
Although something that I did not like at all is the rare behavior that allied bots have and the little impact they can have on the gameplay.Another thing that I did not like so much is that the easy and normal difficulty feels very easy, while the difficult difficulty feels beautiful, and the last difficulty presents an interesting challenge.I recommend playing it in difficult, since it is where I felt the most enjoyed the game.Another thing in which this game falters is on stage.Things such as explosive barrels, useful objects such as ammunition or medkits do not stand out much in view, as well as breakable boxes seem an non -interactable element.

Similarly, this game takes my Goty vote, although this Wukong or Astro Bot hovering like other candidates, my fanaticism for the emperor prevents me from becoming a heretic.Undoubtedly, a solid masterpiece that is totally worth everyone, both for those who know wh40k and for those who do not.Fully recommended masterpiece, it is a rewarding experience and is totally worth its price.",2024/9/6,es

But let me try to do the first glance, abstracting a little from this.
Warning: there will be many letters.
To get started, my setup and the guide of the game:
• Ryzen 5-2600
• RTX 3060TI
• 8 GB of RAM
• Monitor 16: 9, Epic Games is preinstalled
• Preset “High” Ponsiece, for itself, nothing except the sensitivity of the mouse and buttons changed
• The level of complexity is high
And now to business and points.
Optimization.The first seven hours, the flight is normal.No problems, in general, well, at all.There are no personnel of personnel, stable FPS in the region of 50-60 frames, occasionally in especially large battles were felt, but they disappeared as quickly as they appeared.What is on my system with high settings, and so it was possible or something?
Graphics, since this is a very subjective point I will be brief.It is very beautiful and does not cut the eyes, which I was afraid when I was waiting for the game.
The gameplay, the good old ultranary, took something out of the first part, introduced fashionable finishing and God the emperor how good it is ....Ahem, excuse me, a large arsenal for killing beetles, both in distant and close range, weapons are very good for my taste, not of Destiny of course, but worthy.Blood may seem cartoon or jam to someone, but it did not bother me, my fighting brothers, too, in the process opposite when immersed, it is not even noticed at all.The game observes the pace quite well and in time alternates the gameplay from cutting minced meat in the forest to a leisurely walk along narrow corridors.At the moment, everything that I saw does not cause rejection, but rather literally causes a strong desire to play more.
The plot, and what is the plot, 7 hours of the game, early still.
A little about PVP.Is that unexpected, great?Well, that is, you most likely saw a PVP teaser, there it looked a little awkward and alapoisly or what?But when you go there yourself, uuuuu, hold my underpants, it is dynamic, interesting and (at this stage) it looks balanced (you can just keep silent about the lobby balax, this is a fiction, the rest is normal).The attack aircraft after the first part, of course, became less mobile, but this is as for me for the better.
So far, as if no minuses?Let's fix it and run through the minuses that catch your eye:
• The progress of the plot, if you play with friends, remains only at the host.That is, if you finish the game and want to continue, but you were not a player on which everyone was going, then if you please start from where you stopped.Thisoooo, very strange.For myself, I cannot attribute this to the minus, becauseI already see that I will go through the plot more than once or two, but for some of you it may be critical.
• network instability and departures (again at the moment).At the moment, you can throw you during the game from the lobby.If it throws up, then you can not count on an automatic reconnect and you have to drive the lobby code if you don’t have a person in your friends.But if you, like true fighting brothers, brought each other to Frend Liszt, then the button to join the game more than works.
• Управление, Да, для кого-то по первой это действительно может быть минусом, так что я настоятельно рекомендую при первом запуске подобрать кнопки под себя.Otherwise, your impression of the game can be greatly spoiled.
Yes, in principle, then everything is by minus for 7 hours of the game.Do I recommend the game?
To do this, let's divide the answer by two.
For the Vahafags - definitely his mother yes
For everyone else, it depends on your love for ultranasia and the visual style of this game.If you are one of those people who love games according to the type GEARS of WAR (without linking to the part), Doom, and Good of War for their combat component, then also yes.If not, I'm not sure you will like it.There is another option to raise the flag to touch the game very tightly, but I beg you very much if you like it, buy.Such projects are rare today.
I will also add one point to feel the game, I would recommend the first passage:
A) In a cooperative with someone, so the game is felt completely different, and in Solo you will already have time to play.
b) a high level of complexity.So the game gives you a challenge, which, I am sure, you can handle it and this will be more exciting.

Well, that’s all, it came out a lot for the first impression, do not forget that the game is now in the early access for those who pretended to the gold edition and above and there may be problems that can be fixed by the first day patch.I will wait for you on the battle barge brothers.After the full passage of the plot, I will update the review.

And remember
- What's is your Craft
- My Craft is Death

Update: Well, after another 40+ hours of the game from above, this time without verbosity.Guys, every time in the first, I rejoice like a cunt who was given a rattle, 11 out of 10 on the Great scale.After the plot, too, there is something to do, but here it is already for your tastes, for lovers of visual porn, the game and on the basic price tag will already be beaten out on the plot.",2024/9/6,ru
cyno,1,113,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199014583812/,"Well, I have an R5 5500, an RX 6600, 32GB 3200MZH, I clearly do not have the config for this game and yet, I do not chial because I had loading lag to the intro cinematics orOther, my game is on my nvme and it's niquel, I play in medium and a little high with balanced FSR and I have 80 FPS.
Those who complain are undoubtedly poor intelligence that come from the famous Call of Duty or other famous ""Game of the Year"".
A game is parameter and in the name of the emperor, learn to do it damn, the game is beautiful, enjoyable, without lag, it is a large Goty for my part.
I am currently playing with an angel friend of death and everything is going very well, it's super well balanced and have no lag or crash problems where I don't know what stupid excuse.
Focus to repel the release date, canceled their beta and I am delighted.This is a game that hadn't made me vibrate and pleasure for a long time.
In short, and I may come back to my opinion, this game is an emperor of humanity/10.
I leave you on this and I leave to exterminate tyranids by hundreds.
Good game and for the emperor !!!

I come back to my opinion to say that I finished the campaign as an angel of death with a friend and those only with a single bug that was easily bypassing.That said, to all those who chip because ""GNGNGN is too hard"" ""Gngngn is bugged"" or I don't know what bullshit, buy talent or a friend and do not piss off.Similarly for the perf, learn to configure your game because I had a single bad kinematics, nothing else.

I add, the campaign is a masterpiece much more advanced than many games, I am amazed with my friend and even being a young scout in the Warhammer world, it was a visual, auditory, psychological feast and IPass overnight (yes we rush the countryside in 1 night hush).Tell yourself, it's been a long time since I had seen NPCs fighting in a campaign, it was great not to feel alone hero of the Imperium, we had characters even without name with whom weBeaten and we loved it, it added volume without being soulless, the NPCs had life and that is not most of the studio of today's studio who would piss off for if can.Today, few studios arrive at the level of this mastodon and it's normal, passion, work and knowledge took over and the money has passed afterwards, that's for me mature studios.

I really thank Focus and Saber for this game, they deserve my money and I regret not having taken the collector.The passion was in order and even for the strangers of the estate is enjoyable.A huge congratulations and thank you to them.
(no I do not lick the balls because I know that there are PS players for that with their """" excluded """" ""so I don't worry about my vocabulary)
My note remains the same.
Thank you for everything.

Good to go, I add a paragraph for a little humility by saying a few negative points.
First, the operations are not doable in private between friends without a pegu at the microphone straight out of the ass of a Necron joins your game and gets fucked.Really, if it is to play with cowards that chip in difficulty 2/4 of the countryside, give me AI, it is much more effective.
Then, the online mode forced for the operation mode.Yes it is a little disturbing when you know that this game mode is a sandbox where the tyrants are less violent than the Mamie Yorkshire in minimal threat.
After that, and that's for Gold and Ultra editions.We do not have access directly to the armor included in season 1 because we must unlock them with the famous requisition points ...
Finally, and this one is a bit more personal, we do not receive any reward according to the difficulty in which we end the campaign.I do not ask for a Terminator or a blood care armor but at least a distinction, a title, a logo I don't know, just what to rejoice in our efforts.
This is a little humility and negative to prove that yes I know how to criticize but not by stinging like a young imperial guard who gets lifted by black Eldar.
I thank those who vote positive and reward my opinion, the emperor will reward you free of charge, thank you very much.Go, good game everyone and don't forget: the emperor protects !!!",2024/9/6,fr

Perroford,1,51.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gosqo2/,"The game is fun.With a heavy blow, Space Marine is a good way to use a heavy armor.The sound also forms a heavy and suitable atmosphere.The game system has a familiar system that avoids the paring of Sekiro and the unknown attacks.It is fun to slice the enemy while adding a single shot.The directing is also good, whether or not you like the existing Warhammer or not.Graphics are good and optimized.

But it's not enough to be a 70,000 won money game.The campaign is long but very repeated.It is a repetition of killing, moving, opening the door, killing enemies that do not change much.Even the boss war is only a reinforcement of elite enemies, except for the final boss, all of them are repeated again.There are some places that are even boring because there are few types of enemies.

The worst is the long -range enemy, but all of the distant enemies in the game are powerful, but they are as strong as the nearest enemies, they are not good at eating stiffness, and most of the long -distance horses of players are garbage levels.If you do a fire war, you can lose money.The tracking performance is also good, so even if you roll it, it will be hit by two or three shots, so the damage will be accumulated.The most fucking sound is Joan Sniff, but every time a developer's parents are curious once.Death's angel -based stamina is also in Grogi to put two or three magazines, but it is floating in the air, making it impossible to see other enemies when dealing with, and throwing a bulge projectile continuously.Most of these babies are paired each other, and when they start throwing the projectile with a stack, they are busy to avoid it.When you get a plasma insignator or Rasfusil, you'll be more stiff except for the super -distance weapon, Melta Rifle, and the firepower is also idiot.There are also extremely small means of recovery, but the ranged ratio is not small, so it is the main cause of tiredness in the game.

It is never recommended to make this game a difficult difficulty.The completeness of the game is not good, so no matter how hard it is, the difficulty is so lush that it is only seen as it was released.The distance above is very large, but the gun is more useless and the ranged ratio increases in the second half.If the enemies are fired and guns, they will taste hell. Allies are brain death, so even if you pinging to T, even if you are right next to you, you stand still and do nothing.As mentioned above, there are few means of recovery, but one of them is a slow speed, and it has to be sink kills to restore shields, and it does not fit for a long time, and the sink kills adds a sense of blow, but if it is too abused, the game is cut off.You have to keep killing, so it is a factor that continues to break the game flow.Increasingly, difficulty becomes a game that forcibly pushes checkpoints.After filling up, it's fucking stupid.Because of this, this game is not right for those looking for challenging and difficult games.The difficulty of this game is just irrational and boring.There's no reason to do it because it shows a special reward for clearing the game with the highest difficulty, and showing a minimum challenge and laziness without me.

In other words, the game has a great potential with attractive design and system, but unfortunately, it is a flat -ranged weapon that is close to Airsoft and a distant enemy that comes out of the fuck.It's better if you have a friend to work together.If you like Warhammer Franchise and you are more interested in Warhammer than the game itself, you can live.

The Emperor's Majesty prepared a lot.
The game itself is very fun.
The campaign came out in a total of 12 hours,
I don't know the Ohhamma story at all
Despite being a person, the immersion was enormous,
The fun of beating the mobs in one shot
To make the initial symptoms of hair loss disappear
It was cool.
But in fact, you can enjoy it longer than the campaign
The contents of it were the operation content,
There are 6 operational maps in this game, respectively.
Difficulty is also insignificant, average, difficulty, ruthless
It consists of 4 stages, so I
I only have this content for almost all day.
In particular, this operation mode, unlike the campaign,
Whenever we come back after breaking the maps, experience compensation and
Compensation for experience in weapon skills just used
And so that you can take a class and weapon characteristic tree
Because you can get the money you give as a reward,
From here, you can feel the fun of growth
I was missing from this time.
(Later, weapons that are often used
You can also upgrade with higher rating
In addition, the characteristic tree that exists in each weapon will be taken
It can be hard because it can be done)
(When you go around the battle map, always around
Wandering around the box, there
Armor, treatment, bullet, etc.)

However, it is a little unfortunate that the evaluation is currently wrapped up,
Fortunately, the reason is not a matter of the game itself
Without any communication or mention
Epic Online Service (EOS) program
Because it was forcibly executed,
This EOS is roughly cross play or matchmaking
Although it is a program used for,
This is rather performance problem or server connection problem
And a variety of technical such as game conflict
Swearing in that it generates an error
I think I couldn't eat it
In the end, the evaluation will slowly recover.
But I personally, I have an EOS problem
It's a problem, but the middle of the middle of the year
I wish the loading screens were solved a little faster

- Console with autism.(I recommend turning off the crossplay)
- Matchmaking working and at the same time.(It would be nice to exist the option to choose the region)

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 - Review

He had his delays.He had his leaks.He had everything against, but he is finally here.Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 is a reality.Everything that any follower of the Warhammer universe could expect.An explosion of testosterone.Frantic.Intense.Bloody.Wild.That Servo Armor reminded me of Gears of War.Fuck, as the Marcus is surprised and Dom. In GamePlay it is a high voltage carousel with excessive action quotas.A feast of shooting for any lover of shooters.Graphically it has phenomenal planes with a huge amount of bugs, but ... it begins to make noise when we put the magnifying glass on their faces or the environment itself.They look quite generic.Maybe that's why performance is so good.It has a brilliant optimization.Nor does it need too much equipment to run well.The levels are rather perpetual corridors.Anyway, Space Marine 2 is an action overdose, so much to leave in a coma after a few hours.The home of any shooter fan and terror of any hemophilic.


*Quite faithful to the Warhammer 40K universe.
*The return of Titus, a whole stoic macho.
*Ejambres and waves, leave amazing postcards.
*A curious crosses between Gears of War and DMC or Gow.
*That constant dose of adrenaline in your gameplay.
*The modeling of the Servo armor are great, but ...




*The faces are not the best.
*The scenarios seem to me something linear and that sense of verticality is lost.
*Some other pico of solo difficulty.
*Certain bugs or CTD as a product of incompatibility with some versions of MSI afterburner.

The PVE weapon value is that the shotgun is turned into a jelly bean launcher.

The number of supplies is a small number of supplies and rolled through the corner to pick up search for bullets.

The melee mechanism is to train dogs to simulate a full -scale red and blue box glittering vegetables.

Let's talk about the advantages first
The picture quality artist is excellent, the plot performance is okay, there is almost no bug (at least the individual does not encounter when playing), the personal 14th generation i7/4080s runs the highest configuration very smoothly, the whole process is very smooth, the whole process is 100 frames
Then talk about the disadvantage
The first and most terrible is the network. It was particularly obvious on the 6th of yesterday. PVE tried to start in the fast ten innings. Only three innings went in. The others were stuck in the ""loading server"" step.There are two games in the game that are very stuck and have a bad experience. The only game that is not stuck is because I am a host and no one can add the whole process. The PVP is a batch that can go in but stuck.Can't be hit at all.In the future, this game is mainly the Internet. The official is not good to manage the network. It is really terrible. The players can run you all. (Today, I played several games on September 7th.The reason for cross -platform online, the internet said that the cross -platform online has improved, everyone can try it). Then the difficulty and part of the level (enemy) design.Let's talk about the design of some levels. After playing, I know that the two places of the antenna guard and the elevator chain are purely innovative, and the spit fire and tearing worm will encounter brain insects.Personally, I feel uncomfortable when I hit the insects. Later, I was better when I was chaotic, and it started to be cool when I played.Then the IQ of the PVE mobile computer teammates is very mentally retarded regardless of the battle or PVE mobile computer teammate. It will not threaten the enemy, and will be led by the miscellaneous soldiers. The output is also low. The only advantage is that it is hard.Then the game is not low, the damage of the miscellaneous soldiers is not low, the elite strangeness is highly injured and controlled, and the shield is severe if there is little accident, and then the blood is still less.Go to jail.The last point is the problem of operation and feel. To be honest, the near -battle feel is not as good as the interstellar warrior, and then the key and mouse operation does not change the key position. It is very painful.Try the whole handle for a few days, after all, I haven't played with the handle, so it’s hard to talk about this.
It is probably these. Look at the operation and update after all, and may be updated afterwards. I originally expected the game to replace the dark tide or give at least pressure on the fat shark. Now it seems that the fat shark will continue to put it again.",2024/9/7,zh-cn

The plot, despite the fact that it is short, worthy.In any case, it does not have 3.14 Darasov, Lisbians and the like, I am only very grateful to the developers for this.
With optimization, everything is in order, there were not a single crash or some wild lags for my 75 hours, the FPS was stable 55-60 sometimes I saw a sagging up to 45, but it was not critical and I did not see any lags.
Unfortunately, at the moment there is not enough operations (only 6) they are quickly bored, but they seem to say that they will add, we will wait and hope)



PVP mode, well, what can I say when you play with friends, of course everything is fun when you went into the solo, it feels like people do not know what a team game is just a running herd of 6 people.I can’t understand why I can’t collect a Pati of 6 paratroopers and go to the PVP, why only 3 people know him.

The words are ahead
This game is led by two European giant game companies. It is developed and produced by the Saber Interactive Studio under Embracer Group, which is the development team of ""Zombie World War World War Z"";) Responsible for issuance.
When it comes to the game of WWZ, then you can naturally contact the in -depth cooperation between their studio and EPIC.The same is true for this time. The online method of this work is still equipped with an EPIC server, so when logging in, you need to perform an EPIC platform verification.
But this process is only verification, not the launch of the dual -platform, and when the individual starts, it does not require logging in to the EPIC account (individual has no EPIC account), so it is a lot better than another French company's experience.
And this verification service seems to block many players and become a pain point for playing.
There is such a method here. If it fails to enter the update for the first time, kill all processes with EPIC in the task manager, verify the integrity of the game, and then open the accelerator to accelerate the EPIC platform. Start the game and wait for the update again.
Update the service to verify this process, only once, once and for all!
When the prelude came to replacing the black watched cloak armor, and putting on this iconic blue extreme Star Warrior mech, the Zheng Chapter began!

For this work, I can use 16 -character simplified review: simple difficulty, highest picture quality, process operation, audiovisual feast!

When all the shooting action games began to design in the inside, the problem of solving puzzles, and stealth assassination to fill the game content, a classic and concise super -booming game was born like this.
Linear process, pay attention to cooperation, burst in one hand, jagged in one hand, shot at the same time, and saw the meat.
Worm tide stack, grenades round, big hard armor, rolling gear, duel for duel, return to shield back energy.
The flesh and blood of seven hours fly, the plasma explodes, the adrenaline is always operating, and there is no brain!
Whether it is a alien planet environment, interstellar warrior armor or the model of Tenlun insects, the art of art is large score, which is one of the most delicate portrayal series of works!
The game design is simple and clear, the ultra -light weapon system, almost invisible development system, low learning cost, continuous operation and smooth operation, and distinguish it to ARPG with ""brush"" as the core and forcibly delay the play time.Pure linear process shooting!What the player needs to do is to choose a career in the outside of the game, and assign weapons in the opposition.
In this way, the rhythm of the game needs to be accurate in order to allow players to resonate with brainwashing, and shout out the words ""Loyalty to Emperor Emperor"".
And this is due to the experience obtained in the research and development experience of WWZ!There are also the game content designs described below.
The clever weakening the resource supplement in the scene, and the number of ammunition that can be carried, so that the game uses the melee system with a melee system.
Cut the knife, you can quickly clean up the small bug stacked stacked;
The knife is cut, and you can capture the executable bugs in time to return to the shield for yourself;
The knife is cut, which can better get the cool play experience of full -screen plasma cracking.
If the handle is played, it will have a more detailed vibration feedback experience!
However, don't forget that remote weapons and throwing props are also useful attacking props, so there is a trigger effect of gun decision.
Just the design of the two attack methods of near and far away, it can make the game more inclined to multiplayer, designing different tendencies, to perform team cooperation or PVP confrontation.During the game, we allocate resources more reasonably.

""Hell Domestic""?""undercurrent""?Or ""Zombie World War""?
Maybe there are, but it is by no means suture, but the experience of experience!
This simple gameplay, the level of levels of the players, the moderate number of enemies, the design of the linear linear no -gear, and the more significant multi -person cooperation gameplay and a more delicate visual experience.Each one is considered to play with the players and look comfortable.
In this era, you can not play hell dives, you can not play dark tide, but as long as you like to travel or 40K, this is not the best choice for ""Battle Hammer 40K: Star Warrior 2""!",2024/9/10,zh-cn

This game represents the best generation adaptation of the game under the World View of Warhammer 40K. Whether it is the picture quality or action design, it is very eye -catching.Not only did the IP 40K, the position of the warhammer 40K in the player's mind, the production team also showed the players to the high level of the game industry again.

In this game, players will play an Astert (Titus) to lead their team to complete different task responsibilities, and their own monk brothers fell hard to frustration from the Tyron Zerg and treacherous conspiracyEssenceThe plot is smooth as a whole, and the character shaping is quite good.Please note that the following hidden text involves spoilers: In general, the plot is very good, just a little short, the single plot time is about 6 hours.

The PVE cooperation model can be regarded as an extension of the single -player battle.In a single plot, the background communication will tell players that the other Astart team is assisting us, and the PVE cooperation model is the team to assist players to complete the single -player battle.Players can experience battles in the background of the same task from various angles.This is similar to the Lyon and Aida lines in ""Biochemical Crisis 4"". Different battles that occur in the same background complement each other, which greatly enhances the player's sense of game substitution.However, it is a pity that there are currently certain bugs in the PVE cooperation model, such as difficulty matching and difficult to enter the game, and the liver is high. I hope that the sword can solve this problem before the game officially launched on September 9.

· The high level of gaming industry
· A variety of action design
· Excellent plot design and character shape
· The immersive battlefield atmosphere shaping
· Wonderful epic performance runs through
· Double -threaded plot experience with foot feature

· Single plot is not large enough
· There are less available weapons and equipment
· PC optimization is poor, not friendly for low configuration computers
· The cooperation mode is difficult to match, and the AI ​​teammates have to be optimized
· The difficulty of the cooperation model is high and low, and the experience calculation method is unreasonable

The game has just started service, and there are many problems that affect the game experience. Wait a minute, I have become a paid tester?IntersectionFrom time to time, the server that is stuck, response, and unable to join forever does affect the game experience, and this game has high requirements for computer configuration (very good for memory), and the computer is a little worse. This B optimize and complete the egg.You like this, how can I be loyal to the emperor?IntersectionIntersectionSword, talk!IntersectionIntersection(BYD, isn't there no soothing server soul?) The game uses a lot of beautiful and exquisite CGs, but you can't cut the instant calculations directly?And it is more regrettable that there are too few weapons and equipment that can be used in the game at present. A power sword is cut from the sequence to end.Update can make up for these regrets.Another point is that the high -intensity battle that has been around for 40 minutes makes me feel a little tired (looking back on the human transformation plan to take me one.

The standard version of the 249RMB of the national district is a little more expensive for ordinary players.However, considering the extremely smooth combat experience and unparalleled battlefield atmosphere shaping, according to the customs clearance of 6 hours, about 41.5RMB an hour, I watched a super movie. As a half hammer powder, I personally think that the price is worth the price.After all, this game represents the highest level of adaptation games under the Hammer 40K.
I generally don't like to give purchasing suggestions for the game, but this exception.
If you are a loyal audience with 40K war hammers, you don't need to say more.
But if you look at this game interesting, but you do n’t know the background story of the Warhammer 40K, then it is recommended to search for “Colonel Dacci” at station B. The UP homepage has a very detailed background story about the warhammer 40K.After reading it, you can buy it!Conversely, if GET is not available, then I suggest not to buy or discount.Because this game is an adaptation game, if you know a certain battle hammer 40K background story, it can greatly improve the play experience.

The battle hammer 40K can be adapted from the game from beginning to end. Although there are flaws, they are still flawless. The subsequent content updates. I personally hold a wait -and -see attitude. I hope that the sword will not learn the Sima arrow next door. I spend money.Cool.You do n’t show me the throw, and you do n’t give me cool. How do you make me willingly pay for it?It is hoped that the subsequent updated content can be like the single -player campaign in this game, which will bring players a vain experience.

While it doesn't run as well on my 4070ti as I'd like, this game kicks utter ass. It feels, genuinely, like a game from 2010. Both in good and bad. A singleplayer/co-op campaign, a PvE operation mode that has its own separate progression from it but ties into it narratively, and a pretty solid, no-frills-all-skill PvP classic arena-esque modes. A full package.

I almost forgot what it felt like to have a game release as a full package. Nowadays most games release with either the solo experience, completely a PvE coop one, or are PvP only. Most in the former camp have, at best, a small DLC of a mission or two to look forward to, and the latter is a microtransaction hellscape of every-other-month season passes. But here comes Space Marine 2, of a franchise I dismissed until recently, to give me it all. Visceral PvE combat against swarms of Tyranids both in campaign and the PvE operation mode (for a Halo nerd, seemingly very akin to Spartan Ops from 4) and the ability to shoot people's virtual, heretical avatars. And yet they promise more content to come, with a grand amount of customization to make your own little Imperium soldier spaceman.

I'm not going to say it's perfect. There's 6 PvE missions and as many, if not less, PvP maps and modes. But given the success so far and how good the final product is regardless, I'm going to put my faith we'll see that extra content. The season pass isn't a 10$ gate to a cosmetic progression system like everything else post-Overwatch, but rather the early 2010s version of a Season Pass. Which is to say, ""Give us 40 bucks and we'll give you the rest of our content later. Nebulous content we can't exactly assure you the quality of, but hey, it's coming regardless"". 10 years ago that version of a Season Pass was scummy, but maybe my will is eroded. I prefer that infinitely to 10 bucks for battle royale skins every 3 months. Like I said, it's a game that feels directly lifted from the early 2010's, and balance, especially in PvP, can feel a iffy (why can Bulwarks block my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bolt Sniper).

It makes up for it way more in what it offers though, and promises more to come in Marine Chapters and PvE/PvP content, a horde mode, et cetera. Easily a GOTY 2024 contender, and that's not just because it's been a light year. You'll swap from playing Gears of War third person shooting to Arkham countering and melee bashing on a dime, and cover yourself in excess gore as you do it. Easily recommended.",2024/9/10,en
Alekde,1,386.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alekde/,"Space Marine 2 is without a doubt one of the best games in the Warhammer 40K universe.It is a game we have waited for a long time because 13 years after a very good part of the first.With my head bowed, I immediately admit that I beat the game in July when it was leaked but that I knew immediately that I would buy a full version in the maximum edition, it justifies me a bit :) I just couldn't wait ...

Campaign

The campaign of the second part is a direct continuation of the fate of our hero from the first part despite the fact that about 200 years pass between them.It is realized with the expected momentum and perfectly fits into the framework of the entire universe.Blood, finishes or broken members are something that I define war in this world.Despite its linearity and corridor structure, and a focus on the same, i.e. continuous fight, completing it gave me a lot of joy.



The great colossus model was great and used.From the very beginning of the Tyranid invasion, you can see Kim playing and who we control.Our elite brothers from the Ultramarine Legion against ordinary soldiers look like real titans.They are not only distinguished by their armor every size of our characters, real giants equal to Tyranid warriors.The strength with which we fight, a sense of hand and shooting weapons has been devoted perfectly especially if you play on a dedicated pad (I use xbox).Every blow, every shot or headshot is felt and gives not little satisfaction.Bloody finishes are the proverbial dot above i.



The first pleasant surprise is to add cooperation in the game.In addition to the first mission, the prologue introducing the next missions can be played together with one or two friends.It works great and even conquers emotions from playing together.Fortunately, if we play and our comrades themselves, it works great.



This is the proverbial dessert.If someone remembers the previous Space Marine and the multiplayer model contained in the game, it will smile slightly to this day.He was great and gave me many hours of great entertainment.13 years have passed and we got what we all waited for.For MP itself, it is worth buying Space Marine 2.

Wuffy,0,74.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013445641/,"As it stands now I can't recommend this game at this point. I paid for the gold version, so I'm 90 bucks deep into this game. I paid a premium for it.

On the technical side of things I don't have much to say. I've got a beast of a PC and it ran well. Never had a hickup. I did have many bugs however where my camera would bug out during a finisher or be thrown across the map while doing a finisher.

I had high hopes for this, being a massive 40K fan. Especially since I would get to play a Space Marine. Or so I thought. More on that later.

Campaign:
It is alright. Not much to say on it. It is so short it is barely worth mentioning. The story is cool, I think. You get to see a couple of different factions and a pretty big ending. The power scaling in the campaign makes you feel like a space marine. Barely.

I doubt that anyone who isn't into 40k would get as much as I did out of the campaign given teh lack of ""Oh I know that!"" moments which was around 40% of the fun. Can't fault them for the accuracy, it feels pretty authentic.

Haven't played it and I suspect that not many will.

Here is where the issues lie. Given that the campaign is over if you blink too fast you'll find yourself either playing operations or PVP. With these operations you have 6 missions. Bland, uninspired. Any misconception of you playing a space marine will vanish at this point. Basic ennemies (Minoris ennemies) will delete your health faster than a guardsman falling during a Krieg assault. You feel about as durable as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient. You deal about as much damage as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient too. Oh and don't worry, you can increase your damage output from 1 to 1.2 if you reach level 25. So you can look forward to upgrading your damage to that of an overzealous toddler if you can manage to stick it out for that long.

Weapon variety is non-existent. You get maybe 4 weapons per class? A bit more if you play the tactical. Forget about playing any kind of melee class as well. You'll find yourself stunlocked. Yes, stun locked... in a horde shooter and slasher game. You missed that weird parry window? Well too bad you're dead now. Good you had that expensive Space Marine armor on right? Otherwise, you'd be dea-... oh right. Oh and don't forget that for many classes you don't even get a rifle or a melee weapon.

Sadly you are very sloooow in this game. Attacks take a financial quarter to complete only to provide diminishing returns. You have all the bad aspects of being heavily armored while not being tanky at all. Usually, games will make you slow and heavy in order to being able to take a lot of damage, and quick and nimble but able to take less damage. Not in this game. You'll take massive amounts of damage from a small critter of which there are around 30 around you at any given time aaaand be slow and deal no damage. Remember from the lore when they said ""Nothing that big should be that fast""? Yeah, must have been something the devs missed or something.

I feel like I do have to talk about this... I've seen a lot of ""skill issue"" comments brought to people who don't like the clunky combat and broken parry system. I have finished all from software games with the exception of sekiro and elden ring. So the choice is all follows: Either Space Marine 2 is harder than Bloodborne, Darksouls 1 to 3 and demon souls, or there might be something wrong with the gameplay.

I'd say buy this when it is on sale or maybe just buy another game. I hear good things about Black Myth Wukong. Strangely enough in Darktide you feel more powerful than in this game. Despite playing a prisoner under the orders of an inquisitor and not a superhuman angel of death.

This game had all my bias stacked in its favor, yet I still can’t recommend it. I played it for 20 hours, thinking that at some point the fun must start. Around any corner now. But it never came. I never felt like a space marine. And if I could refund it I would. But I’ve been punished for being optimistic. If you buy this game, expect nothing and then maybe it will surprise you by mistake.

I may revisit it if the devs rework many of the systems but we all know that it isn't going to happen;",2024/9/10,en

- Learn to parry and evade, and become immortal as dreadnought.
- It is advisable to use the police in the ""reflection"" and points 1.2 for you will seem ordinary.
- Get rid of the AUE weapon in a new complexity, because you kill your brothers more than heretics. (Someday they will add it)

Another offer of gaming mods is the PVE mission and PVP, both fun.PVE Solo Operations can be almost difficult, but unlocking various class marines and weapons with perky is a solid fun for hours.

Optimization of the game is very good, I have not noticed any jam, crash or dropy FPS at all.But it wants a solid SSD for quick loading, you should definitely have it.So nothing that would surprise me at the pre-order, but I praise the state of the game immediately after the release.Was my eyebrows lifted me that the support of wide -angle monitors will bring up to one of the later patches?Prooč?

Someone may also stop that the game will start installing Epic Online Services without any questions - I personally is absolutely ♥♥♥ - I just mention.It is not a connection of EPIC and Steam account, this may or may not be done directly in the game menu.It is therefore strictly a cross-play function, ie.To connect you to remote servers.Unfortunately, here the X -readers probably did not understand and wrote hejt, as sorry - this is absurd.Your complete is not a safe and the Internet is not anonymous.

[R.m.K] Gandi,1,54.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/asteg232/,"As a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe, I was immediately tied up by Space Marine 2.The game brings with everything I love about this dark and brutal universe: great graphics, liquid performance and a gripping atmosphere that allows me to dive into the battles of the 41st millennium.

Graphics - an impressive journey into chaos

The graphic is simply breathtaking.From the detailed armor of the Space Marines to the almost endless hordes of the tyranids - each model is a visual highlight.The environments are dark and epic at the same time, just as you can expect from Warhammer 40k.I found it particularly impressive how the explosions and fights were visually captured.Every goal has force, every explosion makes the screen tremble, and the battlefields quickly turn into ruins.It is like standing in the middle of a battle.

Performance - liquid, even if it becomes hectic

Even with the biggest battles, the performance remains stable.I had no break -ins in the frame rate, even if dozens of tyranids raged on the screen.The game runs remarkably smoothly and shows how well optimized it is.It is particularly impressive how things go stable even on medium systems without losing visual quality.

Game feeling - intensive and brutal

What I particularly liked is the feeling of actually being a space marine.Space Marine 2 manages to perfectly convey the force and strength of an ultramarine.Every melee attack feels massive and the Bolter shots have a satisfactory sound.You have the feeling that you are unstoppable through the enemies - and that's exactly how it should be!The control is intuitive and fluid, so it is fun to rage through the opposing hordes.

Atmosphere - which brought 41st millennium to life

Space Marine 2 perfectly captures the dark atmosphere of the Warhammer 40K universe.The brutality, hopelessness and the constant threat of the tyranids can be felt at every moment.The soundtrack and the noise effects contribute to immersion - from thundering explosions to the terrifying roaring of the enemies.You really feel like you are fighting for human survival.

Conclusion-a must for 40k fans

The plot is still a simple design of all enemies
In terms of enemy types:
At present, the types of enemies are visible to the naked eye. It is designed in the 8th to nine editions. If you want to see the moving Nona, you may have to wait to update.
There are knives and worms, warriors, guns, brainworms, snakes, big brainworms, dumplings, Licats, stone ghosts, spores and tyrants
Qianzi has red -letter warrior, wizard, church, rebellion, pointed beast, and Terminator of the Holy Beast.
However, in normal play, the worm units that players can face will lack tyrants. In almost the whole process, they are knifeworms, gunworms, samurai, guns and samurai
The stone statue ghost will only encounter in a few levels
And the tyrant is not in the normal game, he put it in many people PVE
The game of this game is outrageous. If you have played a black myth, the mouse inside is also happy, and this gunworm will really break you.
In terms of level design:
I personally think that the design of teaching is very shit, the difficulty is high and long ...
If you want to play monsters with friends, it is recommended that you first pass the PVE task yourself, otherwise you can't unlock the PVE task directly.
The level design is not very clever, and the fluency is lacking (compared to the generation), the design of the entire map is a line, and then walk to the end, the switch, continue to go, and then open the switch.Why do you have to design this.
Aspect
The performance is very hammer. You can see the movement of Chimera, the movement of Ramand, the motioned bug, and the execution.

#NAME?,1,466.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056606996/,"The game is Warhammer 40K through and through. Grim, Dark and gritty.

The story is good and introduces you to why Titus got turned into a Primaris well.
For the obvious culture war question: No, it is not ""woke"".

Combat is violent and satisfying. A similar experience to what I recently had with Batman Arkham Knight. It is challenging.
(Countering, dodging and learning patterns etc, but it is more simplified here).
When you play as Titus you FEEL like a Space Marine. The power of the melee attacks, ripping enemies limb from limb. The shaking footsteps where you can 'feel' the weight behind every step. The thunderous boom as so much armour, meat, bone and muscle hits the ground after jumping down a ledge.

Started the game on hardest difficulty, and it is very challenging. Still determining if it will be possible to finish playing solo with bots. Edit: Seems possible, but is very challenging. Would only suggest ""Angel of death"" difficulty for the most dedicated players.

Shooting is also satisfying, but can't be completely relied on, engaging in melee is nearly mandatory once swarms close in.

Visuals are very impressive and faithfully 40K.

Sounds are all great and when involved in fighting give you the feeling you are in a battle.
Music is dark and 100% fits 40K theme. The main theme when the game starts actually sent chills down my back. (Awe inspiring).

After a quick look, operations and Endless War mode will provide plenty of replay opportunity.
Edit: Operations is thoroughly enjoyable. Levelling up is fun and very satisfying to become more powerful with more perks, better weapons and the armour skins are beautiful. The artists REALLY put effort into them!

On technical and performance, the game is running beautifully. RTX 3060, I7-10700K, 32GB RAM, SSD, Windows 11. Ultra settings, native resolution @ 1080P with TAA gives 40-60 frames. Lowest frames I've experienced so far are 30 in graphically intensive portions. (Considering my hardware is not high end, the performance was surprising to me, it shows the game is well optimised in my opinion).

The game practically oozes all the effort and work the developers put into the game and definitely worth any 40K fan's attention.

Some are saying it has Epic. The game makes use of Epic online services. (Not an app, just core components that allow crossplay between Steam and Epic as well as the needed files for Easy Anti Cheat. No Epic account was required when I started the game and none created that I am aware of).

A couple of technical issues I can't figure out, sometimes voice lines are normal, then barely audible (with subtitles it isn't too much of a problem, but if playing without them you strain to hear them.)

The most glaring problem is that the so called anti-cheat is doing nothing to keep cheaters out from ruining the game for others. That alone is enough to spoil the entire experience in PVE and PVP.

Couldn't join a friend in campaign and still looking for a solution. (Will update review if I find one or find the cause). Edit: I was able to join friends today with a few retry attempts, but connecting isn't reliable and sometimes doesn't work. Edit #2: Connection much better. Regularly join with friends now and only disconnections now and then.

Edit: No crashes or glitches thus far with exception that sometimes a save seems to glitch out and you restart a checkpoint with lower ammo, different primary than the one you chose along the mission, meds and health than you had when you reached the checkpoint. (This happened to me on ""Severance"" mission when mobbing me. Unknown what exactly happens to cause the glitch.",2024/9/7,en

MrMarionette14,0,29.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMarionette14/,"There are big problems in combat design.None of the simplest values ​​to the lowest bottom combat interaction.The production team wants to combine melee remote and other combat methods, but the result is all pulling.
Most of the battles in the game are given a large space and then brushed a large number of enemies with a large amount of reunification, but the performance of the player's role is not enough to clear the melee enemies or in turn.Compared with the high -pressure worm nest or chaos, players' weakness of solution is not worth mentioning, and the empty venue design and powerlessness of remote attacks even make the player unable to do it. Slowness is dead.
The reverse feel is very strange. According to the prompt button, it may not be able to play perfectly. The overall judgment highlights a mystery, and the humorous gun is decided to control itself for a second.At the same time, defense or dodge cannot interrupt the current attack action in the battle, and I don't know if it is BUG or what.And even so, elite enemies often appear to cooperate with attacks, and the hard straight after the rebound was attacked by other elite monsters.
In addition, the hard -straight mechanism is also very disgusting. If the attacking is hard, it will cause it to be suppressed when facing multiple enemies or specific joint moves.
The poor supply in the level is poor. I do n’t know if it is difficult for the action mode to be able to pick up 4 medical packages from beginning to end: this is almost the need for a character's blood volume.
The enemy's attack method is also very against the sky. Most of the long -range elites can hardly attack the attack to change the blood, especially the brainworm is the most outrageous.As a BUFF, an enemy with a large range of remote attacks and flying one has a thick outrageous blood volume, which is pure against the sky.Get priority. If there are too many blood, it will not be dropped. Finally, it will be processed. It will BUFF other enemies, and will use high -frequency attacks to force players to dodge.
In addition to judging mystery, BOSS is relatively small. In addition to the enhanced brainworm BOSS on the main line, most of the AOE is too much other than the sky.
The summary is that the battery life and control methods of players are very weaker than the 1st generation, but the enemy has increased a lot in both the number and strength.The enemies in the face surpassed the player's performance battle experience.
Although I think the dark tide is also a spam game, I think Saber should go to play 500 hours of dark tide and redesign this game.
See how the dark tide is done:
In a complex environment, players have bunkers and corners to rely on and let the enemy gather in the same place.Melee enemies will block the gun line of the remote enemy.Players have a strong skill to solve the field, and have a sliding shovel to avoid long -range attacks.
There are fixed medical stations in the level, fixed number of medical boxes and supply boxes, as well as randomly distributed medical needles and ammunition.Regardless of enough, at least not so digging.
The enemy design may be the best place for dark tide. Although it has appeared because of the value, the overall performance is in a reasonable range due to the value of the sky or a machine gunner.
The dark tide BOSS is relatively not too colorful, but it is still not inferior to Star Warrior 2. At least there is nothing to rely on invincible frames to hide from the sky full -screen AOE.
Considering that the dark tide is not the first to make, my evaluation is the future.At present, no one is recommended (unless you really like the IP 40K IP and have good tolerance for the garbage system) before the production team is greatly modified.",2024/9/8,zh-cn
Mammothmk2,0,19.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mammothmk2/,"The battle has been connected and the cooperation is playing. The advantages of this game are lacking, but there are a few more serious problems. We will say:
advantage:
1. Hammer is looking forward to the current product of the present, if you are a Hammer, most of the elements in it can be known, and there are no games that can be so restored at present.
2. It is indeed the production team of the Zombie World War. There is really a set of ways to perform enemy clusters.
3. Fighting performance, the performance of the ending skills is very good, and the feedback of the strike is very cool.
shortcoming:
1. The game encourages melee. After all, the melee is returned to the shield, and the end technique is invincible, but the feedback reward is too bad, and the return of the shield is a little bit. The difficulty in the early stage is okay.When you play down, the game also lacks effective AOE methods. In addition to the flying sledgehammer, grenades, and skills, once surrounded, it is basically sent.What, do you say that the bomb is reversed and fighting?Which blue and red circle full of screens, which one do you fight?Not to mention that there are CDs, you also need to be aimed at the enemy, and the enemy with a long -distance black gun needs to be aimed at.Rolling people are very common.
2. Weapon problem, to be honest, the weapon of this game is so few beyond pointing, don't get me wrong, I am talking about the weapon that can be used, a dazzling shotgun, but in fact it is the balance of the value of the value of the magazine, the rate of fire rate,Therefore, basically it is a pile of fire speed, magazine, and uneven range of shotguns, which are essentially nourishing guns, low and funny.Not to mention that you are a Astert, the recoil and aiming are so outrageous, and the scatter is the same as the shotgun.The useful weapons are hot -melt, plasma, and snails such as killing large weapons.I can't see that there are few ammunition supplies, and they are still scattered, and the character treatment methods are scarce. The broken grenades of the main AOE weapon can only bring 3 eyes.The arsenal of cloak cockroaches is much richer than you Astert.
3. Level design and task. If you have played the zombie world war, you will find that this is essentially the mission template of the zombie world war.It is not necessary to describe it. It is essentially the set of brushes, skill trees, weapons unlocking, etc. of the zombie world war.The growth rewards are also bad. Basically, only in the later period can I experience the refreshing sense of the emperor's possession.The duplication is serious, resulting in lack of good content and tasteless.The world view of 40K is very large. I just hope that the production team can launch new content in time in the future. The current content is completely worth 200+.
4. The game does not talk about the content. First of all, as a 24 -year game, it does not support HDR, and does not support wide screens. This is incredible.It shouldn't.As for the Internet, this kind of PVE PVP game is always talked about. It is not surprising that teammates ghost animals are not surprised. I do n’t have too much evaluation here.As for the small blue bear anti -cheating?In addition to the disgusting players themselves, this stuff is the same as the anti -cheating aspect. As soon as the PVP result of the PVP was opened, the invincible shields were entered.
All in all, unless you are a loyal hammer, I suggest 200+ or ​​don't spend it. The Mid -Autumn Festival is approaching. Personally, I still recommend that you buy a moon cake gift box to honor your friends to condolence.",2024/9/8,zh-cn

The world view of 40K in war hammers makes me feel like I bought a DLC 399.There are many people's tasks to play, but six pictures can't be played.It can only be said that the future is available.
Here are some of my personal opinions. Although I feel that this game is developed like a semi -finished product, but the potential of this platform is still there.The 40K world is so large in size. This tank armored vehicle endowner is fearless of various models and Titan. Are the game content waiting for you to develop the skin of each battle group.I see that there are also suggestions for a multi -person battlefield mode to cast these contents into the online player.The battlefield mode game balance will be done well and there will be a group of long -term players.So many races in the war hammer world are enough to develop to the old sea of ​​the sky.I believe that in addition to loyal players and chaos, there is a large number of players who want to experience the magical battle with the second brother of Mao to experience the magic battle of Mao Mao!Imagine that Lakart killed as invisible to cut SM as the samurai as a samurai, like cutting melon and cutting vegetables, and eating hungry.If you want to follow the intentions of the upper and more good ways to conquer the universe, or find that the home is taught by the family to be taught by the machine, you must know that the hammer friends have not only players who are loyal to various race forces.You can also develop a single -headed mode or the battle flag mode, etc.
Passers -by players who are not hammers still recommend that they are discounted when they are squatting.

That the Advantages and Disadvantages of the Game You Made Are Basically The Same ASThose of World War of Zombies, with too little content.

Michelle,1,23,https://steamcommunity.com/id/coastalmichelle/,"Product received for free

I've already gotten to play a quite a bit as I received early review access for my podcast, so I can confidently say this game is worth the time of any Warhammer fan. Saber did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of 40k - the setting, story, sound design, and overall atmosphere are all very well done with an emphasis on attention to detail. Plus they simply nailed both the look and the intensity of ""the swarm"" (much better than Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Helldivers, or even Doom).

Likewise, the combat never gets boring, as you chain endless combos of guns and melee into satisfying executions. The campaign is solid and can be played solo or co-op. The operations mode (which plays a bit more like Vermintide or Darktide missions) has endless ways to customize your character - both with gameplay perks and weapon upgrades, but also a nice cosmetic progression system. There are also class trials to hone your skills and try out the various flavor of marine that best suits your tastes.

I'm looking forward to checking out Eternal War (the PvP mode) now that the game has launched to the general public. All in all it's just a fun game you should get together with the boys and play (or just ride a bunch of cool elevators together, there are a lot in this game).

Note: The 21:9 support wasn't in when I tried it yet, so hoping that comes in the Day 1 patch, as well as a fov slider.

But as a solo player going through the campaign on the recommended (albeit second hardest) difficulty, this game feels absolutely terrible to play. You have the two worst AI squad mates I have ever had the displeasure to call battle brothers, with the most useless and unforgiving ""armor"" system imaginable. Is it playable? Absolutely. Is it gratifying in difficulty to carry the bots through every mission while they exist only to throw some mostly ineffective bullets around and revive you (which will occur often)? No.

I do not even feel good getting better at the game sometimes, because it feels like I am competing against the actual combat system more than the enemies. So much of this game is made to be a flowing combat experience of dodging, slashing, and parrying, but often it just isn't. You get stuck in animations. You get notifiers of enemy attacks only like 1/3rd of the time. You get rewarded for parrying and playing it slow, but that just isn't effective when you're also getting swarmed by mooks that CHEW through you if you aren't constantly swinging, which paired with the aforementioned stuck in animations makes you take SO much unnecessary damage. Damage you barely heal from without wasting your ultimate with a lengthy cooldown, or frivolously utilizing the very scant med packs.

Rant aside, the game is genuinely good when it's good and when playing with actual people it's even better. Which is lucky considering the PvE and PvP are the main long term focus of the game. But as a solo player just enjoying the story at present, it is one of the worst experiences I have had playing a campaign.",2024/9/6,en
Carbonara?,1,41.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014942266/,"Finally a game that is stable at launch, with content and without particular bugs that ruin its experience.I recently finished the campaign, perfectly in Warhammer style, without very particular twists and very linear but enjoyable immediately.Simple but finished gameplay that from satisfaction.The PVP mode is the same, simple but that it manages to involve, it is not too demanding but if you have a team, you can take away satisfactions on a tactical level.Graphically very beautiful and I must say, also optimized well.GPU and CPU do not go boiling, everything turns well.I repeat, it wasn't a game of day one without problems without problems, a finished product.Not the usual exit that proves to be a half casino between server and optimization and then discovering that there are no pieces, you have to wait for DLC and anything else.I highly recommend it.

Sore note:

The campaign has no matchmaking unfortunately therefore either you have a friend (who advises you absolutely, it is much more fun) or you will have to entrust yourself to the bots who unfortunately are everything except intelligent and in some moments, there is really to blaze because notThey manage to give priority to dangerous enemies and unfortunately you will happen to die very badly even a bit because of them.

Mini Tip for the campaign and for the operation (PVE):

Around the map, you will find green speakers with the icon of a sword or something, well: destroy them, because inside you will find strokes, stimulating and sometimes even temporary upgrades to the armor.It looks like a bullshit but when I casually discovered it, it was a nice saved at high levels with the bots;especially for stimulants.

Really Bad: playing solo campaign on veteran and can barely get through any set pieces without dying 100 times and is not skill issue. They did not play their own game to see that combat, while looking great, is derpy af

Will talk about it on core, i hope they see this or hear it, I really like this game but the combat makes it hard to love. will edit review and switch to thumbs up once combat is fixed but I'm super tilted by the sloppy combat in this game.

1) getting pummeled at range while having no cover sucks and we’re no dodge ninjas. Range damage should be hella lowered. I'm busy dealing with the problem in CQC. if they wanna pepper me while i'm in there -- fine. If they improve the health return mechanic maybe its less of an issue, but its just not fun getting peppered relentlessly while I'm in a scrum. I realize it maybe more realistic, but is video game who cares.

2) parry need to cancel current action and take priority over all other moves (except executes aka glory kills), and it needs to be generous with direction and timing. We have hoards of dudes crawling into our butts. It may not be realistic but it feels good video game wise — doom 2016 and eternal does this super well with glory kills. Doesn’t matter if I’m reloading or scratching my nuts I press glory kill and I glory kill. Executes already does this in game, parries should do this as well

3) I find myself parrying even if there is no blue circle. Let parries just work — like Arkham games. the number of times a sword guy does an non-blue non-red attack and I parry only for the game to derp and I get hit anyway is massively aggravating. I could have been spamming attack, but when I spam attack, there's a blue circle and I'm in an attack anim and can't parry. This isn't some fighting game where misreads are punished. Let the players parry. The animations looks sick for it I want to spam the parry-gun shot follow up all freakin day man.

4) The game only lets you self heal on glory kill when you have white health. White health lasts like 0.000001 seconds. Get rid of white health, it's dumb. All executes should just self heal. This will let us tank the range damage we're getting pummelled by when we are in a melee scrum. Medkits can then and should be saved for ranged encounters (where executes aren't available).

5) Armor is weird and makes little sense. Make it one bar or just get rid of it. I don't remember needing it in SM1 and I'm not even sure what is does except go away quickly and never come back.

6) mission set pieces seem to be designed for 3 players… a) set piece mechanic b) hordes of melee c) ranged minions. In solo, I can’t use 3 different weapons at the same time. Example is the rat fight -- I can't shoot the flame thrower, the ranged drones, and the damn sword guys all at the same time. The moment I swap to plasma gun/sword the rat turbines trip me on to the ground and do 1000000 damage. like did you need play these missions solo and go ""man sure seems like some cheap ♥♥♥♥ players will love this""

7) exacerbating this problem is the number of times I see ai teammates just standing there, or take a few pot shots at a baby tyrannid while a set piece mission objective is going up in smoke made me put down the game. Again, during rat missions there are drones that need to be taken out, and rats to keep at bay. Since the AI can't be bothered to use the flamethrower, I gotta keep rats at bay. What are my AI buddies doing? Shooting rats. Either make them be more effective at helping or make the set piece stuff make sense for solo play.

I actually love a lot about this game and want to play it more but combat and poor combat encounter design leaves too much to be desired right now and the game is frustrating.",2024/9/7,en

XaMaX †,1,15.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaksPlayGamesYT/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is an action game created by the Saber Interactive studio.
In the game, we control the captain Titus member of the Ultramarines order who was also the main character in Space Marine 1.
In Space Marine, we play 200 years after the events of the first part.
The combat system is well done, during the war with monsters we will use pistols, rifles and chain swords or knives.
Weapons have little ammunition, so during the fight we change dynamically as we fight, sometimes we fight from a distance and 5 seconds later we cut our enemies with a sword.
The game has 3 modes: campaign, operations and eternal war.
In the campaign we can play solo or in co-op with two friends, the same is the case in the operations we can play them alone or in co-op.
The mode is a PVP mode in which we have 3 types of matches: takeover of the area, takeover and control and annihilation.
During the online game we have 6 different character classes to choose from which differ in weapons they fight and special skills.
Classes to choose from that, that is, everyone will find something for themselves from the fight at the sniper distance to the fight in close the mainstay.
What I also have to praise in this game is graphic design and landscapes, everything is beautifully done and gives us this feeding of the world of Warhammer.
What makes me happy is that the version 1.0 of the game is very well refined and we do not have such problems here as with many other new games.
As for me, the game is great, I will certainly play a lot and wait for the next updates because Roadmap looks great for the next 2 years.

I also invite you to my video in which I show this game:",2024/9/7,pl

[BLOP] Misanthropy-AU,0,125.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006448215/,"Cannot recommend the game in it's current release state.

Pros first off, followed by cons.

1: the game actually runs well at high framerates, optimization isn't a big issue here.

2: Gunplay & TTK are good. Recoil can be felt, guns feel good to use. not some shoddy CoD shooter with 0.2s hipfire spray TTK. The Player's ability to aim well is rewarded here.

3: The game's audio feels meaty, heavy and (relatively) realistic & believable.

4: PvE Melee combat. can't say much about it because i prefer to shoot things, but it works well in PvE. feels like they've combined valheim with dark souls.

5: Customization. Follows pretty closely from space marine 1 but with further improvements. Some of the best of any Warhammer game i've played.

6: Environment. The maps are pretty with effort and work put into them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons.

1: PvE Co-op/Campaign ques are still bugged for me personally, though they work for most people. i am unable to start any PvE or campaign game of my own due to the bug of being left on the battle barge with no UI after a black screen. - The solution proposed by a comment in the review Does work, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still bugged.
(Edit 9/09/2024)

2: PvP Que limitations. can only bring at most two friends into PvP. on the upside you can't guild stack PvP lobbies.

3: PvP Class Balance: i'm just gonna say it. mid at best. at higher levels the JPA's practically worthless. The Bulwark's relegated to using their flag ability and is otherwise worthless. Melee's just plain bad.

4: Lack of content. the main campaign is extremely short taking only a few hours to complete. There are 8 replayable PvE operations which is where the bulk of this game's content is. Shares similarities to killing floor where the only differences are as you get stronger via weapon upgrades, class & weapon perks, you simply up the difficulty instead of doing something new. if you don't care much for that, you could play through all of the game's content within half a day.
on a personal level i preferred the wave survival of the first space marine. less walking, less talking. more shooting.

5: PvE AI Squaddies. while they do have some nice features like leaving executes for the player when the bot doesn't need the armor regeneration, they overall fall short. they're not great at fighting back against the hordes, and most of the time don't cover you when your stuck doing objectives that leave you defenceless.

6: Class selection limitations - Done for balance reasons that i can certainly understand, however there's no support for people that want to play a specific class. No ability to pre-select the class you desire to play prior to queuing, and having MM filtered to suit your selection.

7: Easy Anti-Cheat. it's awful and players have already cracked it. Players running around with infinite grenades & trainer like cheats etc.

8: Lack of Shoulder camera swap for PvP. It's all about right angle peaks.

TL:DR - Overall it's a solid core game. once the release bugs get ironed out and some more content comes out i could definitely recommend this. just not in it's current release state.",2024/9/6,en

Mechanics:

Middle battle:
Fucking another button for the parrying, (I offer) to parry on a time -pressed attack button in close combat as in the first part, I get a pussy from the fact that the parrying cannot block the blow and the other cockroach with a chatter

Far battle:
The rifle bolt and other types of these weapons are felt on the difficulties above light, like flashlights in the imperial guard, although the flashlights are more beneficial, the only acceptable weapon is Melta (I use as a shotgun), a rifle/pistol and then they are slightly better than a rifle boltI play for whom?That's right: Astartes who does not come out due to binge with trembling hands, in the sight and from the thigh the shells fly anywhere but not in the enemy.

- More than, lieutenant

13 years ago, the first part made a rather strong impression on me.The first shooter in the Varhammer universe, which I really liked, where the massiveness of Astartes was felt, where there was a powerful and juicy sound of a shot from a bolter, which I have never heard anywhere else.For a long time, I did not even hope for the second part, and now, after 13 years, hope appeared again.Hear the same bolt sound, feel this massiveness, and again do a pleasant thing - burn heretics, kill mutants, and eliminate the unclean.How did it happen?

Despite the fact that the first part came out for a long time, I would like to compare a little with it including.A very similar introduction, a familiar soundtrack, the narrative itself - in the new part there are many moments that were still in the first, but now they are much more modern.

First of all, I would like to highlight the graphics and locations.Despite the imperial template, the locations do not look empty and are very detailed.Sometimes I want to stop for a while to see some kind of type or battles in the distance, or see and listen to third-party dialogs.The world looks alive, and now it really looks like a planetary scale, and not just a walk along the ruins of the world-worship.

Separately, I really want to highlight the artificial intelligence Tiranid.Almost every tyranid you see has every right to get a bolter shell, it is not just an animated background.The exception here is only flying representatives.And this every tyranid wants to kill you, and it is mutually.At the same time, they act in packs, and if you figured out one of them and switched your attention to some more enemy - most likely, the next flock is already confidently selected from the flank or from the rear.It will take this, each large room becomes a new test for survival, including a new opportunity to destroy as many xenos as possible.I think this is the fervor of the battle, entering it is quite simple, and this is a very delivery process.

With artificial intelligence, partners are a little more complicated.At least yes, they are not for beauty, and in the same way they are trying to deal with the enemy with you, they will raise you when wounded, and they will carry out finishing up in the same way (when there is no one left).Although sometimes there was a feeling that it was not clear where they were, and what they are doing, and whether they kill enemies at all.Unfortunately, they cannot be customized, a specific weapon is given to them, or to give orders, or at least set some basic tactics of actions.Therefore, I got the impression that the campaign is very sharpened under the coop - to play the game with two fighting brothers will probably be much more interesting.

The plot is quite short, passes in about 8 hours.And only I began to think that he began to become a little boring, and it seems like everything is already going on to end, as this very plot began to accelerate, aka gravibike, painted in red.Separate missions sometimes add small individual mechanics, new types of weapons are gradually issued.Basically, these are, of course, bolters who are not very different with each other, but there is an opportunity to try different and choose the most loved for yourself.Several different types of weapons of close combat, different types of grenades (which is also pleasant).I managed to touch PVP a little, now it works a little with difficulty, but it is playing quickly and pleasant.

There is some feeling of a sort of patterned of modern games - the linearity of the corridors, it is parry, to avoid this, periodically clean the barriers.But the most important thing is the quality with which this is done.And in my opinion, it is done very well.And well optimized - on my not the most modern gland is played quite smoothly on high, without flights and without bugs.In our millennium, not every release game can boast of the like.

Given the fact that there is Roadmap, and there will be more new cards, weapons and so on, and the game will develop further - in general, I believe that this is a very, very worthy continuation of the series.Perhaps there are some disadvantages, but I think they are rather insignificant or subjective.I hope that I will still stay in PVP and PVE modes for longer.For the process is very

First talk about advantages
40K environment screen performed the best game
Various outdoor scenes are definitely not comparable to the dark indoor perception of dark tide
The background board head and Tyron are shot, plus the Zombie World War and the same insects and seaworm walls, to optimize or even be good in the case of ensuring so many units.
Hammer pink light can directly pay the ticket money with a few big scenarios
There is also a dialog on the warship. The NPC dialogue before each level is different
When I saw you coming over and kneeling in a row, I was still excited to chat after the battle
Still a game that can be worth the fare from the details and screens
————————
After talking about the advantages, start talking about the shortcomings (this time I only talk about the gaming experience, and set the enemy's intensity)
The most important problem, the performance of the character is too weak
The overall character performance is not even as good as the dark tide. The three original cans of Diaomin Qihai Swimming SM2 are surrounded by mobs to sweat back.
There are also dark tide and the same annoying mob+sniper monsters to interfere with your melee to take over the enemy
Melee attack, shooting guns, dodge, blocking all of the blocks that can be unliked. It seems to wear a canned food. The actual toughness is extremely low.Half blood, a mob+a medium -sized monster can blew you in the corner to insult and death
Your valuable two/three -frame shields only use a certain use when resisting remote shooting. The most basic soldiers will break the one -grid shield.There will be two sniper fancy cranes behind the two sniper, and the hard -straight really hard -working knife will even be cut back to interrupt a constipation.
(In the multi -person mode, because of the strong binding of fighting and execution, it will even be executed, so that the canned food that is originally paste is even more paste)
When a large number of enemy mobs are receiving the enemy mobs, you will even sweat the best way or even avoid melee to fight more remote

The power of all the weapons of bombs and weapons is very problematic (and whether the Star Warrior can't hold the gun or not)
Compared with the strike effect of shotguns in the dark tide, the explosive shotgun in your hand is simply a water shotgun.

Based on the retro abstract single -key bit design: (Left -click shooting and right -click the melee open -mirror opening wheel switch mode/magnifying multiplier C key)
There is also a problem with the liver degree of PVE outside the bureau,
The full level of the weapon requires a minimum difficulty of more than 80 games. When you understand the key nodes of the lock, you need to use key items to unlock it. The overflow experience before unlocking is directly overflowing.
Combined with this PVE key item, I do n’t know if it is a random refresh and a random position. You need to lick the map like a white book (currently you have lick only 2 key props)

The multiplayer mode cannot be repeated, but the switching occupation requires a 50 -meter walk to find the Martian guy to switch the occupation/modification installation.
It seems that the PERK choice of the three -choice one is not opened to you at the same time. For exampleAnd after unlocking, you need to spend money on the game in the game
Unlocking weapons also requires the purchase of currencies in the game, and you need to spend money to buy by unlocking painting (I bought DLC, do you want me to buy it again in the game?)
And it seems that this currency can only be upgraded to get
Summarize
If you are a hammer powder, you can pay the fare by the picture

That's all


The picture is beautiful and carefully seen that the character's rough face, the red helmet on the face, all day is not paralyzed, but the overall is qualified.

Effect sound gun sound is monotonous and unqualified

Shooting melee strike is not enough
I am all interstellar warriors. I shot a shot of a shot and hit the weakest bug. You do n’t give me the effect. If you are not threatened by the bug, you will pile more little mobs to shoot me. Elastic
However, the guns are executed and the dodge is done well

Single battle plot level design is qualified
There are counts, such as the bridge section of devouring insects is impressive
And changed the company's production to pay tribute to the bridge section of the previous work (I was excavated when I left everyone)

However, there are still a lot of pain points below the disadvantage of the cooperation mode containing End Game

The following starts to vomit

The hardness of the medium -sized elite enemy is unreasonable and almost hit the entire magazine bullet to kill a ordinary elite monster
However, sometimes it is time for a monster to be born. Sometimes it is possible to produce 7-8 elites at a time and then cross the entire formation and slaughter the entire team.
If you want to be slaughtered, you have to take the supermodel hot -melt gun to fight

And you let me play an elite, you have to use a magazine, you give me enough ammunition?! !?!!!

The increase in each level of the shot of the cooperation mode cannot be pursued by the monster unless you get a new gun to abuse the dishes to abuse the dishes.
The effect of the character's specialty tree is not obvious, please learn from the black tide, okay ??

There are a lot of unreasonable little knives for weapon specialties to kill 10 enemies before how to kill ??!!!!

The above bounds are all uncomfortable points at all
I doubt whether the producer has played his own game

The following is the design vomiting

The level route is exactly a single consecutive point of exploration (of course, the producer did not do anything to collect ...)
And there are only 6 pictures to be sincere ??? Do you look at the remnant2? !!? !???????????????????

If you make this cooperation model, a bunch of collection of collectors may wish to get some equipment for us ..........

And why do you only give 3 people a team? !?! Do you know how many people in the Astart Sage instructions? !?!?!!
Anyway, give 4 together !!!!!

A Must-BUY for Warhammer40K Fans Recently

That's all


The picture is pretty good. If you look closly, you can see that the charter's face is rough. ll it's passable.

Effect sound: Monotonous sound of gunfire, unqualify

Shooting, Close Combat, Not EnoGH IMPACT
I'm a ASTARTES. I Hold a Bolter in my hand and shoot away the weakest insect with one shot. Isn't it reasonable that you gu't me such an efficiency? he insect is not a threat enough, just add more more moss and shoot them for me. ...
But I did a good job in executing, Parrying, Dodging, ETC.

The Single-Player Campaign, Plot, and Level Design are all considerd passable.
Several Levels, Such as the Scene with the SWARM of Swallowing Insects, Are Impressive.
Moreover, after Changing the Production Company, there are still some parts that pay tribute to the previous SpaceMarine1 (Leaving It for Everyone when Y)

However, there are many Pain points. The follow shoulders are included in the cooperation mode of end game.

Start vomiting next

The Hardness of Medium-Sized Elite ENEMIES is Unrensonable. It takes almost an Entire Magazine of Bullets to Kill An Ordinary Elite Monster.

However, when arranging the space of monterse, sometimes 7-8 elites can app only, rushing across the entire formation and killing the entire team in anstant. Moreover, The TTK SpecialTies of Ordining Elites Cannit Be Cleared Quickly.

If you do, I have to her with me with a supermodel's melta gun.

And you asked me to use one magazine to shoot an elite, but you gave me insufficient ammunition?!?!?! The bolter has 210 rounds of ammunition?!?!?!?!

The Guns Obtaine in the Coopative Mode Cannot Keep Up With the Improvement of Monsters at Each Level. Vel, Otherwise, there will be no happy feedback from upgrading when you get a new gun and reach a new level.
The effect of the character specialization tree is not obvious. Can you please lead, 40k: darktide ??

There are many unrensonable skills in the weapon specialization tree. The knife neededs to kill 10 enemies in a row before it can be attached. How to kill ??!!!!!!!

All of the above are functionally unsatisFying points.
It makes people wonder if the product have event their own games.

The followIn is a complaint about the design

The level route is completely single and there is even the slightest bit of explicy the product, has
And there are only 6 map to play. Where is your sincericerity ??? LOOK at remnant2 next to it? !!?!? !????????????????????????

If you do this cooperative mode and have a bunch of apparant colleges, you might as well get something for us to grind ...

This latest installment in the Warhammer 40K universe sets a new standard for action-packed shooters with its impeccable blend of brutal melee combat, strategic gunplay, and stunning visuals.

From the moment you step into the power armor of a Space Marine, the game impresses with its attention to detail. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking, showcasing the grimdark universe with a level of realism that immerses you completely. The environments are richly detailed, from the war-torn landscapes to the imposing architecture of the Imperium’s strongholds.

The combat is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The gameplay feels both fluid and weighty, with a seamless transition between hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry. The new abilities and upgrades add depth and variety, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and exhilarating. The game’s AI is notably sharp, presenting a formidable challenge that keeps you on your toes without ever feeling unfair.

Narratively, the game excels in delivering a compelling story set against the backdrop of a galaxy in turmoil. The voice acting and script are top-notch, with a storyline that feels both epic and personal. The character development is rich, and the dialogue manages to balance gravitas with moments of dark humor, adding layers to the experience.

Multiplayer has also received a significant upgrade, offering diverse modes and a robust progression system that keeps the action engaging and competitive. Whether you’re battling in co-op missions or competing in PvP, the multiplayer experience is both rewarding and addictive.

In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a masterclass in combining thrilling gameplay with a deep, immersive world. It’s a must-play for fans of the franchise and a standout entry for those new to the universe. This game not only meets but exceeds expectations, proving itself as a benchmark in the genre.

Fixxer,0,23.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordhighfixxer/,"Problems With the Progression System
The current progression system in an otherwise great game is a turn-off and is going to drive would be players away from sticking with the game as it evolves over the course of its road map

Separate Cosmetic and Class Progression
Having a single currency, Requisitions, be required to progress these categories puts players in a position where they are going to make mistakes as they try to kit out their preferred Astartes Chapter. Players will be in search of the correct right shoulder insignia or company pauldron trim paint and this means sacrificing progression of class skills. There is no explanation of this risk to a new player and the system itself is so frustrating its easy to have level 15 in a class and not be able to afford even the first row of its perks.





The weapon system is convoluted and tying better weapons behind higher difficulty is a guaranteed way to drive players away out of frustration. The Minimal difficulty in this game is hard and recommending ""Level 5"" to players to take on the next difficulty tier is meaningless if they have spent their Requisitions on cosmetics instead of their class skills.





This game is going to draw a lot of attention when it fully launches. People will be excited about playing as a Space Marine. Even with the above suggested changes the game is going to be a GRIND to progress. When players find out their progress is also heavily skill gated in what is a seriously difficult game they will move on to the next thing. Its important to preserve the high difficulty for players who have the skill and want that challenge. its equally important that the perks and equipment necessary to play on higher difficulties become available to players of lower skill and that the systems involved here be retooled quickly or this game will end up with a very small player base of nothing but hardcore difficulty seekers. The entire backbone of what is otherwise a great game, its progression systems, are a total miss and I hope you take the above as constructive criticism to improve the game and sustain your audience while you still have the opportunity to do so.

I cannot recommend this game until the progression system and economy for multiplayer are addressed, not at the full price asking point.",2024/9/10,en

Feel free to take if you like the universe or high -quality third -person shooters.
I would put 10/10 but I don’t want to hurt maximalism and there’s nothing ideal so I will put 9/10.

The game has an excellent gameplay, a mixer of a third -person shooter with a simple slasher allows you to dominate the battlefield that is filled with opponents on which it is easy to apply the entire arsenal that the game gives you.(The game can be jokingly called ""50 shades of bolts"") The difficulty is quite well-fed, but starting from the veteran, I really advise playing in the coop, even though in the solo I in this complexity and ran in places due to the stupidity of the artificial intelligence of the partners, there are segments where you have to sweat.

Content in the game is a ton, there is a pathos plot company with the ability to pass it in a coop, a separate coopeous company Events whose events take place parallel to the main and the plot of both is weaved.Well, the bond-brow-brown multiplayer, but it will most likely be twisted with new seasons, the same chaosmarins do not particularly pump.

The atmosphere is thick, each frame asks for a screenshot (already 50 screenshots are ready and another billion on the way).The sound is juicy, the bolters bang as it should.In general, art and sound designs are made at the highest level.

Despite some problems at the start of early access, the product itself is extremely well optimized related to non -core and game servers, even on my old woman 2060, the average fps game with Full HD (1080p) resolution.Of course, there are a couple of places where there were serious malfunctions, but these are scenes where literally thousands of teranid are fighting with a guards in real life.

The colleagues who act together are quite excellent and strong, so if you are normal, you will be able to go smoothly if you do not do it.
However, if you rush into the same feeling as the Musou series, it will die relatively easily, so use Parry, avoidance, shooting and proximity properly.
The story is hot full of bromans by strong brother.

Akio Otsuka plays the protagonist and is an action that is relatively easy for everyone to challenge, so I hope that Warhammer will spread in Japan as well.

We are proceeding with multi.
You can play relatively easily up to the difficulty level, but if you go beyond that, you will feel nervous at once.

DaBounz,1,188.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016181539/,"Overpriced console game.

Combat is very cinematic and looks good, but gameplay is actually rather clunky and below average in quality (badly designed and implemented arkham knight mechanics).

Difficulties for the campaign are done the worse way possible : weaken the player character and increase enemy dmg an hp while keeping encounters exactly the same aside from that. This completely ruins the flow, which is already not too great to begin with. Players should always select normal difficulty if solo, especially since AI is an insult to intelligence and increase the frustration of the bad flow even further. Higher difficulties might be fun with a group of competent players (may be).

Campaign is 6-8h long, same for PVE...won't even mention PVP which has clearly been added to the game for reddit whiners who can't handle not having PVP in an RPG (play one game to see how hilariously bad it is though). So you get what...15-20h tops out of the game tops (unless you want to farm the same 6 PVE missions over and over again for skins...but why do that anyways?). For a base price of 60 bucks + 40 bucks season pass that you won't even want to farm, this is the definition of a VERY BAD investment. Check Steam store to see what you can get for a 100 bucks and cry.

Story is cool and fits well in the current 40k storyline developments though.

Money for the emperor !

Update : even though it lacks content, PVE missions (AKA Operations) are quite tasty. The different classes, with their respective gameplays and the progression systems are nice. There have been a bunch of gameplay balancing passes that have been done since release, some are good, some are bad.

What can I say - despite the fact that the game literally with tears in your eyes and blood on bayonets makes you look at tons of kinz, that artists animators did it day and night, not seeing their guys, as well as beautiful fattas, I find that I am ironic that at the timeThe first SMA, many scolded the game for Kinzo, and Dark Souls was felt with something fresh.Now the arrow turned.

Campaign:
A dark -skinned bro and an Indian from the ultramarins tribe join your funny campaign towards adventures in the gloomy 41th millennium.Do not get to the bottom - that chemistry between the characters, that the memes from the first part, that the tone of history, that the kilotons of the pathos, that the bosses - everything looks quite good.Of the minuses: at some point you can tire an incredible amount of the same type of fatalics, but still, the campaign is not so long to get bored completely.
Also, the problem with non -code, brothers and sisters, in this regard, get ready even for bugs in the campaign.

Pve:
Luxurious, adventures for 20 minutes, went and went out, and all this is connected with the main campaign, very diverse in terms of missions and opponents, and generally a healthy thing.BUT!Destroying problems, I remind.

PVP:
It is almost worse than all predecessors: worse than EK, and certainly worse than the first SMA.I do not want to paint a lot, I only mention that the block does nothing but protection against damage.Not repulsive, not a temporary Sian to the enemy, you can be in Klinch the entire match.",2024/9/9,ru

Depression Fortress 2,1,134,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TAKEOFFFLY-ONE/,"This is literally the best that happened to Warhammer 40.000

Preface
The first part of the year of its release (2011) seemed morally obsolete to me: endless gray-yellow corridors, jamming of blannchiks, a trivial plot and chirping men in the main roles.The game was not terrible, it was passing.
In 2020, either from nostalgia, or having plenty of a battles-crafts with open worlds, I wanted to play something most linear and simple and I again installed Space Marine.What was my surprise when all these straightforward corridors and old -fashioned QTE did not cause me a desire to cite from a layer of dust, but on the contrary gave me the same buzz from the idea completely simple and understandable to everyone: run, shoot, overcome!

The moment of weakness is followed by life full of heresies
Clearly realizing the current gaming trend on the half -open Lutogrindyka, which is interesting to watch, but which it was completely not interesting to play, I began to waIn with the release of Space Marine 2. Inside me, it was already accepted that the game could turn out to be another newfangled shit, which are fed from the shovels of playersAnd even at some point, I almost completely lost interest in Space Marine 2, but those pleasant memories of the first part eventually sold me part of the second.And what was my surprise when I discovered that this is still the same polished classic:

- corridor levels in which brutally cheerfully arrange ultranasilia, turning into a minced meat absolutely any creature in its path and not fearing that at some point you will have to call the Ministry of Emergencies to get out of the location
- Simple game mechanics: you shoot at the block = damage;There is damage to the body =;To the head = a lot of damage.And there are no smelly tsifes with the chances of a ricochet, classes of armor and other dull ultrazadr mud for premature impotent
- No pumping in the campaign and clear as a summer day of pumping in a cooperative: more level = immobil more perki
- There is a huge scale to indecent: the game really feels as if you are the little model on the battlefield from the first Dawn of War, which was sent to a suicidal mission in order to unwind the enemy opornik and all whom you will see for delivery
- the breathtakingly beautiful equipment of the space marines, the view of which each time brings you real aesthetic pleasure (in the first part it caused, if not laughter, then at least a smile of its absurdity)
- Cool details of the world, and sometimes even whole scenes working on the atmosphere.What is the only dreadnought from the final chapter, in the pieces of iron of which there is more charisma than in some modern games taken completely

And this whole holiday of life is sprinkled with pleasant graphony with good sound accompaniment.Of course, I would like the space marines once, as they think, spoke in a low volumetric voice with a stylized bang of the transmitters in the style of Flashgitz rollers, but since Peter Gennz, apparently, is the only person with a working microphone in post-sanctioning Russia, similar to usDo not hear another 100 years. No, well, seriously, there are no other actors of the voice acting?I have nothing against the Glaints, but you couldn’t think of anything better there than to take the very last role of a person’s voice, who did not voice the station in the subway?If there is no choice, give Petra finally money or give him a stick, but make him at least at the sound recording studio be captain of the space marines, and not Peter Granets.There are no questions to the voice acting, the rest are nothing more than statists.Well, the suddenly bursting voice of Shrek on Voks in a cooperative added zest.

I can’t call it minuses, because part of the described below is noted in the road map and will be in the future, but I consider it important to pay attention to this:

-very few cards for PVP and all of them completely copy each other without any changes in all modes
- Little unique extraordinary on the weapon, and some skins are literally different only to each other only the height of the location of the cleanliness
- At the moment, they did not bring armor to the chaosites (the cargo barge of the filth is stuck in the warp storms)
- So far only 6 PVE missions
- The search for the PVE lobby could be made more convenient, sometimes it bothers three times over the fact that your Main class is busy

Michael Obama,0,10,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991097170/,"I'm very conflicted about this game. I will continue to play and might change to a positive. But right now these are my thoughts. I have played through the single player on veteran. (which is basically hard difficulty).

Hopefully this helps people if they are struggling to enjoy the game. I know I was in the very first hours. Even now I cannot recommend at the current price even if I am enjoying it more.

In short, Space Marine 2 is effectively Darksiders crossed with Doom: Eternal, without the parts that made either of those games good.

The combat is... not particularly fun? It's very difficult to figure out how the game actually wants you to play it.

For example...

You will take damage. I think this is intended, but initally feels at odds with the fact you are a hulking tank of a space marine. That's werid, but okay I just don't understand the game perhaps.

Anyway, you can't avoid taking damage, so in order to not die, you have to perform executions/context specific moves to get back armour (which is basically health). This is very much like doom eternal where you get enemies into a stun like state and do an execution to get back ammo/health (even has the same flashing red thing around enemies)

But the problem, this play style is full of inconsistency. In Doom Eternal you can attack enemies while reliably know you can get ammo/health/whatever. In Space Marine 2, this is not possible. The gun shot thing might happen or it might not. Parries sometimes work, and feel like sometimes they don't. It can be hard to tell when an enemy will go into an execution state while you are attacking it and so predicting when you are about to get the next armour boon is hard.

This makes a lot of the combat is more random and about chance than anything, and the game is about managing your health in this regard.

So you think, okay, maybe I'm doing it wrong. I'll sit back and used ranged weapons instead of melee.

No.

Guns are piss weak.

As far as I can tell, they are designed to close the distance with enemies and open them up for melee. Some special/heavy weapon are designed to shred mobs, but even then some of those enemies can block all ranged damage lol.

Okay, I'll go back to closing the distance with guns, using melee combos and parrys to get armour and fight through the enemies that way. Maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥ at parrying?

Nah, because some of the early level design has ranged enemies that you can't get to... Those ranged sniper enemies can take upwards of 100 bullets to kill with some weapons. That is almost all of your ammo for one enemy?! How the ♥♥♥♥ does this game want you to play? I still have no idea after 9 hours.

Enemies also need to be taken out in order because other wise you will get utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Once you know this the game is exponentially more enjoyable. But when you don't...

For instance, the ranged dudes, you might think its fine to just keep dodging and killing the little mobs first. No, no, no. If you don't go for the ranged dudes with an almost suicidal vigor you will be absolutely creamed.

You will be dodging. A lot. Pretty much spamming the space bar.

Which brings me onto the controls for PC. They are utterly utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Change these as fast as you can.

I recommend making right click aim (you know like in every game known to man) instead of right click being melee.

Then make middle mouse button parry instead of C. C being parry is utterly deranged.

Then make F melee. Trust me, again, this makes the game exponentially better.

Anyway, it' s very weird game that I am forcing myself to try and like. I do not understand the reviews that say the combat is brilliant. I feel like I'm playing a different game.",2024/9/8,en

On the rest and well for my part on my 3070 no bug apart from 1 crash a single time facing too much opponent.Otherwise really the game is nickel no technical concerns a lot of content.Having to campaign for Unlock Multi -Coop missions is no worse.It really gives us the impression that the Coops missions in parallel hangs over the story.On the other hand, good, how difficult it is!In normal the game is already starting to punish you severely when you miss a counter then in the harder difficulties it must be a real challenge.In all 6 coop missions, 6 hours of campaign I would say ( + if we want to increase the difficulty), a lot of weapons and class to go up in coop/multi PVP, and of course a lot of custom to delight any good sea space.I have not yet tested the PVP but if it is worthy of the 1 no doubt that it will be really incredible.

It’s important to note that this game is not Darktide and it is most definitely not Helldivers. For some reason that’s rhetoric that kept being parroted before release.

The combat itself feels incredible and is insanely fun. I thought it felt clunky at first , but once I understood the mechanics- it clicked. This really does feel like a true return to what gaming was in the 2006-2013 era and what I wish we saw more of today.

A tight , fun campaign and not too long with the ability to play through it in co-op. Co-op exclusive missions. Straight forward PvP with a progression system that unlocks cosmetics by playing the game and weapon skills unlocked by X number of victories.

Chaos definitely got shafted in the customization since all they can do is change colors while Loyalists can mix and match different armor sets. I hope to see them expand on that as the game grows.

It’s had a successful launch, even from early access. Can be played offline, performs well and have barely come across any bugs. As a long time Warhammer fan…this game is everything I’ve ever wanted. Now we just need a Sororitas video game to match…

Tarkus,0,301.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006052891/,"30th of October review update
The game is headed in a direction I don't like. Ruthless difficulty is just not enjoyable anymore. Your space marine gets a lot less armor than in lower difficulties, while enemies just become bullet sponges. Your health pool is gated at the bottom of it, so when you have a lot of it it goes down fast, once you have fewer health bars remaining it goes down slower. It's like most of your health is concentrated in the bottom part of it. Makes no sense.

Enemies do a lot more damage in the higher difficulties, so much so that it feels unfairly punishing.

Playing against chaos is still a bad experience overall compared to Tyranids. And I don't even feel like touching Lethal difficulty with the game in its current state.

Player numbers are also dwindling down, going as low as 22 thousands concurrently playing tonight. I think the game is already on the way to die, with less than 2 months since its release.

They should have used difficulty 3 enemies health and damage values across all difficulties, and just change the number and type of enemies based on difficulties, like Helldivers 2 does. They have the swarm engine which can show you hundreds of enemies on screen and they barely use its capabilities





All I'm going to say about this most recent update is that whoever developed and approved the cohesion cringe mechanic for the new Lethal difficulty needs to be fired.

Plus, this update as a whole makes me want to uninstall the game, after playing for almost 300 hours total and every single day since its release. Feels like Helldivers 2 all over again!

I'm getting PTSD just writing this




With the latest patch, the game is definitely heading in the right direction and feels much better to play. It’s a lot of fun, and I can now confidently recommend it. As long as future updates keep improving things and don't cause any setbacks, this is shaping up to be something really great, and it already is.

It's almost unbelievable in 2024 to see a development team that’s so competent, knows what they're doing, and can deliver a solid update for their game right from the get-go

The only downside after the latest update is the persistent stuttering, which wasn’t an issue before

The stuttering has been fixed with a hotfix




I've experienced my PC hard freezing twice - once after the prologue mission and another time while attempting to close the game, which forced me to restart my computer. However, since the latest hotfix, I haven't encountered any further issues like this.

For reference, I'm running an AMD Radeon RX 6800 and an i9-10900KF.


Matchmaking in operations is bugged; often, it simply doesn’t work. On top of that, difficulty level 4 operations are frustratingly hard, reminiscent of the problems that have plagued

Here are some specific issues I’ve noticed. These are strictly regarding PvE Operations mode, especially at the highest difficulty 4:


1. it's one of the main reasons the game feels so frustratingly difficult.

2a. : Timing a parry feels unreliable, although it gets better once you get more used to it.
2b: The shield block doesn’t block all blue attacks, which doesn’t make sense to me.

3. You're always scraping for ammo, which feels excessive.

4. Enemies feel like bullet sponges. It takes a lot of melee strikes and ranged shots to bring down medium and heavy enemies (not including bosses, which are mostly fine). Even small units, especially the Chaos ones with shields, are way too tanky.

5. Just 2-3 hits from medium or heavy enemies will bring you down. With the weaker classes you can die instantly even when at full health.
Your armor feels like paper, and you’re constantly running out of it.

6. Chaos is much more frustrating to fight than Tyranids, though Tyranids aren’t much better.

7. Some classes are much more effective than others, with the Assault class being one of the weakest.

8a. Difficulty 4 is necessary to unlock the highest tier weapons, so you're forced to play at that difficulty sooner or later.
8b. A lot of these issues would be solved if weapon progression wasn’t locked behind higher difficulties. Let the hardcore players push through difficulty 4 and above while allowing more casual players to enjoy the game on difficulty 2/3, even if unlocking weapon tiers takes longer.


As a result, a lot of players end up avoiding combat altogether and rushing straight for the final boss/encounter. But if you're avoiding combat in a game like what's the point?

The game desperately needs better balancing, and an FOV slider on top of that. One of Saber developers mentioned that it’s fine for players to feel overpowered in PvE, but not in PvP. Well, as it stands, we actually feel in operations. Even the campaign, on difficulty level 4 is easier, much more fun, and overall more enjoyable.

Speaking of the campaign - it’s one of the best I’ve ever played. So there's that, at least.",2024/9/10,en

lmsslkm,0,10.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lmsslkm/,"I do n’t recommend you to buy this game by war hammers and ordinary players. Not to mention the startup issues and online problems of gaming sex, it is very headache.

Let's talk about technical problems first:
The current game is often 7 hours, and one hour study how to skip EPIC (the task manager ending the EPIC Online Service User Helper program) 3 hours of matching, 3 hours to study how to play with teammates for wireless loading at all.EssenceEssenceIt's better to match with friends.

4-5 hours to play gameplay questions:
Players can perform multiplayer mode after the early chapter, players can choose multiPaign and Operations.But after a comprehensive play, the difficulty design of the game is completely unreasonable.The lowest difficulty played.The feeling of the character's long -range and melee switching design gives me a very uncomfortable fighting battle.

Because I prefer the sniper occupation. Although the sniper is clearing high -quality enemies, the elite enemy and the BOSS battle output are extremely high, but the core of the combat design is to encourage players to alternate melee remotely.The big AOE skill and miscellaneous efficiency.The loading capacity of firearms and weapons is also too low. In the case of low difficulty in early wasteland, high -quality monster sea firepower and ammunition are not enough to clean up.In the miscellaneous soldiers.
(If you want to sniper the ammunition cycle plus the ability to be able to make the character almost full, because the answers are all in the laser sniper of the sniper's talent to kill the ammunition.. So I have to sit at least 20 hours to prison to refreshPlay, right)

When it comes to brushing mechanisms, have you seen the elite monster in the monster of the elite monster?I have appreciated it. I just finished the wave of bullets and consumed the result. As a result, I hid an elite monster and smoke in the corner. I did n’t succeed in the first time.I think this is still the lowest difficulty. I can only hold the small machete to cut it with one knife.EssenceEssenceDo you like to snip the career delete, let's go to the melee.EssenceEssence

At the level, there are currently 6, but if each one is fast, it will be a bit too long if you finish it for half an hour. If you encounter a difficult and difficult to make a mistake, you dare not think about it.EssenceEssence

Summarize:
Because of the defects of the game design, I played most maps for the second time I played my brain that can moisturize and not fight. It is possible to reduce the probability of brushing the tide through the running map to reduce the consumption of map resources.Teammates who can play together, so I can't play with my friends at all now.EssenceEssence",2024/9/6,zh-cn
Fury._-,1,11.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/furyy_rl/,"Okay the game is fun to play and I love it. HOWEVER

UPDATE:
The CPU temp problems have been fixed finally and I don't have to worry about it overheating on me.

This game is my first ever Warhammer game apart from the actual board game itself and I've got to say. I absolutely love everything about it. Just killing so many creatures at the same time with a whole sword and stuff feels extremely satisfying and the gore makes it 100x better too.

The story itself is pretty short but the missions are quite long so you've got around over 8 hours of gameplay with the campaign alone.

The side operations are really fun to do as well as they are linear to the story line of the game.

Aside all that. 9/10 fantastic game, definitely recommend",2024/9/6,en
EMPulse,0,29.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988842298/,"The campaign is okay.It's a rather radical development, but it's rarely ridiculous.
However, the main campaign, which is divided into two main campaigns and PVE campaigns, is a bit short.The average PVE campaign is the average.

The graphics are excellent, the directing is fine, and the chest is magnificent, but people who don't know the Warhammer 40000 setting can just ... Oh, there are many monsters.

In other words, as all other Warhammer 40K games do, it doesn't tell you the world's setting.
In particular, the warp -related settings are a bit unusual ... There is a long -distance scene in the middle, but in the middle, there is no explanation of the situation where communication security is broken and why it is broken.It may be, but it can be understood at all.

If you don't know Warhammer in the first place, if you listen to the word Warp, you should just think about it.

In the end, there is a part that is satisfied only by the 40K fans of the Warhammer, and the new inflow is difficult to expect.
However, it is true that there are some parts that make use of the Wohammer 40K fans that are satisfied with the sights and settings that are satisfactory.


But the game is honestly dislike
First of all, the motions are heavy and dull to save the heavyness of Space Marine.This may be a bit frustrating.
In particular, campaigns often have to fight dogs, but sometimes the motion is slow and heavy and the next command input is delayed.
People who like to be able to manage them and cancel motion can be used to manage this, but those who are more likely to be fps can be annoyed.

And customization is not free to pretend to be fucking free.
First of all, it is difficult to match the skin with the codex standard, or there is no decal for some bottles and characteristics.
There may be some people who want to get a testimony among the 40K fans.
At the same time, Ultramarin is the main character chapter, so it's okay to use Ultramarin, but there are many chapters that use the classification and characteristics that do not follow the codex.

And changing the armor skin and armor color is quite inconvenient.I keep going back and forth, and I have to repeat it.
And PVE, PVP and Skin Settings are the same, but the two should be shared and the two must be separately ....
Another reason why there is no function to delete the armor or color settings?
In addition, when the main campaign comes, there is a bug where all the armor colors set in the multi -to -do Ultramarin are returned to Ultramarin.Save in different colors is also changed to ultramarine color.

I feel that I made PvP quite a bit ...
There is no function to see my total.Didn't you find it?But ... there is no place to go around the battle pants.Why is this not?

Besides, when you enter the game, you will see a video of the map at first ... I can't skip it.Even if I was in the middle!
That's why Gem is already running inside, but I have to be watching the map.
Of course, this is a 50: 150 picture of this.Of course, our team is 50

And Chaos is not just as free as the imperial smash.Skin is fixed and fixed, and it is possible to change color or some decals.This is a bit disappointing.
So if you don't care about it, you can also like the Southern Line Color Corn Buzzer.

Finally
As a Warhammer 40K fan, the campaign attraction is excellent, but
As a multiplayer game, the game is somewhat poor ...

As a Warhammer 40K fan, the campaign score is 9 points
I think the game score of multiplayer games is 6.5 points.

Therefore, if you can't die at 40K Warhammer, it is recommended as a standard purchase, but if not, it is honestly C -class

Kharos,1,146.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKharos/,"This is one of those times when I wish there was a middle ground between Recommended and Not Recommended. Aside from what are largely circumstantial issues, such as the Epic Games integration and performance problems that some people are having, neither of which I have personally had a problem with; there are things that this game does right, and things that it does worse than the first game. I don't normally write reviews, and especially ones that are longer than a few sentences, but I feel like I have to say at least a few things about every general aspect of the game here.

To start with the good sides:
- Story: It serves its predecessor well, it answers a lot of questions with some subtle references which I really liked, and is overall well written, especially when compared to some of the recent 40k lore.
- Visuals: The sense of scale is impressive, the fidelity is as you would expect from a AAA title, and the animation work is unique in the sense that it doesn't necessarily copy from either Space Marine or Astartes, but has its unique take on depicting space marines which is fluid and satisfying.
- Audio: It's not on the same level as Darktide, especially in the soundtrack, but it gets the job done quite well in a lot of places. There are a few disappointing sounds, like the heavy bolter, but it otherwise manages to feel atmospheric.

Now the bad or mediocre sides:
- Gameplay: It's so hit and miss. When you break it down on paper, it sounds good, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The ranged combat is okay; the weapons are a bit too inaccurate during longer bursts for being carried by the superhuman warriors that space marines are, and most of them feel the same, with a lot feeling like they're less powerful than their counterparts in the first game, or fulfilling a purpose that another weapon can fulfill better. It's the melee combat that is the main problem. You're better off playing it like Dark Souls and rolling around, both in PVE and PVE, because parry is simply too inconsistent. It doesn't matter if you perfectly time your parry if you are already playing an animation, like an attack, because you cannot cancel that animation. This problem gets worse when the attacks, even for the knife and chainsword, are much slower and clunkier than their counterparts in the first game. Additionally, in PVE, enemies can interrupt your attacks by hitting you, but you cannot interrupt theirs using the same method, which makes it not only feel unfair, but also weightless. The animation-pause does more to hurt the experience than help, as timing gets offset every time you hit something. Finally, melee in PVP can be cheated easily by just rolling, kind of like you can cheat the PVE by just rolling. Do not even try for parrying, it's a gamble. All of this makes the combat feel unfinished or badly designed, and I really hope this is addressed because it is currently my biggest pet peeve about the gameplay.
- Customisation: Nonexistent for Chaos, and practically nonexistent for space marines. With Chaos, each class is limited to a warband, so if you're playing a raptor for example, you will be a Night Lord. You can change colours, but you will still retain Night Lord model pieces, same goes for the other classes and warbands. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist for Chaos. For the Primaris, it is also very lackluster. There are less options than there were in the first game, and they're lacking in the variety department, especially when it comes to chapter-specific content. Also, please, for the love of the Emperor, give us back Space Marines. Not Primaris. Space Marines. Not everyone likes the Primaris designs, and I certainly don't. But I feel like this would fall on deaf ears, it's not like GW ever listens to what the community wants.

Overall, it's a decent game. It's hard to judge because there are parts that are very good, and then there's a couple parts that are really bad, and it's hard to dictate which one outweighs the other because they're largely dependent on what the user expects from the game.",2024/9/6,en
Recluse,1,31.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrantoftheisles/,"Writing a review for non-Warhammer fans, so if you're into Warhammer, I'll just say that this game will probably scratch whatever itch you've got. Go for it. The game was literally made for you.

If, however, you're not somebody who's into playing as a tacky-looking action figure, fighting against barely-legally-distinct xenomorphs, then I'd like to give an honest review after my short time with the game to help you get a bit more of an idea.

Ranged weapon variety? Forget it. You, at time of writing, basically have four major options - some form of 'bolter' (every gun that fires bullets is a bolter, I guess?) that are all more or less very same-feeling, a 'melta' (fire shotgun), some plasma weapons that all differ very slightly from one another, and then sniper rifles. They all get the job done, but none of them feel particularly satisfying. Animation-wise, a lot of the larger enemies don't react to shots whatsoever, so these weapons don't feel particularly 'punchy.' I'd give the actual shooting experience in the game something like a 4/10 - clunky controls, weird aiming system (which is justified by the hybrid ranged/melee control scheme, but that doesn't make it any less weird and clunky) and a lack of visual feedback often just makes you feel like your guns aren't doing much, even if they are.

Melee weapons? That's the good part of this game. Many melee weapons, all with unique combos to learn and enjoy, and individualized strengths even though they, theoretically, should all pretty much do the same thing. They cooked here. 9/10 melee system, very good. Lots of focus on countering and dodges, or knowing how to pull off combos without getting your health bar torn apart.

General aesthetics? Look, I get it, some people adore Warhammer and Space Marines, but like... they're ugly. Horribly ugly. Like something a middle schooler would draw in the back of a notebook while they're not paying attention in math class. To make things worse, the game has you earn cosmetics - perfectly fine on its own! - and the cosmetics will be... a laughably tiny change. ""Congratulations, your reward for completing 40 different 30 minute long missions is - we put a strip of paper on your pauldron!"" Again, I'm sure this is something meaningful for the crowd that happily throws away thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on figures of these guys, but for somebody who isn't all that into it... it's just a strip of paper with a seal. Not a very good reward. Your best aesthetic customization is going to be in colors, and there you have more room to work with, but at the heart of your look you'll always be the same, really ugly action figure.

At present, I only played PVE and wrote a little bit of opinion. I hope the big guy will not spray me.

I feel that the game is good and I can give a recommendation, but there are too many places to improve.


1. Add more difficulty levels. Now there are only 4 difficulty levels. I personally think that the span of level 3 to 4 is too large (maybe I compare the dishes) to add a level between level 3 and level 4.

2. Strengthen the player's weapons (yes, that is, all) including attack speed, damage, etc.
The Star Warrior was holding a shotgun instead of a BB gun, and a chain sawing sword instead of a branch in his hand.
There are almost no other weapons that can be used except for hot melt.
Ask everywhere how to fight 4, and the response to only get hot melt.

The specific method of strengthening:

Blasting the shotgun should strengthen the damage and add some range damage

(After all, it is a bomb, where the caliber is placed there, the 0.75 inches is almost 20 centimeters faster. It can imagine that a 20mm cannon has this damage.)

Strengthen the damage and overheating of the plasma/plasma gun

The plasma/plasma guns of my tactics and special warfare are unlocked. Due to the damage and overheating problems of the plasma/plasma gun, I can hardly see it now.
Especially the special combat plasma/plasma gun is too easy to overheat. I don't know if it is my problem, but I feel that it will be overheated without a few guns.

Strengthen the attack speed, damage and retreat of melee weapons

Strange can be strong, but can you squeeze the player in the middle when you let a lot of monsters rush to the face?
At present, I personally feel that I have not repelled this concept. I can only roll around by the monsters. I keep pressing the space and using invincible frames to escape.
The damage is also. Under the difficulty, hitting a knife ax, cutting for a long time is a bit useful, and the player must fall to the ground to cut a few times.
In terms of attack speed, why do so many people blow daggers .... Isn't it because they can't die, then increase the speed, anyway, the damage is not bad anyway.

3. Enhanced waist shooting
In a word, dare to ask the quasi of this waist shooting is to learn WOT next door?IntersectionIntersection
The bullets hit, like the shell next door, can be crooked and outrageous.


4. Add equipment system
Such as grenade bags, magazine bags, amulets, etc.


5. Improve the upper limit
For example, the movement speed is increased, the recoil decreases, or the damage is improved, etc.

6. Add more occupations
Think tank, pharmacist, etc.

7. I hope there can be more battles in the future, such as playing the Star Army or Chaos.

8. In the future, adding a large battlefield mode and adding a random terrain system. The model of the Jedi dive 2 is really in line with Star Warrior.

There are so many temporarily, I hope you can be happy in the game!",2024/9/9,zh-cn

■ Partial corrections and apology
You can play in story mode by inviting the Steam friend
It is impossible to cross play in story mode (invited PS user)
There is no story mode matching function

Limited, but cooperative play in story mode was possible
I'm sorry to post a review without verifying it properly
I apologize and correct it
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――


There is a lie in the product description.

It may be bad, but I feel that way
The previous work has not been played, but I was looking forward to checking the information before the release.
I watched a lot of introduction videos such as YouTube, but it can be said that this YouTuber was also dripping lies.

What is it?This work is not a cooperative shooter
[Protect the empire in three people cooperative play!] And the cooperation play that sells this game in the Steam introduction page
Or the phrase introducing a diverse department is dancing
In the videos of YouTuber, the introduction of each government, the evolution of weapons, the growth elements of improving the skills, and the armor staplation
I was sending fun information such as

They are not applied to Study Modes

I say again, but it is not applied
The story mode to sortie at a three -person party is a unique character of NPC except yourself.
There is no cooperation play
There are no elements of the above weapons, improving skills, and armor stamizes
The weapons used during the mission have another weapon across the movie scene
Special skills (power -ups and jump packs) are also automatically assigned for each story scene.
In other words, it is just to experience the story of Warhammer40000 alone.
The cooperation shooter with a growth factor is not said.

In the game mode called operations different from the story mode
You will play cooperative play that contains these elements
However, this operation is a system that feels gradually opened as the story progresses.
(Because the operation itself contains a story spoiler)
It's not a problem in the long run
People who are critical to the lies of this game are the most
The person who bought it with his friends in hopes of cooperative play like Halo or Gears

The main elements that advertise extensively are the characteristics of the game
I feel that it is very dishonest to be applied only to some game mode.

---postscript---
I made a relaxing story in about 10 hours
Characters and relationships that would be connected from the previous work
The hero's past is made on the premise that the player knows, and there is almost no explanation in the game.
So I don't know.

The general command of Ultramarine is also a friend of the player and the old knowledge.
I want to carry out an important strategy, but I can't get in touch with the general commander.
I can't give information other than ""big and strong""
A plenty of atmosphere with the skull on the Ultramarine fleet, and maybe one of the main characters.
At the end of the story, I remove the skull surface in a meaningful manner
The protagonist, Titus, reacts like ""You were you ...""
Players probably don't know 1mm.Because there is no information

After clearing, you will play ""Operation Mode"" with cooperation play elements.
To be honest, too much ...

For example, Halo and Gears have finished the long story mode with plenty of satisfaction.
There is a ""mode to enjoy the act of donpachi with the enemy"" like this work.
It was really purely the desire to fight against the enemy and enjoy it.

It's a special MAP prepared just for fighting, or an easy -to -understand area.
It was an enemy attack (WAVE) that is introduced at the right time

This work has a partially cut out of the progress of the story, but the details are different.
1.Where and where
2.Do this task
3.Finally defeat the boss

We will proceed with the progress of the same navigation as the story.
I feel like I defeat it because there is an enemy on the way

So I feel dissatisfied with the fact that there are various impurities between pure donpachi.
More like this, I sit down in one area and squeeze it with a hammer while keeping the hordes of enemies coming from one to the next.
It was good like that.

Furthermore, by clearing the stage, you will gain uniform experience and acquire tactical skills and custom equipment.
Various elements, such as ""number of enemies defeated, number of special kills, number of times they helped friends""
Because it is hardly reflected as an experience (very small)
It is not meaningful to defeat the enemy, even though it is in a mode that is wachawacha with the enemy, so it is more efficient to pass through and clear quickly.
It feels like a chiggle
In particular, there are many people who go through the enemies on the way and go quickly because they know that when they match with high -level people.


I don't want to get bored because it's still in the first play period.
But it looks a little tired
I feel like that

I hope that if you increase the difficulty and acquire skills, you may be able to get some fun.",2024/9/9,ja

If you have managed to avoid spoilers, you have absolutely no idea what is going on to you.
Every time you say: This is the most epic thing I've ever seen, the game can trump it.

- Variety of weapons and armor is cool
- Graphics are faint in cutscene, but the worlds are made absolutely unstable and your chin will fall from the scenery.
- Already in EA the game goes without any problems, stutters and falls.(So ​​far I have only played a solo campaign, I can't say how it is with matchmaking on COOP and so on)
- I have 4090 and 13900K, so I can't say too objectively as the game goes on weaker sets, but I think everything is fine in my opinion, just a little more demanding in more hectic situations.(I think the falls somewhere to some 55 fps at native 2K and the cleaned settings.
- Some steamers slapped that the game could be flew in less than 6 hours.I would like to see the passages ... It must have been more sweaty than me in the last 3 weeks.For a mortal, the campaign has about 11 hours as Devs complained.
- If you are a fan of 40k ... I would not hesitate.
The only minus and point down is possible the amount of content when you have a 11 -hour campaign and then 6 missions from which each other number of hours, but I would actually see it on such ... 30 - 40h before you unlock everything and startthat bored.
- But the roadmap is out, other content is supposed to come, and now it will only be developers for how long, this great game can keep alive.

1. The claim regarding the support of the widescreen monitors is not only heresy, but also the complete lack of desire to study the information, but as a result not to find out that the developers warned in advance that this very support would be added in the same month, so you either sit either, endure and wait, or do not buy the game until they add it, otherwise some were different here.

2. Next, we go to the problems of optimization and flights incomprehensible to me and many other people.When I read reviews that people with 30 and 40 series of video cards fly out and frisit game, then I fall out of this.Who are these people?Where do they come from?
Then I read positive reviews, people from the 20th, 30th and 40th series of video cards calmly play the game and do not complain, and the processors are not very different from those who write negative reviews, so many are also surprised at those who meet problems with optimization.And some, judging by the reviews, manage to calmly play in the GTX series.And I understand that it’s foolish for me to say something with my 4090 and i9-13900K, since I have a calm 110-125 FPS in 4K on the ultras and 70-80, but when I saw the complaints to the quality of it.Optimization, then it became bad for me.
And either it is a matter of an individual PC configuration, or people simply do not know what FSR and DLSS are, or these are really some heretics and adherents of chaos, but it is possible that this is just a combination of everything at once.

In terms of gameplay, the game is what you need, zaruba, meat, blood, purely run and make the local original graves from a third -person.The plot campaign for the time of passage and fullness is about the same as in the first part, in fact, it simply is, but it is also quite good.They brought a normal Russian voice acting, everything as promised, pleasant.Long -term PVE mode, or rather operations with pumping for nerds, I have it, I love it.PVP mode for me just exists, I have forced my love for a long time, but let it be, they don’t force him to play.If there are friends, then the buzz, it is more interesting to go through the plot with them, and to master the content more fun.
I myself am not to say that I am a huge fan of this universe and an unreal Loroveda, just an amateur and layman, I know something, something is not, and I can just only recommend this game, because, as far as I know, good games on Vahe come outIt is rare enough, and this is one of them.",2024/9/6,ru

SM2 is kinda like Gears of War or God of War I guess. Its core gameplay is fun but unfortunately very shallow and repetitive. It lacks any meaningful RPG mechanics. The story is short, not replayable, and you can't significantly customize your main hero. The squad mates are also not customizable, and are dumb as bricks. I did almost finish the campaign and it was alright, mid at best.


I also just put a few hours into the main ""meat"" of the game, which are the coop Operations. And yeah, I simply don't see myself continuing to play this. The levels are super linear, but movements is so slow and in combat you're stuck inside animations for half the time. Combat = parry simulator, and honestly the Batman games did this much better. Clearly the game was meant for console peasan...I mean players, and ported over to PC. It worked for them, the game sold a lot. But MKB feels terrible. The progression seems fine, but the loop is just not there for me.

Simplistic, shiny spectacle would be my best description of SM2. I wasn't familiar with the first game, so I didn't really know what to expect. Extremely overhyped by game reviewers, and I totally fell for it.

Runs well, looks good, but gotta give it a thumbs down. Game will probably settle in around Mostly Positive, which is exactly what it deserves.

For that Warhammer feel, for me personally, I'm just gonna go back to Darktide and Helldivers. For this type of combat, the Batman games are vastly superior as Bruce doesn't fight as if he weighs like a ton of bricks, sloshing his weight around in slow mo.",2024/9/10,en

What about the graphone?The whole area looks like after the raid of cosmosaks, garbage bins burn around, broken glass shines, and there are whole barricades from empty bottles.On the planet, not a single whole corner - everything is broken, broken, as after a party of galactic students!

The gaples are generally not a fool!We have a complete set here - searches, raids, interrogations with elements of galactic folklore.Lupi on the back with a shocker, and if the suspect rustled, you can cut it on the head for prevention!And if you came across a chaos, a corrupt bureaucrat - arrange a raid, pull the Zhban into the site and apply administrative sanctions right on the spot!Tityushkin has two instruments - a rod and cosmocodex, and believe me, he has all the article!

If you miss the mid 2000s games like Gear Of War you will love this one! No Coporate greed BS, no DEI, no ""suprise mechanics"", just big dudes killing big things. My updated review after completing the campagin on veteran and countless OP Missions: this is the best non-RTS 40K game out there at the moment! The last view fights of the campaign are the most 40K boner-material there is!!

Gameplay: Art, graphics, music, atmosphere are top notch. Its war everywhere, like it should be, the weapons have a punch, gore is deliciously over the top. Campaign is a little repetitive during the first half, a problem the first game had too. The second half of the game is amazing with new enemies, guns, locations etc.
Corporate greed/BS: No lootboxes, no microtransactions! Campaign can be played offline, OPs with bots.
Bugs: During the campaign I had one animation bug. Multiplayer was great, I had some connection issues once but thats it.
Balancing: The classes need finetuning in OP/MP, also some weapons.
Difficulty: Played campaign on veteran. Its a challenge sometimes, the defense sections can be hard, but otherwise than that its doable.
Multiplayer: Coop so far was VERY fun and this is where SM2 shines the most!

Verdict so far: To my knowledge everything is lore accurate, they went into great detail in this one. Big dudes with bigger weapons killing stuff, this is what I want to see! If you know 40K you will love this game, its a love letter to all the fans!

For everyone who waited for the continuation of the story of Captain Demetrian Titus, Saber Interactive decided to prepare one of the biggest surprises when it comes to the premieres of 2024.Ultramarine dubbed by the fantastic Marek Strong returns, and with him and you will have the opportunity to face the greatest enemies of humanity in the Warhammer world embedded in the 40th Millennium.Is this a successful return?I will not expose myself to the Inquisition if I say - by all means!

The Emperor Protects!

Over 200 years have passed since the events of the first part of the game, during which Titus took its penance in the ranks of the Death Guard.In playable tutorial, we accompany him during one of the operations in which the hero almost loses his life, face to face with the overwhelming forces of the Tyranids and dueling with a huge Carnifex.The ""Emperor protects"", however, they are not words thrown on the wind, so our hero is put together on board the warship and once again finds a trace of the conspiracy of chaos forces.

The story skeleton remains similar to the one we know from the first part.Fighting with Tyranids turns out to be an introduction to the invasion of chaos, and reckless fun with the relics of the warp, which are done by priests Adeptus mechanicus, as they do nothing, they remind the player similar inquisition practices from the first part of the adventures of the Space Marine.The action rushes so rapidly that instead of thinking about the meanders of the script and so you will rather rush with the hammer and bolter to fight, so instead of looking for holes in the whole, it is better to look at what is the most important part of the game - fight!


Aliens will cut, crush and tear to shreds with a quite large arsenal, definitely larger than in the first part.In melee combat you will use four different types of weapons, there will be several types of lateral weapons and a dozen major rifles and thrills for a short, medium and long distance.

Arsenal quite substantial, but the size is justified if you look at who we will fight with.Somehow the creators managed to prepare even greater clashes than in the first part, and thanks to the skills of Titus, throwing even at several dozen enemies at once you will not feel flawless.A mix of struggle in a metering and use of lateral weapons will not only provide constant pressure on opponents, but in sensitive moments executions on enemies will renew the life and armor of our hero.Fight is a real visit to the slaughterhouse - blood bursts in all directions, cut off limbs and torn bodies will be densely under the feet of the powerful armor of our hero.

I remembered the first part of the game myself as a fairly monotonous break through the next waves of opponents.In my opinion, the two is definitely more dynamic, and the greater number of the hero's abilities in melee combat, weapons and diversity of the mission makes us feel involved all the time in what we see on the screen.


Noteworthy is both the graphic and sound design - in my opinion, both really make a great impression.On the screen swarms enemies, both in the air and on earth, the Tyranids storm the positions of the Imperial Guard again and again and try to interrupt our hero and his team.This is obviously accompanied by suggestive sounds of explosions, screams of enemies and allies.Bolter ribbing, air -piercing the sound of lasers and wrapping into the ground of a powerful electric hammer season the shivers on their backs, and if we add really nice dubbing and actors who speak their issues with commitment, we get a really successful mix.


- a bloody shave without a handle;
- satisfying fighting;
- improved shortcomings of the first part;
- nice graphic design;
- great sound setting;

- too clearly repeats the story scheme of the first part;
- occasional problems with connection with other players;
- some development of Titus's ability could be useful, and not just the accompanying warriors as part of the operation;
- no side activity in the operational base;
- relatively little mission in the Operations mode (although new ones are still coming);",2024/9/9,pl

All the gameplay in the PVP is just Team Shot!No matter how hard you try even the most notorious yes*we will kill you if there are two and you and they in an open position you have no chance to wrap this situation in your direction!

Good customization where ?????
1 day from days I was thrown only over the side of chaos, which simply has no customization, but the company does not include the game for chaos because it is heresy and the inquisitors have already left for me, but Bl ** b in one prescription in the network mode withoutopportunities, something to change except the order, this is the same heresy as to complain about the single ""aaaaaaaaaaa"" game with poor PVP


A class with a shield is a separate type of autism, how do you not try, which weapon do not use it to the phh*ru, they just stand and absorb damage, for example, girls have an energy shield that breaks down why you can’t make a stamine at the thyroid gland so that it is like yes*N did not stand with a clamped block button or that the percentage of damage from getting over time increases?But apparently there was no desire to think about PVP mode!

I hope they will work on PVP and develop as I would not want to quickly forget about this game!
It can also be interesting for the developers to add any DLC and other content to keep a large number of players in the game for a long time, since now the situation is that the company with a calm gameplay can pass for 8 hours, if not less, and then, what?Just forget?

The continuation of the ultramarine adventures did not disappoint.The action is intense, full of amazing moments that make me feel like the Emperor himself led me to battle.The fight against the hordes of the Tyranid is a pure pleasure for every fan of this world.Animations, sounds, and especially the design of enemies and environments, reflect the dark and Gothic atmosphere of 41 Millenium.Every step of the hero - from Bolter's roar, through majestic explosions, to the sound of heavy space marine shoes on a metal surface - reminds me why Warhammer 40,000 is a universe full of amazing depth and a unique atmosphere.

The game mechanics have been improved in relation to the previous part.New movements and liquidity in combat allow you to feel like a real Astartes - superhuman fast, strong and ruthless.To this, let's add epic clashes that show the vastness and complexation of Warhammer's battles.

Most importantly, Space Marine 2 is not just a action game - this is an experience that allows you to feel the pride and glory of Ultramarines who guard the Empire.Warhammer universe fans will definitely be delighted, seeing how faithfully devoted Lore, and new story threads only deepen the interest in this fantastic world.

For each fan - both a novice and veteran since 1998 - Space Marine 2 is a must -have position that perfectly combines the dynamics of action game with the rich heritage of Warhammer 40,000.I recommend it with all my heart!",2024/9/8,pl

Mister Kad,1,45,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mister_Kad/,"Gonna be completely honest, after the first 30 minutes of optimization hell, I am safe to say that the early trials were worth it. A story that sticks to the core of 40k, the beautiful, immersive set pieces. This is THE 40k game I've been waiting for. The combat system has taken some time to get used to, but there's nothing more satisfying than pulling off a chain of executions and heavy hitting slams into the horde that surrounds you (before you turn the entire place into a red mist). And it's not just the melee. The ranged weapons have the most satisfying bolter punches I've seen in a 40k game yet.

The multiplayer PVP mode could use some balancing, and the campaign AI really needs a tweak or two, but this is something that nobody is a stranger to at this point. It's an expected headache when you make gameplay surrounding co-op and then give us robots with the brains of a sloth to back us up.

In addition to the plot, there are 6 operations that occur parallel to the main plot.You can play with bots, but it hurts to play the difficulties above normal with bots, because they are stupid, do not finish enemies, do not capture points and do not perform various plot actions, and one thing is difficult to have everywhere.Therefore, I recommend playing in a cooperative.Fortunately, the selection of players is quickly.
Multiplayer battles in the classics are fast and simple.Although now there are players who perfectly studied locations and pumped their fighters.But pumping is a matter of time.Just play and enjoy.

DELTA ㋛,1,44.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DELTICH/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a purebred video game that is not ashamed to be what it is.Your goal is to just come and destroy everything in your path, nothing more.At the same time, the developers took a bold step, completely abandoning any pumping of a hero or weapon in the plot campaign.If you are tired of the next anniversary and other modern games, where for five minutes the gameplay accounts for 30 minutes of digging in different menu, so that the impact power becomes 1% more, and you just want to chop the mobs to parts with beautiful graphics and a steep fighting - SpaceMarine 2 is for you.

Space Marine II works on the Swarm Engine on its own engine, and this is perhaps one of the few games that finally demonstrate the very “almost non-nectogen”.From the details of the environment, the armor of the characters, the range of drawing, amazing lighting and the scale of the game, sometimes simply breathtaking.One of the most noticeable changes in the game is its visual design, detailed models of characters and surroundings, gloomy, bloody landscapes and epic and large -scale scenes of battles create an indescribable atmosphere, which perfectly corresponds to the spirit of the Universe of Warhammer 40k.The sound design is also at a height - dynamic and tense battles are accompanied by powerful sound effects and grand musical accompaniment, which makes each battle even more memorable.The developers also took into account the criticism and reviews of players about the first part, introducing a number of significant improvements.One of the main innovations was a cooler and deeper fighting.Now players have to face even more diverse enemies, each of which requires a special approach and strategy.The system of pumping the characters was also significantly expanded, providing more opportunities for customization and development of the hero’s skills (but this is mostly done for a coope, for the campaign, just a choice of weapons was made, and 2 two types of armor, if you have Delux publication).

The plot in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 stars from the sky is not enough, but it has become more saturated.He continues to develop the history of the original, but at the same time introduces new elements that add depths.The characters, both new and familiar from the first part, received more worked out stories and motivation, which allows players to plunge deeper into what is happening.You can describe the whole plot literally in two sentences, since the story here is more likely to blow something up and destroy someone.Most of the tasks boils down to the fact that the heroes should lay a bomb, draw a gun or prevent monsters from destroying an important object, and the main conflict develops against the background, only in the final third makes itself felt.In principle, the plot in the Warhammer universe is not required.

If you summarize, the new Space Marine in 2024 looks like an ideal militant in the world of Warhammer 40k, like a genre Messiah, with a bolter in one hand and a pilome in the other.The new part undoubtedly justified all my expectations and brought many innovations that make the game not only with popcorn and meat spectacle with excellent graphics, exciting sound design and improved mechanics, but also represents a worthy continuation, so to say the “successful” original.If you are a fan of the Warhammer 40k universe or just like high-quality action games like Gear of War, this continuation is definitely worth your attention.Despite a number of shortcomings spent in the SPACE MARINE II plot campaign, 10 hours gave me one of the most pleasant impressions in 2024 - this is exactly the last five years for us.",2024/9/7,ru

Where is the agenda?Why are there no women Astartes?!


Play only at the highest level of complexity, seriously!


Meat game, a great continuation of the first part!
This is if in a nutshell, then in the game.
The beginning, for me personally it was unexpected, from the landing of the Cauls of Death Council!Where are the ultramarins?!
And only when our cosmodes took off his helmet, everything fell into place :)

It is simply impossible to convey the delight from the meat cut of tyranids!Especially if you play the jastics from the PS5, feel the resistance of the trigger with each shot, the vibration when running to every step adds the feeling of the severity of space -cosmodes, the relics of the bolter!





When at the beginning of the game you are shown the swarm of the Tiranids running, somewhere there in the far, it doesn’t bother you much, this is the background, right?After all, so?!
But as this huge crowd approaches, you understand that this is not a background, that these are not static boobs, this is a really huge crowd of enemies that you need to dig out alone!And they will not stop the high walls, they are like those zombies from the film with delirium Petrovich, these xenos will simply build a living staircase and come for you!





In the first hours, I was dying more than once, but this did not scare me off to transmit to a lighter difficulty, on the contrary, the action is so perky, bloody, brutal that I want hardcore!
The fighting is not very complicated: there is a chain sword or a knife for close combat, there is a bolt pistol and a full-fledged bolter, and of course there is a dodger and parrying.
Tactics of battle:
While the enemy is far away, we shoot from the bolter.
When it’s close, the bass with a sword, we parry, restore HP.
Restore armor with finishing off.

By the way, the parrying kills a trifle immediately, and a more serious enemy for a moment, for our attack by a chain sword.Here is the finishing of a large game is especially bloody!Then the cosmodes will tear off the claw of tyranid and put it under the rib, then the spine will tear out, then he will trample the head ... Brr ... tin!





The graphics here are not bad, that is not bad, not perfect.As for me, graphics, it could be better, but this is my opinion.
Yes, there are a lot of graphic trifles, blood flows through the armor and a cloak of GG, the dirt clings to the boots of the armor and spreads to the sides of the thunder dial, the explosions, the elements of the armor are quite detailed.
BUT!On the first planet, the flower crown is such a strange fading gray .... When you go into the buildings, the brightness of the flowers returns.I don't know, I can do it wrong in brightness)

On my not a top bucket, the game goes with subsidence up to 70 FPS at maximum settings (with the exception of blur in the movement, turned off for nafig).

At the time of writing, connect to the servers, that’s still a quest.Therefore, the company is held in offline mode.But as soon as the game starts for the standard of publication, I will pass (or may already reproduce) a company with a friend.

PVP mode has not yet watched, perhaps I will supplement the review later.





I took the ultra publication and did not regret it!

So yes it's a corridor game, but in reality it makes you good to come back to the basics of the video game.

Here we are there for pure and hard fun.(Unlike a Helldivers who asks in the face of the tyranids to remain a discreet max and speed run the objectives, while in front of the terminators where MAP control) must be checked)

And yes the thermal baths are said.

The technology used to generate hordes of enemies will not make you lose FPS, unlike visual effects.It is beautiful and important to be highlighted.

Zero Try hard even in PVP.I thought I would make PVE but the pvp is fun.

The emperor strongly invites you to contribute to making a fight, for the oldest it is a bit like Quake but in TPS.

Leave him a chance and I promise you that you are having fun.

I'm new to the Warhammer universe, except for having played a couple hours of Darktide and while some of the deeper lore is going over my head, I still find the story pretty easy to follow. Gameplay is super smooth and addicting to hit combos. Graphics are amazing and sheer panic I feel seeing a horde barreling towards me is a new but welcome feeling.

While still getting into the game and there's a lot more to get into, wanted to at least leave an early, positive review to help counteract the tinfoil hat reviewers leaving negative reviews due to the epic games launcher.

Although close and distant fighting mechanics are designed in the gameplay section, sometimes forced to fight close fight can restrict strategic freedom.When it becomes difficult to make a distance due to the speeds of the enemies, even if you do not want to find yourself in close fight.This can be restrictive for those who prefer different ways of gameplay.

In terms of content, it is possible to say that the number of tasks is slightly limited.More diversity and tasks adding will increase the re -playability of the game in the long run.Also, the diversity of weapons could have been more, because some of the existing weapons are quite similar.Nevertheless, the game offers a pleasant experience in its current form and I hope that the deficiencies will be solved with advancing updates.

I haven't had the opportunity to try PVP mode and multiplayer tasks yet, but considering the overall quality of the game, I think these modes will be satisfactory.I believe that these modes will be fun and competitive thanks to the action -packed structure of the game and different classes.

The combat system is a lot of fun and timing.
Normally it is a pleasant gaming experience, usually you know why you need the apothecarius.


Above all, I like the degree of detail of the models and the surrounding area, has already stood space several times and enjoyed the battle scenes and the ambience.When a swarm comes from hormagant and stacks on top of each other to get to you.Simply wonderful.Afterwards, to do it professionally with fragment grenades.

Campaign Feritg and it is a shame at the end that in my eyes you have given away potential (3rd people).Finally, they use their tech at the end and activate them.
Why the tyranid end mid -game as an opponent disappears is also not clear to me.After all, you started an invasion.The swarm understanding is only interested in the fact that he gets new matter, from whom or what does it matter.

So enough complained.

Is the game good?Yes.

Is the game heavy?Okay.

Is it worth buying?If you have the money and you won't spend on more important things for sure.

Is there a lot of customization anyway?It has, but I found it somehow limited to some things (for example wanting to paint a certain part of Power Armor but not power because it was well ""widespread"" to coloring), and of course they have basically put all theCustomizations such as ""buyable"" with points you earn when you play missions in operations mode, something else, a business that I found in a way ""Paia"" was the fact that you will not be able to paint the chapter champion armor (in this caseThere are only overseas so far but most likely it will be worth it to release in the future too).

Which version is worth taking?Dude, it depends on whether you like the franchise or not, Season Pass that is given in Gold will be more to get new customizations than anything else, if you get the ultra just take if you think you play with a minigun (or someAnother heavy trabuco) Style The TF2 Heavy is cool/fun (the class is cool but I prefer to play full melee), I would recommend taking the standard if you are not someone who already enjoy the W40k universe/thematic.

Can you play solo or is it mandatory to have a friend to play together?Bicho, you can play solo, the bot is kind of dumb but it helps.The game to play with friends is very good, and if you want to play the ""Operations"" mode that is the PVE mode of the game (outside the campaign), matchmaking is very fast, not to mention that it has PVP modethat there are a lot of people playing at the moment.

Do you have a lot of variety of weapon?More or less.Currently there are the ""stamped stickers"" of the franchise, some of them are kind of corner because there are stronger weapons (kind of not so balanced) in the future, what they spoke and Roadmap, new weapons will be added, so justwait.

Is the campaign too long?Man, from what I have seen, not so much, it's 20 -hour talk to what it seems (this with you taking your time and playing in calm), despite that, for what I played, I enjoyed the course of the story and progression.What will give the game longevity is more PVE mode and PVP.


(Only an addendum, as I said, the game is very heavy, and apparently has some bugs such as invisible enemies and/or your character also invisible, I personally have not witnessed any bugs so far, game is running good (despitethat my pc is a why to run the game))

The cheap fighting brother feelings, the brothers Guishan also has it, and the ICU war god has also exceeded the difficulties. You can’t find a better hammer game than this on the market, but this is also a hammer approval.The happiest and saddest point.
———————————————————————————————————————————
Next, let's deduct points
The only special martial arts or wolf cubs from the family's hair from the home of the Killing Team from the beginning of the killing team originally thought that after being the original P Starmer's warrior, I could give me the whole point of atonement and expected the technology and ruthlessness that I haven't seen in 100 years.Live, then turn on the weapon library to see the slow firing speed shotgun, fast shooting shotgun, big magazine burst shotgun, mirror explosion shotgun, three -point shooting shotgun and bomb -preparation very few shotgunsEssence
Well, after finishing the plot, the motion mode is realized that those humorous shotguns are all used for funny original P toys. The entire game can be used in two guns, which are hot melt and multi -tube hot melt without bringing with hot melt without bringing with hot melt without bringing it with it.The hot -melt original P was drowned in the shit of the nest's waterway. This is the self -confidence given by the original P weapon library, Kiliman!Dola!Where is my ammunition?IntersectionWhat about I built a gun?What about my gravity cannon?
But in the most poke, I laugh at the skill tree that directly copys the dark tide. How can I even copy the halo of the humorous mosquito legs of the soldiers?However, the four thieves next door facing the tide of the corpse tide without injuries, the blood was full of blood, and the grenade was brushed, and the three original P brush waves and worms here were sweaty.The red -letter warrior on the face with the murderer team with the murderer sacred beetle terminator or even rolled directly into the eaves and turned into a marathon.Essence
Say a joke: ""Death is my skill"" (he really said this)
For a little bit, for this set of humorous skill trees and weapon development systems, we must make the first six pictures of the first shot of the liver.After the epic game experience of the Blood Crazy Tyrannosaurus King, I finally couldn't help laughing and became a fool.
As a game that wants to operate for a long time, the stacking is necessary, and some of his campaign stacking can be regarded as qualified, and the cooperation mode as the core of the game and the battle mode that has been given by the Wind Moon Film War Troupe,He is unqualified. At this stage, there are too little and too few. He only hopes that you should not pay tribute to the legendary operation in the long -term operation.

Finally, the Space Chaoxiong has also ushered in its own free upgrade. It is difficult to mention the difficulty. The enemy's strength and wave frequency are super enhanced. Special units are one by one.Lecart poke me?When I went to the seed of dazzling wolf cubs that year, can you be mixed with this half of the heart?What is even more terrible is that the desire to attack the brain bugs and the emulsion of the Changshu Mandarin, who played a group of Boolong plus female diol, even soared.
CSM is heavyweight. Seeing a wave of enemies on the screen, the next second corner of the enemy came out of the two sage beetle teriters plus a wizard and brushed three red -letter fighters behind this.Essence
In addition to the melee judgment of the cutting attack system, the distance and invincible time of the rolling tumbling and invincible time, the most inexplicable change is that his aiming and accuracy time of the poison cannon was randomized.Come to roll into a passionate look at the aiming line, and immediately lose half of the blood when you are crooked. The real restoration of the modern Sangirf is a crispy game experience that can only be raised to the dragon.
Even if it is, add a brotherhood system copied from the dark tide, and the fighting brothers must approach each other to return to the armor!And I turned over the 10th version of CODEX without seeing where I wrote that there were no fighting brothers around the super -warrior.As a jail, you see a group of weirds rushing towards you. If you can hold back and not jump up and smash the floor, you have already surpassed 90%of adolescent sports, and in this difficulty 5, you flew out by yourself alone.It means that you will become a waste that cannot be returned to armor. Well, do not talk about the waste occupation of the jail hammer. If your teammates need to stand in the back row to get a shooting vision or avoid teammates from blocking the gunsIf you are in the battle, you will encounter the same problem, and the pioneer must make a choice every time I pick up the enemy: I jump out and cut off the swallowing gun and venom cannibal.The venom burst of the venom that keeps the front is randomly drawn?

First of all I LOVE THIS GAME

BUTT

It has high highs and very low lows

----------WHAT I LOVE AND WOULD KISS THE DEVELOPERS FOR -------------------------------

1. World building ( I never knew what a battlebarge interior looked like and am trying to recreate one in another game so this helps a lot ) ( the little room of a marine )

2. Graphics

3. Space marine lines, interactions, roasts, voice actors - chefs kiss

4. The random interactions on the ship ( Relationship between serfs, marines, techpriests and servitors )
As a side-note, there was an interaction where a servitor reported severe spine injury and that did describe the horror of a servitor)

5. Gaunts dying from the psychic blast when a warrior dies is PERFECTION.

6. Marine movement, weapon sounds, all great

7. The way you can find random areas with weapons or dataslates.

8. Fisting flowers ( Imperial fist reference?)



----------What I hate, dislike, am confused about ( I may be wrong, I accept that, so feel free to discuss with me on this)

1. The armor colors on the customization menu are POOP. Mostly. A lot of colors are missing and some are completely different from the GW colors with the same name. Was it hard to sample bucket those colors from the GW website? AND WHY ARE THERE SO FEW?

2. The eliminator sniper seems way to weak compared to the tabletop

3. The pyroblaster flame looks terrible, range way to short

4. If a unit makes a special attack you cant react with a grenade or some other things, Titus stays there like a brain damaged guardsmen.

5. The way they made the tyrannid rippers is terrible. They are just floating 3D models that are not actually there like the rest of the units and for some reason are not affected by the psychic blast when a warrior dies.

6. The leman russes I saw never move their sponson weapons or USE THEM.

7. The game loads so slow I can take a nap in the meantime.

8. I had a heavy bolter with some rounds left, then I started fighting the LICTOR and I no longer had the weapon, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I was using that.

9. The cutscenes are premade and it does not matter what loadout you selected, it always shows one weapon. A BIT LAZY

10. The enemy variety seems poor, when you see how many units tyrannids actually have. Many of them could be bosses. ( I write this not having finished the game yet so I may eat my words later on)



----------What I wanted but did not get, maybe for now --------------------

1. Letting me play the campaign with custom colors and armor. LET ME PRETEND I AM FIGHTING WITH MY HOMEBREW ARMY. PLEASE!!!

2. Did not see a way to apply custom chapter badges ( homebrew reasons as well )


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- NEW REVIEW AFTER I FINISHED THE MAIN CAMPAIGN --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

WHAT I AM MOST DISAPPOINTED

1. The campaign is way too short, took me 2 days to finish

2. The tyrannid enemies and variety is VERY LACKING
WHAT YOU GET - Rippers, Gaunts, Warriors, Lictor, Carnifexes, spore mines, Harpy, Raveners, Zoanthropes

WHAT YOU DID NOT GET - Bio-Titans, Genestealer, Hive guards, Mawlock, Pyrovores or Biovores, Tervigones, Tyranofexes, Venomthropes

3. Sometimes the guard units just stop and wait for the player to move to the next area, like in poor designed games when the animation just finishes and nothing more happens ( more specifically the bridge section )

4. Random lore aspects that don't make sense like the tyrannids collecting corpses but there are no reclamation pools or tendrils OR having both first-born vehicle models and primaris models

5. Forcing me to use certain weapons in the latest boss battles, when I was saving some special weapons.

6. Like I said before, Leman Russ tanks not shooting their side weapons at all.

7 . The guardsmen depiction is kinda ♥♥♥♥ in regards to their equipment ( they never use mortars, heavy weapons, sentinels, hellhounds, special weapons AT ALL) ( NOT EVEN A BASILISK BOMBARDMENT )

8. No mission with a usable vehicle, just teases us ( at least implement one with an invictor suit )

9. Most of the game is filled with massive teases ( seeing a baneblade stationary BUT NEVER AFTERWARDS, NEVER IN COMBAT) ( a helldrake that suddenly becomes irrelevant )

10. The fact that I have to unlock colors that are WAY TO FEW and INNACURATE

11. The price of the game when you take into consideration all of its negative aspects


The whole game feels like a cash grab, but with some effort put into it because there are still many pozitive aspects.

If with the next patches they change some things I WILL CHANGE THE REVIEW.

Legendz-Senpai⚜,1,71.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Legendz_Senpai/,"I can confirm that Space Marine 2 is probably the best game in the Warhammer 40k universe ever released so far, especially in 3-player co-op, it's enjoyable and awesome.
the game is really beautiful graphically, the scenario is solid and respects the universe of warhammer 40k very well if you like the universe you will really be served. There is a pretty crazy attention to detail in the game the number of enemies that are displayed by combat is really impressive the same for the enemy and allied units in the distance that you can kill there are many different ways to play the game even if in the end it remains the same thing you have a lot of weapons in melee and at a distance. The animations are so enjoyable the cinematics are really magnificent worthy of a movie. The modus operandi is really nice and allows you to play with your own squad at the same time as the main missions of the campaign (always with 3) which allows you to explore the actions during the campaign a little more. And if you are interested in multiplayer for the moment it is really very nice worthy of the first opus of space marine and the future content that the studio plans to put really gives me good hope (new pve mission, pvp mod, horde mode, new weapons etc ...) In short to be honest I never buy games in advance and even less at 80 € to play them in advance but I must say that I am so impressed by the qualities of the game that I recommend you to play it even if you are not a hardcore fan of warhammer. Many studios should perhaps take Saber Interactive as an example to take time to refine their game (isn't that right ubisoft) then just imagine a real single player game as refined as space marine 2 in the star wars universe. I 100% recommend the game.",2024/9/7,en

The rest of the game is very positive.The combat system makes you want every time and even the imperator would be proud of the graphic because it even runs very smoothly.Interface and audio look very well revised and the German Syncro can be heard from.In my opinion, the absolute highlight is the campaign.I can not criticize absolutely anything because it is a lot of fun and the staging is more than successful.

The design of course fucks, but it was very upset that it was the heresy of Trizch who appears in the game in the universe again.At the end of last year, the magnificent Rogue Trader was already released, in which Tsinchu’s demons were also mostly in the main story.I would like to watch in large games at other chaos.

In general, I am sure that these developers will still fill the game with many content.And if the game is interesting to people, they will support it for several years.But at the exit for the game for 5k wooden, well, too weak and empty.The same Rogue Trader on the release, although he had many bugs and strong distortions in the balance, but content in it was 100+ hours.Yes, and it cost much cheaper.The long -range weapon is all the same in sensations, to use something other than heavy bolts and milly in general.Types of opponents are also extremely few - 5 for tyranids and 4 for chaosites.There are few missions, the tasks on the missions are reduced to pressing the buttons on the terminals.

It also seemed that the soundtrack was not enough for the game.I did not remember a single track playing against the background.As if they specially tried to write music, which would be slightly and as unobtrusive as possible in the ear at the time of dashes for locations.But this is Waha, there should be epic orchestral compositions.As it was in the same Rogue Trader, by the way.

I did not encounter technical problems at all, once only from 20-30 sessions in the operations caught a disconnect, but it was more like a local network problem.

If you think to buy, but in doubt - it is better to wait six months or a year.Then maybe the content will be delivered, and the discounts are drunk.Only completely broken fans of the universe will be able to entertain themselves on a release.

In short, I don’t understand why so many Space Marine 2 are called one of the best games in the universe at the moment.

DanWardog,1,141.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994343052/,"The style of the game is on point with satisfying gameplay, but it has some GLARING issues. I'd recommend it, but I hope it gets some polish soon!

Pros:
Style: The feel of the 40k universe is really hit on the head. This alone has probably gotten me through the game. I just really adore it.
Audio: Crunchy sound design is very satisfying.
Weapons: The gear you use feels pretty good, the design is limited, but it's loyal to the universe.
Gameplay: Fairly rhythmic fighting with parries, counters & dodges.
Big enemies: Boss fights can be tough ( Angel of Death difficulty ), but typically manageable ( caveat below ).
Story: The story is a bit shallow, but good enough.

Cons:
The most glaring issue is ally AI. It's horrendous, pathetically bad. This can make some boss fights an absolute slog when you're trying to balance yourself to proceed through the fight. It also destroys immersion seeing an Astartes knuckle f***ing himself in the corner while you're fighting for your life.
Hit boxes: The hit boxes are bad. You'll get hit at bizarre ranges & you'll often shoot invisible walls when attacking enemies. I've also been struck countless times through cover from ranged attacks.
Homing Melee Attacks: One the most annoying things in this game is enemies leaping at you ( not talking about parry counters ) & having them turn in the air or have them YA YEET themselves after you when you dodge.
Stun Lock: Though I understand it's a swarm hitting you & that's sort of the point, getting stun locked is just a poor choice. No one likes stun lock. No one likes losing control of their character. No one wants to have 2/3 of their health gone from 3 gaunts.

Edit:

Tacked on Feature: After finally playing the PvP I gotta' say it's pretty dog-sh*t. The fact that you have to re-level up just to use weapons is a very brain-dead decision. It's artificial play time that should not exist in a game where PvP feels like a tack-on to begin with. Being dumped into games where the majority of my team is > Level 10 & the opponents are < Level 20 is laughable.

I want to like this game, but I can't recommend it when the first game is better in every way. Saber Interactive clearly has some big fans of the franchise in their midst, but the gameplay needs a lot more time in the oven.

Visually, the game is stunning. If you're a lore enjoyer, you're in for a good time.

The gameplay is passable to bad in the best of times. They attempt to wow you with some cool swarming tech, but once the novelty wears off, you're left with a lot to be desired.

Gunplay is bland and simple while Melee is clunky and unpolished. Hitting enemies feels like hitting a sponge. Dodge and Parry prompts aren't responsive and sometimes simply wont do anything at all. You'll take 3/4 of your health in damage for failing a prompt. Better hope someone on your team is killing the ranged enemies or that failed prompt will end with you dying while your character tries to stand up.

When an enemy's health gets low enough, they're stunned and prompt you to run over and Execute them with a special animation. When executed, you'll restore armor (not health). This would be great if smaller enemies didn't die in one hit, preventing you from executing them for armor. Don't forget that you're getting hit for a majority of your health, so, good luck! Sometimes it feels like it's is more efficient to recover health/armor by dying and letting your AI companions resurrect you. The overall flow of battle feels terrible when you're supposed to be a walking tank.

PUFF,1,78.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yanDeiya123/,"Game evaluation is currently recommended: for hammer powder and players who are interested in art.
It is even not as good as dark.
There are a few very big questions, I hope you know before the 9th tour.
1. The guns cannot be interrupted instructions, and they are not completely invincible. Under the difficulty of difficulty, the high blood elite cannot be directly taken off, so I still recommend melee execution.
2. There are bugs in some maps. The wizards that have not been killed in the last scene (last stage) will resurrect the thousands across the map, resulting in the game that is almost impossible.
3. There are two sections of the block, and the second paragraph is a push, but the push is not blocked, and the resistance of the blocking itself is not strong, and the situation of the mixed tide or plural elite cannot be supported.
4. Instructions In addition to being executed and blocking interruption, the rolling roll cannot be interrupted, which means that you must end the last action if you want to roll.As a result, the weapon with a large action frame like Thunder Hammer suffers.
5. There is no nanny at present in this game. The battle returns to the battle is relatively strict. There are three cases. One is that the shield will be opened next to you.Execute immediately.So the full shield should be given to the teammates to the teammates.
6. High difficulty remote survivability is insufficient, and it is difficult to balance the surrounding and miscellaneous and handled elites.At present, both the two mains have problems, which are mainly reflected in the treatment of the elites too slowly, and it is difficult to deal with Licat and snake worms without teammates.
7. In terms of mechanism, the role of the shield is actually connected. There are shield-clear mixed/injury-no shield-execution cycle to maintain the battle rhythm, but once it is stuck to the shield for a minute by remote melee.

This latest installment in the Warhammer 40K universe sets a new standard for action-packed shooters with its impeccable blend of brutal melee combat, strategic gunplay, and stunning visuals. Saber Interactive really came through with this installment. It is a game that long time fans of Warhammer 40k truly have been asking for.

From the moment you step into the power armor of a Space Marine, the game impresses with its attention to detail. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking paired with a bombastic audio design, Space Marine 2 showcases the grimdark universe with a level of realism that immerses you completely. The environments are richly detailed, from the war-torn landscapes to the imposing architecture of the Imperium’s strongholds.

The combat is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The gameplay feels both fluid and weighty, with a seamless transition between hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry. The abilities and upgrades add depth and variety, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and exhilarating. The game’s AI is notably sharp, presenting a formidable challenge that keeps you on your toes without ever feeling unfair.

Narratively, the game excels in delivering a compelling story set against the backdrop of a galaxy in turmoil. The voice acting and script are top-notch, with a storyline that feels both epic and personal. The character development is rich, and the dialogue manages to balance gravitas with moments of dark humor, adding layers to the experience.

Multiplayer has a offering of diverse modes and a progression system that keeps the action engaging and competitive. Whether you’re battling in co-op missions or competing in PvP, the multiplayer experience is both rewarding and addictive. Looking forward to see what Saber Interactive does with future content.

In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a masterclass in combining thrilling gameplay with a deep, immersive world. It’s a must-play for fans of the franchise and a standout entry for those new to the universe. This game not only meets but exceeds expectations, proving itself as a benchmark in the genre.

Craftless Rogue,1,12.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Revendawn/,"My Dearest Martha,

I write this letter having been beset by Tyranid scum and Chaos villainy. I have finished the main campaign with my AI brothers and there is much to say.

They say war is hell and while that is true here it is a very pretty hell. The sights and sounds of battle are massive in scale and in quality. Watching enemies explode into bloody bits or some magical dust ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was always satisfying. While most of my time was spent with two other squad mates there was always a feeling of a larger campaign at play. Sometimes from background battles raging, but also in those moments when you are charging forward alongside a massive army.

The spectacle is really incredible and I found, in general, the combat to be fun. Guns felt like that had impact and ""oomph"" melee weapons had weight. It felt good to run around, see the sights, and fight. All the pieces make for an extremely compelling experience that I couldn't walk away from, even if occasional issues would cause the odd rage-quit.

So let's talk about the bad stuff, because this has not been all roses. For every time you get a jump pack and the game gets 100x more fun there are a few things and missions that bring the overall experience down.

First off - this game is clearly a multiplayer/COOP game first. The AI squad is awful. They get the most important part right, which is trying to revive you if you go down, but beyond that they are poor in combat, and almost non-existent when it comes to objectives or tactics. Now it's okay to make a game where you want COOP as a focus, but if you are going to advertise and push that it's a solo game too you do need to properly support that experience and I think the game falls incredibly short in this key area.

In fact I think that if you had a better, more effective, and/or commandable squad the other issues I have might not matter. I also felt that for a giant armored Space Marine I felt like dolled up tissue paper. The game asks a lot in terms of special blocks, regular blocks, special dodges, regular dodges, pistol counters, executions, ranged fighting, and melee swarms all at once, but gives very little health and armor to support all of that even on the baseline difficulties. It doesn't make the game impossible by any means, but it does make it a little less fun.

Still I can't help but think that much of this is less of an issue if my squad was doing a better job of not making me fight everything mostly alone possibly while juggling objectives and in one really bad stage while also using a flamethrower to keep swarms at bay.

While I've focused on issues a bit I think overall my net experience with the game is far more better moments than troubled ones. There was only one stage I hated (the swarm bunker thing) and a few objectives that made me long for less brain-dead brothers at my side. It didn't prevent me from completing the campaign over a few days because I couldn't stop playing. They are also all issues that can be fixed.

So often we see games come out with problems way beyond the scope of a patch, but in the case of Space Marine 2 I don't think there is anything that couldn't be improved down the line. Hopefully they actually make some of these improvements, because I think this game could be damn-near perfect if they did.

Also as these issues are almost all tied to the single player experience, if you are playing online or with friends I think realistically you are just going to have a much better time. So it's an easy recommend to online/COOP players and while I still recommend it to solo player I do warn that there are some pain points, especially on higher difficulties from your AI companions.

At a time where my gaming has been an hour here, an hour there, try this, try that, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 became my world for a few days. Despite the blood and carnage of it all it was a glorious focus and a stellar time.

For the Emperor,

For normal people, the game looks very well graphically, the worst are the characters, who look good, but it does not reach the phostorealism of the stages, in terms of performance, I am not playing everything up/ultra less the textures, because it asks me for more than 8 GB of video RAM to use texture in ultra.I have used DLSS and I get an average of frames over 60 to 2K, which seems very well optimized, and does not usually fall when they carry hundreds of enemies on screen.I find this game with World War Z, in terms of mechanics and difficulty, for me it is not an easy game, just like WWZ you need to improve your team a lot to survive the waves, but just left and everythingThis will be subject to changes.In a good game, to relax a few hours a day, massacring enemies brutally, but if you want to be hooked for many hours, in my case I get tired of me, that is, perfect to play a few hours a day, but from 2 or 3hours, it can be heavy that day, but the next day you enjoy it again as a child.Despite the campaign, and the PVE game modes are necessaryThey will continue to take new content, but today, for me, I see it scarce, the game consists of repeating and repeating until you get the best scores, times and with the greatest difficulty.

For Warhammer fans, with all customization options as a scheme of colors, ornaments, badges, you will spend hours designing your favorite space sailor, your own chapter and even if you throw your own character imagination.And in photo mode, it is as if you had its Warhammer table game on your screen, the whole atmosphere takes you to the mad and dystopian future of W40K.

In summary, the game is fun, the extra cosmetic content I only see it necessary if you are a fan of the W40K and you can afford the fuck that is worth every nonsense.For a person who does not know W40K, it may seem expensive or little content, and that there are other better games, for tastes, I just hope I have helped you with this review.Of all motorcycles if you are not sure, wait for the demo or see gameplay videos on YouTube or streaming, now one thing, the video codec does not do justice to how the game is seen on your screen.

Note: The game uses servers for progress and multiplayer modes, but according to Roadmap, you can create a private and offline server, and you should upload experience, or at least in offline mode as WWZ occurs (this is in the air, we will see to seeAs they do at the end), you can play perfectly without internet connection in disconnected mode, or simply without internet connection.The only thing you do not advance in experience to your characters, therefore you do not unlock, improvements, cosmetics, etc,

As a clarification in WWZ, which has two modes the online that has its own level of progress, and the offline, that is, if I play online, and I carry at level 10, in the offline I follow at level 0 or vice versa.I like it that way because I always do not want to play with unknown people, and I simply fancy macharcar tyrannates to my ball quietly without the subnormal on duty being shooting me to run (this is already true, and yes, there is a friend fire).",2024/9/7,es

Swinging in the mobs is simply impossible. It is recommended that mobs directly.Spray it with hot melting and then concentrate on handling the elite monsters.

The environments are very well designed and the graphics engine does an admirable job of bringing large hordes of enemies to life. The art team clearly loved this game and the wealth of visual inspiration found in the 40k universe makes for an environment that's consistently grimdark and occasionally breathtaking despite the dark, oppressive story beats.

However, the gameplay is too basic to remain entertaining for long. Melee is a one-button affair with a push-X-to-parry system that wants to draw comparisons to Arkham Knights but feels more like a ""push X to not die"" scene from a mid-2000s action game. You do not dictate the pace of combat and any aggression on your part is immediately punished with chip damage from ranged fire and minor foes on your flanks. That chip damage swiftly mounts into fatalities. You -must- parry and retaliate, exploiting the invulnerability allowed by the retaliation and execution animations to restore your armor, slowly wearing down swarms of foes at a pace that is simply out of character for Space Marines.

Guns are inaccurate unless you're aiming down sights, ammunition is sharply limited, and anything worth shooting is also either resilient enough to shrug off ranged fire or capable of blocking sniper rounds with a sword. If an ally engages an enemy you can pop off a few head shots to knock it into execution range, but for the most part you're better off wading into the melee horde yourself and tediously retaliating your way to victory.

The visual character customization is beautiful but harshly restricted and/or greedily monetized, the equipment specialization and character growth are slow and ineffectual until you get one of a the handful of major abilities scattered throughout a 25 level grind. Relics and other equipment make more of a difference visually than in combat effectiveness - an additional 10% damage doesn't take you from 6 heavy attacks to 5 to stun a warrior, but the max rank sword sure does look a little prettier than the starter sword.

To cap that all off, in multiplayer every player has to play as a different class - but you can't select your class and then queue into a team where you're not competing for that class spot. There's about a 1 in 3 chance that someone has already selected the class you want to play when you join a team, and you can't progress your class if you can't play it, so expect to have to leave and re-queue, sometimes multiple times in a row, in order to play a preferred class in multiplayer.

The final nail in the coffin, then, is that despite the shallowness of the gameplay and the general jank of the multiplayer system, this game is terribly short, confusingly lacking in content despite having so little depth. There are only six campaign missions, which have no replayability. The only other option for PvE are operations, but again, there are only six operations. This is a full-priced $60 game that you could finish in a day, that nonetheless expects you to grind out 48 mission completions with each class to unlock visual armor.",2024/9/7,en

IF YOU SUFFER FROM MOTION SICKNESS THIS MIGHT NOT BE YOUR GAME.
if you DO NOT suffer from motion sickness then this game is metal af. buy it lol.

the narrow fov with no adjustability is the only deal breaking issue i have with the game. i dont wanna give the game a bad review because the other aspects of the game are great, BUT its basically unplayable for me.
i can only play for about 2 hours on my desktop setup before i had stop because i was becoming physically ill.

However playing on my htpc setup with a 50” tv several feet away is tolerable.

in 2024, an fov slider is a basic QOL option for most people and for some (like me) is a legit accessibility option that makes the game playable.
not having an fov slider is like not having subtitles for the hearing impaired.

IF an fov slider is added i will update my review to positive cause the rest of the game is alot of fun

It would be a 10/10 Emperor mandated purchase but there were a few gamebreaking bugs that me and my friend encountered during our playthrough that made us have to restart several times.

The pvp is skill based and requires you to move as a unit like OG halo multiplayer and the movement feels a lot like gears of war minus the cover to cover aspect of moving in that game.

The Campaign immediately entered my top 5 best campaigns along with Halo and Last of Us. The final missions is pure unfiltered fan service and I couldn't get enough of it.

The Scenarios are also awesome and provide a good bit of replay-ability with the perks and cosmetic unlocks and each class feels powerful in their own right.

One of my personal favorite things in this game has to be NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS!!!

The Bulldozer,1,20.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198372793657/,"I really hate to do this so early on, but out of my alleged 2 hours of ""playtime"", only 20-30 minutes has actually been in control of a Space Marine. I'm not joking when I say I've simply started scrolling through twitter and watching whole YouTube videos whilst waiting for things to load, and it also turns out that despite having downloaded the game for no less than 4 hours, I am SOMEHOW missing some ""Epic Games Multiplayer Files"". For some reason, loading into the Campaign requires connecting to a server, and basically every single cut-scene has either frozen itself partway through, has had such delayed audio that it's genuinely confusing as to who's saying what unless you have Subtitles on, or flat out just crashes the game. That half an hour I've actually been able to play the game was fun, I admit, but that simply does NOT excuse how everything outside of the gameplay seems to have been handled.

Oh, and on a separate note, a friend of mine from the UK wanted me to gift this for them when it released today and I couldn't due to ""Regional Price differences"". Turns out that people in the UK are paying what is effectively an extra $12 in USD for this game compared to Americans, so please do note that if you are from that region across the big pond.

My 2024 Goty

Man game, pure testosterone, made for who is a fan of Warhammer.It will take tears out of your eyes, finally we arrived at AAA and deserve this place.

Fast and responsive combat, Gore on display, gives you a feeling of being a super soldier.If you want Power Fantasy's appearance, play the easiest, because in the last two difficulties Titus is made of paper, and you have to be smart and see the fight as something more tactical.

Melee combat weapons are extremely strong, which makes the various bolters of the game support weapons.The hammer is the last melee combat weapon to be unlocked and is fantastic to deal with any enemy, even the bosses that will be in their way.As it was in the first game, carrying a weapon of loud damage, like a sniper, and the hammer for the rest.

Unlike the first game, Titus's ""Rage"" doesn't help you much, at least in the highest difficulties.Using Rage in the middle of a lot of enemies won't heal you anything, you have to have a vision of when you use it to fill your life bar.The game has two life systems: HP, which can only be healed with Rage and Medpacks scattered on the map (at most, you will find 4 by level, and they don't even recover their entire lives, they recover about 40% of your total life), and the armor, which will be your real life, being recovered over time or with executions in enemies.Rarely you will perform a weak enemy, it reserves the elites.The game becomes a samba where you kill hundreds of basic mobs while focusing on putting the elite in a state of execution to stay alive within the combat.

Positioning is master against both and against, but the insect hordes offer a much greater challenge than them.These damn insects will surround you both closely and far, with grenades that obstruct your way and pests that will make your vision blurred.Wizards are masters in long -range combat, but Marines are not as dangerous as cultists with snipers rifles, who together destroy their lives and put me on the ground several times.

Beautiful cutscenes, basic history, but invokes all that Warhammer represents with the overseas, angels of the empire of man, who come when the empire most needs to save the day.

Even though I'm not a fan of overseas, I really liked their characterization.Congratulations to know.",2024/9/8,pt

The entire theatre is much more ""alive"" than before, very often you will fight side by side with the guard, see wonderfully made models of tanks and listen to rousing speeches by devout soldiers of the Emperor.
The atmosphere is top notch, how everything sounds too and executes look nice again.

The campaign is very well done and fun to play, with GREAT surprises and events that are really cool.
Seeing the swarms of Tyranids on the screen is astonishing.

There is a problem with playing the campaign solo tho.
It is entirely possible to play the campaign on Veteran, solo, but for a first time playthrough i highly recommend against it.

I assume they balanced the Veteran campaign around at least 2 humans playing, which is tremendous fun for sure,
but solo quite some things are not difficult, just frustratingly stupid because the AI is very limited.
I can imagine double Zoanthropes are much less of a hassle, even on vet, with at least 2 ""real"" players.
The ranged damage received is through the roof too, which could be a numbers problem,
or because the ai has such poor target priority.

I have a Keyboard issue where my current input is being shut off randomly.
It happens when i walk/run or zoom in to aim. The character stops in his tracks / no longer zooms in until i press the button again and its making it very difficult to enjoy the game. It happens during fights, it happens when i have to walk somewhere.

Its NOT my keyboard, it works perfectly fine with other games, including Space Marine which i re-played tuesday and wednesday. Its only this game.


If you like 40k, Space Marines and good action buy this game and if you are on the fence about it, maybe wait for the first sale.

Space Marine 2 offers action and slaughter in abundance.If you enjoy hack & slay, you will love this game.
The gameplay in the campaign is appealing and challenging.The control with a mouse or gamepad works perfectly and it will never be boring to dismember its enemies in beautiful graphics.
Unfortunately, you have to say that there are still a few technical defects.For example, the game always crashes when I want to end it.
There is also no manual storage function.Unfortunately, the game only saves automatically, on certain checkpoints.
Likewise, the lack of a 21: 9 or 32: 9 support, prevents an even higher assessment on my part.

Therefore I would currently give a 7.5/10.

And finally - a full cooperative for three people.This is a worthy receiver SM1, personally I stick in cm2 with a high and stuck for sure.And Saber has long established themselves as masters of their craft, for Timeshift - the game of my childhood, was ultra of the soldered.Like Will Rock, like World War Z. Therefore, if you have problems with the game, I am sure that they will be corrected.But it’s better not to play in cm2 if you don’t have a 6 GB video card or more.

Well, in general, this is the only contender for the game of the year.This year, in fact, except Mullet Madjack, Alone in the Dark, Hellblade 2 and Hades 2 came out either ramics, or HELLDIVERS 2 which turned into feces, or frank feces.The only one who can really compete with Space Marine 2 is Hmrih2 in October.And that’s all, stupidly without competitors, for the year mega went rotten for the year.But okay, we don’t wait but get ready.

I felt the game completely, I went to the veteran.A veteran is an imbalance complexity, but it was passable, it took me 8 hours to pass.In the cooperative, play plus minus as in solo, but in the operation mode, the coop drags.The multiplayer also has a good, purely classic game, without any jokes except skins + games go quickly (from 5 to 15 minutes).In general, Kaif Shuther, for a long time did not play such a peppy and extinguishing action.But of course, against the background of Vermintide 1-2, I like less, because not a 40k fan.

""

The Kingdom of Ultramar, also known as the subseector of Ultramar, is the feudal star empire as part of the Imperium of mankind in the segment of Ultim.The Order of Adeptus Astartes Ultramarins runs here, and the head of this empire is the master of the Order, which bears the title of Bishop Macragga and Vladyka Ultramar.

A distinctive feature of the subsector is a strong friendship between the local population and the orders of the XIII Legion.During the Great Crusade, the native world of the Legion of the Ulgon, Macragg, supplied the XIII legion with recruits and equipment.After the end of the terrible events of Horus heresy, candidates began to recruit from all worlds of the small empire.This space is ultramar, the star kingdom of ultramarins.

Ultramarins - XIII of the original twenty legions of the cosmodesant.Now one of the most famous orders of adeptus Astartes.

The Ultramarino Legion waged the emperor’s wars with the help of judgment, discipline and determination;Each warrior sought to imitate his primarch in everything.This most numerous of all the legions of the cosmodesant was a longtime defender of the possessions of the Imperium in the Galactic East.

The strategic preferences noticed: a universal attack, a focused extermination, planetary blockade, operations to free and bring to submission to the limited theater of military operations. Buckets immensely devoted to their primarch Robaut Gilliman, ultramarines blindly follow the Astartes Code.Ten thousand years they fought as described on the pages of this scripture.Other orders can easily tear out the words of Gilliman from the context and adjust to themselves, but not ultramarins.The Astartes Code is the work of great wisdom, and these warriors do not see the point of arguing to it.Unreasonable examples of self -sacrifice and self -discipline allowed the inhabitants of ultramar to carry sacred knowledge and faith through ten thousand years to the future.

The Astartes Code contains hundreds of description pages for any conceivable tactical situation on the battlefield and many options for solving the problem.Each warrior of the Order memorizes the content of the Code by heart, so that a whole company acts as a single organism.The wisdom of millions of imperial generals, soldiers and officers is concentrated on the pages of the Astartes Code, in it a warrior can find everything: from heraldry and insignia, to the instructions for planetary assault.

Contra:
Short story (6 missions that are about 1 hour), no widescreen support (changes soon), first only 6 pvvet missions (again about 45-1h long and in themselves they also belong to the story this yearCome according to Roadmap) If you are also a FPS-Ho3 you need Lossless Scaling (unless you have a 3070+), relatively repetitive without horde mode, cross play still leads to long loading times, servers are not yet perfect

I've been waiting for a long time since last year, and I decided to buy it if the early evaluation was not smashed.
GTX 3070 QHD Game Automatic Settings, Balanced Mode, 60 ~ 80 frames, so the optimization is well optimized.

The game is getting harder as the games that come out these days, and there are many situations where you need to study the game to play the game on a wide open world, numerous gimmicks, and complex skill trees.

Torn, uh, feet, long!

The combat style is close to 7 ranged 3 ratio, with a long -range battle and a ranged feeling.This is because the maintenance will increase only when the short -range paring is recovered to the advantage and execution.

It is not burdensome for beginners because they tell the screen of paring timing and not guard avoidance timing.It's been a long time since I sliced, defeated, shoots, and torn as it was.In particular, when the boss attacks are continuously paralleled, and when they break the casserole with a gap shot, they make the illusion of becoming a soul petrogant.

Kriev,1,76.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kriev/,"Brothers, this game stands as a beacon of the Emperor’s might, a war hymn to His eternal glory.

The campaign of Space Marine 2 is pure cinema, peak masculinity, but in the raw, honorable sense, not the forced ""feelings"" of modern (S o n y) entertainment. It is a worthy successor to the original Space Marine staying true to the true Warhammer 40k spirit, from the grimdark aesthetics and sharp dialogue to the visceral combat and unforgettable catchphrases, this game is steeped in the essence of the 40k universe. It definitively passes the vibe check.

There is no weakness here, no false sentiment, only the unyielding strength of the Adeptus Astartes. This is no charade of emotion from the weakling masses of modern Terra.

This sequel does honor to its predecessor, as any true son of Guilliman honors the gene-seed of his primarch. The game is the very essence of the 40k made manifest.

While fighting through Tyranid swarms, you witness Cadian squadrons holding the line against an unending tide of enemies. These moments offer a powerful sense of scale, while you may be the protagonist, you're just one cog in the massive war machine of the Imperium. The game does an excellent job showcasing the Imperium’s many parts, from the Astra Militarum and their discipline shouting Cadia stands while being charge by a swarm of gaunts, the Admech with their arrogance, disdain for the flesh and their many rituals to please the Machine Spirit to the zealous and fanatic Ecclesiarchy and, of course, the ever-present bureaucratic nightmare of the Administratum.

On the performance side, Space Marine 2 handles remarkably well, even when the screen is full with enemies and chaos. The fluidity helps maintain immersion, ensuring that you never lose sight of the epic scale and intensity of the battles and the scale of the conflict.

The companion AI, while functional, can be a bit off sometimes, often leaving enemies stunned without finishing them off. If you're not there to clean up after them, those enemies will recover and come back into the fight.

The co-op features are well-implemented, allowing you to seamlessly join your friends sessions via Steam or using an invite code. While playing with random players works fine, there are occasional slowdowns due to the lengthy loading screens when joining or leaving sessions. This could definitely be better as it can get a bit annoying.

If you don't know Warhammer 40k, you'll understand that you are doing somehow, but you often don't know what you're saying.
It is a thick story with more than 40 years of history, so it may be inevitable to some extent, but I thought it would be nice to have a glossary at least.

Story mode can be cleared in a little 10 hours
Regarding the battle, I felt that it was TPS, but the proximity was the main than shooting.
In the game video PV, etc., the small fish enemies that appear, but the slightly strong enemy that springs on the road will reduce the stiffness of Parry, or if you do not avoid it, you can clear it just by hitting the attack button repeatedly.Note that it is not sex.

There are two types of coops, the main story can be cooperated, but it is a mode of the main character Titus and other ultramarine characters, making it a mode with no customization.
There is an operation mode from a soldier viewpoint that is active behind the main story.
Operation mode is created by original space marine, the role of each class, weapon growth, and the mode with parks, so it is necessary to clear the main story stage to play the operations mode, so immediately after purchase.Playing operations mode is virtually impossible.

In the creation of the original space marine, some decals of the successor fighter were also well prepared, so it was good to be able to select colors based on the Citadel color basis, but it is possible to determine the color for each part or decal.Due to the customizability, it seems that there is no way to create a corps that only paint fist like Crimson Fist, and we are looking forward to improving it in the future.


★ Good setting to know before playing this work.(No explanation in the work)
Q. What is Space Marine?What is the emperor?
A. The emperor was suffering from various troubles when human beings entered the universe, but the emperor was saved as a leader.
Furthermore, the emperor uses the gene of the emperor to create an Android.
The existence born in that way is the primary space marine ""primark (general)""
The 20 born primarks are scattered in space in the work of the evil gods living in a different world, ""Keos"" (the gods of chaos), in a childcare capsule.
The primarks are scattered, but the emperor creates a space marine based on the primark gene.
The emperor will re -meet with the scattered primarks that have grown on various planets, led by the created Space Marine Army to unify the galaxy.

Q. Why are you fighting between the same space marine?
A. Each reunited primarks with characteristics as the leader as the leader, creating a corps, and it seemed that the unification of the galaxy was going well due to the space marine, but the chaos (chaos gods) suggested Horus, one of the primarks.A large -scale civil war occurs.
Here, nine Emperor's loyalty and nine major reversal of Horus, who rebelled against the emperor, are divided.(Of the 20 people, the remaining two are erased from the record)
Known as Horus Helethy (10,000 years ago, it is also called 30k)
Horus was defeated, and other major reversal space marine fled to distortion (warp), but the fatal emperor became a plant human.
Even if it reached 40k, the great reversal, who fled to distortion, continues to fight as Keos Space Marine receiving blessing from the gods of chaos.
Space Marine Everyone Brother!Death to the heretics of the traitor!

Q. What is Zeno?
A. One of them is the enemy Terranid of this work of a different orientation
There are other orks, tauen pirates, necrons, etc.

Q. What is Robut Gilliman?
A. Space marine protemark with blue armor marked with Ω in the opposite direction
Space Marine should be like this!Those who made the ""Scriptures of Battle"" with such contents

Q. What is Cadian?
A. About the people of the planet Cadia

Although the campaign is a little short and may be expanded in the future with one or two expansions you have to say that Warhammer has really delivered 40,000: Space Marine 2 in all other matters.The campaign can hardly be surpassed in bombast, the graphic performance is really optimally staged and very often lets you be amazed with an open mouth.

The co-op missions are also a lot of fun and tell the history of the other group alongside Captain Titus and his team.

The character development is separated in the co-op missions and the multiplayer and lets a lot of scope to create his desired marine (or an existing chapter).

The multiplayer is just beautiful accessories like the first part back then and can also be fun if you play with the right people.But even as in the first part, the variety of tickets is not big, the hitRregistration is not really the best and it can quickly become monotonous.

It must be said that the need for optimization is still required at the present time.The game is Strak CPU-heavy and many CPUs, especially Intel 13/14 generation run very hot with this title and are very happy to reach your limit.Good cooling should already be available until it was reworked.Undervolting should be almost mandatory in these generations.Otherwise the game is almost bug -free and runs really well.

Gameplain game is an action from a third person with all the ensuing.We get the task and go cut the path from point A to point B. Here I note, the locations are ideologically “corridor”, but the developer tried and gave the most diversity in the fresh air and at least wandering in the dull corridors of the plants (but where without it).On the periphery, something explodes periodically, breaks and a different motion occurs, in every possible way emphasizing the scale of what is happening.The benefit of the schedule did not disappoint and everything looks great, helping immersion in what is happening on the monitor screen.The arsenal for bringing to agreement will definitely not amaze your imagination, but you can find something cut, automatic or semi -automatic you can find it without difficulty.

Management is normal, there are simple combo for cold weapons, tags on enemies about a blocked \ non -blocked attack.Everything is fine, but only until the moment when the attacking mobs becomes very many, everything risks merging into porridge and forces to make constant somersaults.He himself went through the game in Solo, on the Veteran and periodically met the moments where the game did not allow to take a break, in Pati it would not be relevant.Boodles help a little on the battlefield, but you should not lay strong hopes on them.In general, if you do not plan to attract comrades to the passage, they are not worthless to stuffiness and just want to relax, then the first two options of difficulties will be the best choice.

I also note the local PVE mission coop - ""battle"".They become accessible gradually, as they pass through the plot, slightly supplementing the main branch of the actions of GG.Choose the attracted class of the space marineer, weapons, the level of complexity and go to shred all living things with two more comrades or random players.Very cheerfully played at the first acquaintances with locations.In parallel, the local currency, the experience and level, which are necessary for changing the appearance of the online character, the appearance of weapons and pumping of the peak tree, are farm there.In a word - Grind.

There is also a PVP of battles, but this is already for an amateur.The passage of this regime will not affect the impression of the game.

The plot here is simple and unpretentious, we are standardly trying to prevent a disaster, but it turns out that not everything is so simple and some hidden forces can be involved here.Just right, so that the player is not overloaded with information against the background of what is happening on the screen.The passage time will vary around 8-9 hours.

As a result, this project is not perfect and, if desired, you can get minuses and shortcomings, but there are no perfect games.Here, an exciting company allowing you to visit three worlds and feel like a brutal space marineer who is overcoming everything in the world goes to his goal.And the visual component helps to better feel this immersion.Saber's domestic developers did a great job.I am sure that this project was worth impressive forces and nerves ... and they coped.

Ravn,0,25.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119673699/,"Preface before reading, I don't want the game to fail I just think it won't succeed without the heed of criticism. I never write reviews, but this game is being overly praised while being seriously flawed.

Pros:

- Great writing true to the warhammer universe.

- They included many chapters and their heraldry with a great framework to expand upon.

- Everything visually looks wonderful and grim in the best way possible. Not too taxing on my gpu or cpu.
(NVIDIA rtx 3070 ti, intel i9-12900K)

- Similarities and nods to the previous space marine game in the series.

- Audio sounds 'okay' except for the voice act which is superb.

- A fair amount of attention to detail throughout the game which is very nice to see.

Cons:

-Connectivity, nothing more must be said just look at the other reviews.

- Multiplayer being the main staying power of the game feels like an after thought and not fully thought through before implementing it. Of course not everyone cares about the multiplayer, but I see it as what would increase the longevity of the game.

- The melee system overall is very weak, especially in multiplayer. Parrying an enemy doesn't stun or hamper the other player in anyway in multiplayer. You can just wail on them until you when but even that is flawed because you are better off just using your bolter to win melee fights. The firearms do significantly more effective damage and don't lock you in a terrible animation. No aim punch or stagger from melee means closing the distance as a play still is dead, you should just play tactical or heavy every match. Locking your enemy into melee is a decided strategy and is not present.

- Getting kills in multiplayer is extremely underwhelming resulting in both the victor and the defeated just feeling frustrated. It would be rewarding if they care over the execute system from the campaign, maybe give you invincibility frames or just expedite the animation time to leave it for when you have opening for the time it would take.

- It's hard to tell when you are being hit, possible adding armor shift under fire or some sort of light stagger would fix that.

- Hitting enemies doesn't feel nearly as impactful as similar games and for a super human clad in metal. The bolter variants do appropriate damage but it doesn't feel like you are shooting anyone. Maybe this is the SFX department but it just feels a bit hollow.

- Biggest problem with the campaign that I experienced was enemies shooting my teammates and me through the world terrain or cargo containers, anything really it just seemed the ranged enemies could hit you from anywhere through anything. A problem with the engine or the assets I'm not sure, hopefully this gets fixed.

- No friendly fire seems like a mistake, I get its more casual friendly but I believe it does a great deal of immersive damage and also unbalances multiplayer. I can stack grenades on top of melee fights with my teammates just killing the enemy team and also it does damage yourself with some like the shock grenade.

- The physics system needs some work non-static items seem to be near weightless.

- So many great opportunities for fresh game modes but nope they went with the tried and true which is fine. Hopefully they get a little creative with the upcoming modes and maybe pull some ideas from the tabletop.

- A cover system seems not necessary, but would improve the combat immersively and tactically.

Conclusion:

The basics are there but it needs a lot of work, balancing, and straight up system changes. Sadly as a warhammer fan I would have to recommend against purchasing until the game gets some major polishing and a few changes to the core. Multiplayer could be a gem for this game.

Good job to the team so far, sorry for all the critique, good luck with the rest of development.",2024/9/8,en

It's a puppet.
My plague 3300h can TS, the dark tide 700h golden storm.If you feel that the above data can not represent the understanding of the game itself and the technical perspective, it should be that I am not loyal enough
Plot
The plot is about 7-8h (it is worth praising). However, as the front plot of the PVE game, there is no character reward, but it is divided into 4 difficulty.Because when the characters do not have the ability to point the weapon and no skill points, the nightmare begins->

Start the game that is the default Tyrannosaurus clause: The EPIC online service is bound to the default. You must download it first to play. Needless to say more with EPIC compatibility.At that time, you thought it was a bit of an exclusive to EPIC. As a result, STEAM is now doing this?Speaking of wwz, this game screen is like the wwz that changes the skin. It is quite impressed, but the weapon strike feedback is really as soft as WWZ. The dark tide next door can really throw him a few streets.The quality of the weapon is divided into white -green and purple gold. There are different types of weapons under each quality. You can upgrade with experience. The weapon upgrade can have skill points. The weapon can directly feed the material full level.In other words, if you play 5 can be full of quality experience and weapon experience. As a result, although the weapon is full, you still have to play 5 to gain quality experience. The quality does not rise to the next level.Where is the significance of weapons?IntersectionWhen you play N3, you will get stuck when you get the purple drawings, because you will find that the weapon cannot rise without the level and there are more skill points and attacks.Go, the mobs touched a grid, and the Tan Gang's pottery Astart was as fragile as wearing a newspaper. Some occupations were only two squares., Especially chaos, the painful people can stop the position directly, spray fires and shoot, and play you like a kite. You and him are scratching like boots and it is strange.The weapon is to attack the trick to attack the trick, and when you think you can cut it, you will give you a QTE to interrupt the rhythm of your operation.I don't know what type of this is between, and each point cannot be reached.Now there are only a hot -melt gun, but only three occupations are available, and because there is a blood back blood BUG, ​​it can continue with survival.
Regarding the problem of network cards and matching, it is recommended that you look at your own network or accelerator. There is no server in Steam games in China. Non-P2P online requires that accelerators are common sense. Opening a accelerator 7-80 delay will not card at all.As for the refusal to report an error, it is not clear that I have never encountered it.

This is even more heavy. It may be due to the lack of WWZ content, so it has added the PVP mode to extend the game time, but a PVP has 200 points for win!A person is only 1 point, even if you shoot a shot one in a second.Yes, yes, there will be no day.You can also guess your nationality.It also added PVP content to achievement, and the skin obtained in the future does not know if it will be obtained from PVP.

If you think it is caused by my dishes, please take a look at the original words of the famous big guy AVP2: 1) Weapon imbalance and fewer weapons; 2) The basic logic of melee is problematic, and the income and risks are not proportional (Except for the play of individual close -up mechanisms, such as playing against the shield guard, but this play is very single); 3) PVE's wasteland transition period is too long, and the player's combat power improves the powerful talent brought by the level unlocking, leading to the preliminary experienceIt is very prison; on the other hand, there is a lack of a certain depth of LOOT system. If you play it behind you, you can't kill it, but you can't kill it. It is difficult to support the needs of long -term operations.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 was made by developers from Peter, so those whose relatives are now killing Ukrainians, those who now pay money for the needs of war criminals, those who are now flipping through the news and abusing another shelling of Ukrainian cities.And of course, those who directly help their army in the invading war, such as adjusting equipment, databases, sites, or actively spreading Kremlin propaganda.
Well

It should be noted separately that the developers themselves are hypocritically and cowardly hide where they come from.On any game resources of the segment of the segment there are all the news and comments to them in the spirit of ""Oghi -giggles have shaken the same !! 1"".Well, everyone knows everything, but they are officially hidden by the mask like an American company.Although Saber Interactive is a marsh company.About this a lot of information.
You can see more about the developers here:

Now about Focus Entertainment publisher.This publisher actively supports both information and money with many marsh companies.Yes, they gave out a Fart atom and a variety of Warhammer's trash 40,000: Space Marine 2 and others.It was in the fall of 2022 that they apologized to the rashists, it is not a joke, they really placed a post with aqua freshe and apologies, and this is exactly when they began to shoot cities in Ukraine massively.Imagine the level of cynicism!
You can hear about the publisher in this video:

So the conclusion is simple, do not buy all Saber Interactive games and preferably Focus Entertainment publisher, but it is more difficult with the publisher, because there are developers who have supported Ukraine, for example, developers A Plaague Tale: Requiem.
Also, I additionally provide information about the developer in text:



Do not buy this game, The Developer Is Located in the Russian Federation, in the City of St.Petersburg and Actively Supports War, Mass Murder, Shelling Of Cities, Kidnaping of Children, Rape, Etc.
Every Dollar from Sales of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is the Death of Another Peaceful Ukrainian.

The devs listening and bringing updates and changes upon what the audience as a whole seem to resonate with is also a breath of fresh air.

The fact the game can still be played in ""offline"" mode is a godsend in itself and a rarity for many a-game in 2024.

My only real complaints are things that can be changed & fixed with time. The bugs in the experience (I've had a few crashes).
The other is the lack of customization for the Chaos Space Marines minus paints and decals. I do see segments for pre-built armor sets, but who knows, maybe they'll open customization to it in the future if the game continues move forward.

- At the time of writing the review, the game has those problems and jambs of optimization (I personally had everything great, but my friends have no)
- there are problems of the network component, sometimes there is an incredibly long connection in which you simply boils and the customization settings are poorly preserved (they fly out to be banal from time to time)
- Price.Like a fan, of course I appreciated all the content that I was offered, but 3K is still a bit too much for the game in which content (without DLS and rechecies) is not so much.But this is recovered by the reigree and interest of the missions/operations themselves.In addition, the developers plan to introduce such additions and missions in the future, which encourages to continue to play this PROKK.
On this, the disadvantages ended for me personally, this is an excellent comprehensive adventure both on one person and a joint batch with 2 faithful friends!Operations on high difficulties abandon a good challenge, and PVP mode can slightly diversify the game.The guard also paid a lot of attention, the fans will clearly appreciate this, it is clear that the guys made the game with love and efforts, so special thanks to the developers for the full Russian voice acting, you are the best guys!And the feeling of infinity of opponents makes you believe in the inevitability of defeat and plunges into the world in full (unless there is not enough bestiaria and similar things, for those who do not fumble for the world of the 40th millennium)

Cubano,0,25.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049245659/,"I completed the game and every operation on difficulty 2/4.
I do not recommend this game and here is why:
- it feels bad to shoot any weapon other than melta or charged plasma because they deal no damage, it takes more than a clip from any bolt weapon to throw any medium unit into executable state (way way too long), enemies shrug 30-40 direct hits from HEAVY BOLTER like it was a toy gun
- melee is not fun, you get stagger locked and killed by medium enemies
- it feels bad to use chainsword (thunderhammer and power sword feels better but they are not available on 4/6 of operation classes), you cut down the small enemies, but fighting any medium+ is not fun - they will either dodge or play red or blue with you.
- medium+ enemies in melee stagger you with every hit, but your attacks do not
- enemies like to play with you in red and blue, dodge or parry, do it wrong and you lose 50%-75% of health
- enemies are able to teleport or dodge like 10 meters, your dodge is like 1m
- health and armor system is very badly implemented - SM1 had it much better. You cannot recover health with finishers, only armor, yet you lose armor almost instantly. To do a finisher on enemy you need to hit it real good to recover like 1 armor segment.

It is just not fun to play right now.
I do not want to play a class in operations for 10h before it feels fun to play, I want it to feel good from start and then just get better. Most people will play an operation or two, see it is not fun and leave.

Good things:


- The graphics are 10, I repeat myself, it looks like a movie.

- Absolute fidelity to the franchise

- Jeatage and mechanics


Bad:

- There is a loss of frames and a high CPU use that will be corrected in patches, so it is not a problem.

- The colors of the Pintaejercitos should be free.I can't create my chapter because the blue I need is DLC.I think the only payment should be cosmetic at the armor level without restricting colors.

- Some colors are not well painted according to areas because the tone does not match the color.

- DLC ranges.To create lieutenants and veteran sergeants you also need the DLC pattern and do not seem fair either.(I will buy the DLC later anyway)



Things I would put in the multiplayer:


- That when you personalize your sailor the colors applied are also applied to the rest of the entire fleet so that if you have your own chapter you feel that immersion.

- The PVP mode should also have a PVE from my point of view because I and all my friends are PVE players.(This is not necessary but there would be more casual people who simply want to have a good time with their friends)

I was a big fan of the first Space Marine, contrary to the negative reviews it was hailing at the time!In this respect, my joy was that there is a sequel very high!Unfortunately, I can't do this game a good rating!
It is neither due to the technology nor the atmosphere, that is so far and optically makes something really.The lighting, the huge swarms, the backdrop, everything very chic ... but ...

In my opinion, this game weakens on the combat system, and when it should be an action game ...
The entire fight simply looks extremely ""spongy"".You beat like wild, without any meaning and mind.Hits hailed from all sides so that man at times cannot do anything else except to permanently spam the spacebar.At no time you have the feeling that you somehow really influence the fight whether you play well or bad!There is one goal after the other and there is actually nothing you could do about it.Occasionally, if you notice it all over the bustle, you can knock out a block.Here the whole thing also looks massive, but it goes down completely in all the confusion.
I played it on heavy and easy, and completely sausage whether you are doing well or bad ... somehow you can get through!This does not require any skills or sophistication, but is a simple key hammer!

In the first part there was also a lot going on on the battlefields, but if I timed my attacks and finisher well, I had an impact on how the fight developed!I fought quickly, used narcotic strokes I was able to exist for longer in battle and ultimately decide the fight for me!

It doesn't matter how I fight, I collect the hits one way or another, then there is a counterattack every few seconds and a finisher that is wearing out extremely quickly.These counterattacks are also the only thing you really have in your hand.95% of the hits you still collect whether you skillfully avoid or not and in the end you come through the fight without actually knowing how!

The fights are simply too confusing and you just get away wildly with always and always ...... and always the same blunt attacks!If you face a bigger opponent, you will be hit by hormagants from behind hundred times that simply ""stick"" to your figure.
The blows are extremely imprecise and too often go to nothing.The navy simply trudge cumbersome and knocks out the same combo after the other.",2024/9/11,de

You can give a plus point in this attitude. After all, the officials2 official will not care about the player experience.
A few days later, the battle and cooperation and PVP content have been completed in a round. The difficulty is just right for me.
Level 4 is not as outrageous as he imagined and what others say. I am even a non -wheelchair person who plays shields.
The atmosphere rendering is very good in place, many times the performance is also very good, but some details are still poor.

I hope there are things that can really amazing players when they are officially launched.

Great Cinematic experience, better with friends, very cool.
Only low point I can think of are the ""Rats"" section of the 2nd mission and some downtime sections from the ""Cave"" mission.

PvP:
It's ok, a bit death-bally and significantly less emphasis on Melee in my short experience with it.
I didn't have much interest in it before and quickly lost interest in it, so I haven't played a lot of rounds nor grind each classes to unlock their other, more interesting weapons.

(Co-)Operations:

Patch 3.0 (2024/09/26) update:

Armor attrition vs Minoris is better which made the melee combat survivability less punishing or gunstrike reliant. Adjusted spawns for the Chaos faction nerfs made it less overwhelming.

Overall an improvement to the push forward combat that plays better and makes you feel more like a Space Marine, but also makes the game easier (which I think is alright as they will add new enemies and difficulty tier).

They also fixed the bugs with the Supply pod full healing characters with +20% max HP passive/ perk and healing past contested health bug with Melta/ Las Fusil/ etc. which is good.

Original Launch review:

Only having 6 missions on launch is terrible, -Tide games and World War Z had more on launch in the past and still needed more content.

Balance seemed all over the place.
At the higher difficulties, there are fewer resources, it felt similar to the tactical survival experience of Back 4 Blood and World War Z. Depending on your build, you want to be thrifty with ammo and to save it for a wave/ Terminus miniboss/ or an enemy calling for reinforcements from an out of reach place.

Enemies becomes bullet spongy at higher difficulties and are more numerous, and Medicae Stims heals less HP. Different weapon types seem to have different effectiveness vs specific enemies. Running away to the next airlock/ elevator to despawn enemies behind you is cheesy and effective, but not fun.

You have to ration your ammo in-between fixed ammo crate placements and try to use melee, the environment, and equipment you find as optimally as possible (explosive barrels, explosive flowers, and level gimmicks such as the fire wall at the end of the first mission or the train diverter control panel in the last mission).

Regardless of the difficulty, missions have RNG aspects to it such as the mid-level events requiring 0-6 (!) sub-objectives to complete.

Perk and class balance seemed to be all over the place, but I need to play more to be sure, and there seems to be some bugs or hidden effects.
Examples for balance stuff:
- Certain classes have ammo generation perks later on in their class (or weapon perk line) which seems to be a mandatory pick compared to the other options;
- Bulwark's 23 perk restores contested health to your max HP which substantially reduces the need for healing items when paired with executions, or allowing full heal + wound restoration when paired with a Medicae Stim.

Also you use the same currency to buy weapons, class perks, and Space Marine Chapter Customization and you always feel poor while progressing initially, with some classes having more expensive weapons (e.g. Assault).

You also need to grind each class and weapons types. You can max out a class to level 25 and still need to level other weapon types, but trying to do it in the higher difficulty sucks because your lower tier weapon is weak, negatively affecting the strength of the team and your character.",2024/9/7,en

A little word for experts and rageous of Bad Reviews (Negative Evaluation):

Before posting checking your PCs and letting the possibility give you help for your worries by activating the comments.

This game requires an advanced configuration, forget the minimum configuration, an SSD, and a PC with at least simmilar values ​​to that of optimal recomandation.
If despite this you still have problems, you will have to look elsewhere, for example via your task management to make what takes a lot of resources on your machine, see if all your drive is up to date etc ...
What I can say informative, the game works super well, fluid, no crash, configure as much as possible at the graphic level without loss of performance and I have a lot of free resources on my machine.

The configuration of the BIOS by the Mother Card Manufacturer for the last generation processors are often the cause of many problems on the new PCs (known at MSI and Asus, but others too).
An update of BIOS or adjustment of those if necessary to reduce overheating and planting of your PCs or to stabilize your processors.(receipt on processors 14th generation)

There will be a TL;DR at the end.

~

The game falls short of its own shadow in many ways.
It is without character development and story
It is without the variety.
It is with a less consistent/polished core loop.

The testosterone filled glory of the combat swells the brain with glee, but dulls after a few hours.

- Controls Are Awkward - KBM is trash, you’ll need a gamepad, although it’s not much better. You never really get used to it.
- Multiplayer Focus - In case you’re here for the campaign.
- - Repetitive, but not bad,
- Not 40k Faithful - Boltguns tickle enemies, Chew Through rare enemies, blasphemous plot, etc.
- Surprise! - It wants to be a Live Service game.
- Unfinished Grenade UI - they seem the same on HUD ?
- Gun Execute is Blah - at the beginning is super cool;not punchy enough, you end up chaining them together over and over to kill 1 guy.
- Ammo? - It is not precious, but it's also not plentiful.
- FOV - way too shallow
- ""Hold to interact"" - ew.
- Buggy - Including enemies shooting through walls, not picking up items, clipping, and more.
- Missing Features - Can’t snap to targets. Needed for controller.
- No squad customization - ???
- No Troop Variety - Never fight beside mechanical troopers or mercs. Sad.
- None of the little soldiers ever survive - :(
- Campaign Overstays Welcome - It's a 5-6 hour experience in an 8-9 hour package.
- Very Stingy on healing - Awkward unlike other games in the medium.

- Bullet Sponge Enemies - Dump 3 clips of bolter ammo into a normal guy’s head.
- Stun Locks - Get messed up and tossed around sometimes.
- Antithetical Dance - Combat stutters and fails to flow.
- No Upgrades in Campaign - All the cools stuff is in Multiplayer.
- Lack Of Mechanical Depth - Tastes like a cake missing ingredients
- Sound is off - voice is especially low.
- Flat characters - Unsurprising and uninteresting.
- No collectables - ????!?
- Health Sponge - Armor is fickle, and your health is constantly chipped down with few ways to earn it back.
- AI allies are goofy - and enemies disregard them.
- Invasive ""Always Online"" BS - Makes it harder to enjoy at times.
- NDA and Information Harvesting - I don’t usually have to sell my soul to play a game.
- Was that my gun? - Non-dynamic weapon models for cutscenes. C’MON IT’S 2024!
- Pinning animations are too long - repeating several times.
- Bosses are boring bullet sponges - Not mechanically challenging, just take forever.
- No Controller Presets where swapping weapons is NOT on the D-Pad - You will be doing this constantly
- Weapons don't feel like wins - they all feel like losers in some way.
- Pathetic weapon variety - They look drab and insultingly similar, they play the same.
- Bosses are normal enemies? - For some they just slap a big healthbar on a normal Elite enemy and recycle others.
- Neutral melee attacks… - cause your character to turn around and not attack where you're facing.

- Solid flow - fans rejoice!
- 2010's goodness - Simplicity!
- throwback - ""Cooridor Shooter"" vibes in a good way.
- Great Enemies! - Tyanid/Zerg foes are super fun to blast away at!
- Looks gorgeous - Pleasing to the senses!
- Music can be inspiring! - Swelling overtones!
- Juicy - Tons of executions and combat punch
- Guns sound powerful! - Even if they don’t do much, you feel like a beast
- Fun with Friends! - Everything is, but this is a good experience to share!
- Satisfying Destruction! - My therapist recommends this.
- Lots of cool locations! - No longer stuck on the machine world of !
- Nerds Rejoice! - Lots of little goodies for 40k fans!
- Lots of variety! - Modes, Modes, MODES! Throwback to 2009 with how much content!

is fun for a time. It’s novel for 40k fans who will enjoy the tropes, much like many star wars folks these days. Hyper dramatic combat loop dazzles at first and fizzles without variety, but keeps you engaged to get your money’s worth. Made me want to read the books, had novel vibes at times in a good way. It's more of the original Space Marine 1 without too much added, and that’s good in and of itself. The game has a AAA look and a mid-range feel; while suffering from the issue of having lots of enemies to kill and not enough resources to do so efficiently.

Brother AWAS,0,146.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198103479992/,"TLDR - The game is great but the initial experience during the early access was atrocious for co-op. I highly recommend it now but I can't leave a thumbs up for paying to play a Beta test for their co-op servers. Co-op was advertised ages ago, it should've worked for everyone in all regions.

My initial experience before the server maintenance:-
Get yer damn co-op servers running. We can barely play together dangit. It has bee 6 hours of being in game, half that time was either me looking at ""Joining server"" or my friend experiencing the same. And when we do play... it's not so bad. Game's pretty fun. But hot damn get the servers workin.

Another 7ish hours later and the co-op servers still suck.
Tried all the possible fixes on the internet and still nothing.
This game was advertised to having co-op so you'd expect to have it on the get go.

After the server maintenance:-
The co-op finally works.
No work around, no fiddling with the settings, just share your code and there's your friend in the lobby. The squad works in all game modes. I'm having fun and I'm enjoying everything the game has to offer and am excited to see what comes next on the road map.

If you wanna know more about the game itself check out the other reviews cause they can probably do a better job explaining it.

With all that said, first impressions count and that initial roller coaster of nothingness still has a lingering impact. We were told we could play the game early if we bought it early. Apparently, that only applied to certain people and in certain regions. Some people got their moneys worth while others didn't. As much as I want to leave a thumbs up for the game, I can't. I can tell you the game's good now overall but that's as far as it goes. I don't usually pre-order games but hot damn it was never bad enough to write a review about it.",2024/9/6,en

Hikarian,0,3.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mehendre/,"In principle a good game, but I just can't support laziness with a clear conscience.But what does that mean?

Graphically, the game is very good, but no masterpiece but you consider how many opponents are involved at the same time.I play on 4K with a 7900xtx and an alienware Oled Monitor.Everything on Max and you have optimized between 40-80 fps very well.Unfortunately no HDR support.

The story is total nonsense if you know your way around the lore, the whole planet should be full of Space Marines so that you have a chance at all, but it's good a game that is also ok.

Where does laziness come into play?In the combat system, actually that could be a horny shooter, but the developers force a mix of close combat and ranged so I have no problem Darkide did it very well.

But here this is extremely poorly implemented, you only get on the mouth because you are constantly surrounded. The game is building on the fact that you can endure what bothers me is that the opponents AI especially and explicitly attack the player, big opponents likeThe Carnifex can block ranged attacks completely, with 2 swords yes it is clear.Higher levels of difficulty are totally lame made simply opponent has more HP and makes more damage.In the melee attacks you thought if you installed the blows more, but it was totally forceful after every hit, but apparently I am the only one who bothers.Ranged fighters always hit you when you don't actively avoid, so only stay in motion doesn't really help.

In principle, it is WWZ in the Warhammer Universum The Tyranids even climb exactly as the zombies up where.

I think if you play that in the Coop with real people, it's certainly funny but with bots the weaknesses just stand out.If you couldn't play a spacemarine here, but that there would be any other setting I can well imagine that the game would also have flopped.

Objectively, Darktide would be the better game if Fattshark lets itself down to install a campaign or to do anything with the story.

Conclusion: You can treat yourself to if the money is scarce for a sale that will certainly not take long before Christmas.It is a good game that does not do justice to the hype.You could have really got more out of the combat system.",2024/9/7,de

The sequel to the TPS Shooting Game Space Marine in the Warhammer worldview

I don't remember any memories because it's old, but there is an image that has been quite fun.

In anticipation of the Gold Edition, I played the Gold Edition and played the 4th on the 4th with Advanced Access.



After sweeping the opening videos and the crowded juggling enemies

Expectations for the game have risen, but the expectation did not last long.



There are quite a few things to see with a fairly large planet scale battle and directing.

The configuration of the stage itself is strongly given the feeling of the battle -battle -moving -battle

There are very few additional elements such as the growth factors and skill acquisition of the characters according to the progress

Core gameplay is quite dependent and lacks in depth.

The lack of many types of enemies or impressive bosses accelerates this feeling.



Skills or weapons level ups that would have been good to be in the campaign exists in PVE mode.

There are only six PVE missions, and except for the difficulty stage

It's hard to find motivation or fun to play repeatedly.



Still, the gameplay itself is satisfying the fun of the basic TPS shooting game

It may be fun to break the campaign + PVE mission once

Finzy,1,22.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyfinzy/,"Basing this off of the singleplayer campaign, I'd give this game a neutral review if I could, I enjoyed some parts of it and some parts not so much. First off the game does look and sound amazing and does Warhammer 40,000 every bit of justice it possibly can, there's tons of detail everywhere and the environments and scale of the enemy hordes are seriously impressive. And it's not just a cosmetics thing, you can see the swarms climbing walls and such and you can destroy them. The basic combat once you get used to the parry and dodge system works pretty well and the weapons feel like they all have a use; I tried to use most of the weapons I picked up during my playthrough and there were few straight up upgrades, more like sidegrades.

The structure of the missions is very linear and there's generally very few things to find apart from audio logs. At the start of the game it felt like you got obstructed very often, I kept walking into invisible walls, but I think the game opens up later on more and the midway part of the campaign had the best mission variety. Sadly I think the campaign falls off towards the end, but other than that, I mostly had a good time. I wish the jetpacks would have been used more in missions.

Now onto the things I didn't like; the whole campaign seems designed more for co-op play than singleplayer. The AI teammates are generally very bad at covering you while doing objectives (+ they cannot do objectives themselves), and you'll regularily get pinned down by ranged enemies all the time, so in every encounter you have to hyperfocus the ranged enemies down first because the AI won't be doing that. At first I started the campaign on Veteran difficulty and I found it to be too annoying to complete with the AI so I switched to Normal after a couple missions and had a much better time. But still the squad AI could really be better, the game should offer a more balanced singleplayer experience. (EDIT: This was improved in patches which is good!)

Also (potential spoilers warning), the campaign isn't very long, I finished it in just about 11 hours, while generally taking my sweet time to explore as well. Towards the end it's like they forgot the beginning of the invasion (Tyranids) completely and the ending felt very cliche and Disney like. I did like that they introduced more enemies later on and I'm a fan of different than usual Chaos factions being represented but it felt like there should have been more story missions across all the planets. I know there's the Operations mode and Eternal War, and I expect that'll add a lot more playtime, but the main campaign felt quite short. (EDIT - Operations has been quite fun if a bit grindy, Eternal War is a pretty typical pvp mode and could use more interesting maps and customization imo)

The game ran well on my laptop with an i9 13980 HX, 32 GB RAM and Nvidia 4090 RTX 16 GB; on 2560x1600 resolution I could play it on high settings with ultra textures (without any upscaling), getting between 60-80 FPS. Some of the larger fights dipped as low as 50 but not below that. I'll probably test how it runs at 4K later on but I'd expect it to require some DLSS at least.

I didn't like that the game has no support for aspect ratios other than 16:9, so at 16:10 I had constant black bars on my screen all the time and it should really be fixed as it's a standard feature in PC games. Also, there was no support for inverted horizontal camera controls for gamepad, so I couldn't play it on gamepad since I use fully inverted controls (both vertical + horizontal) in all games I play; another thing that should be fixed and added to options. Had to learn to play on keyboard & mouse instead :p

TL;DR:
Solid gameplay; nice WH40K aesthetic; poor AI and mission design more for co-op; short campaign that falls off towards the end; some annoying missing technical features",2024/9/8,en

Sieghart,0,116.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042573112/,"Edit: I'm switching some categories around and migrating my overall reason for not recommending the game to lean more towards the incredibly unstable matchmaking system.

Pros
-Intense and dynamic combat
-Great graphics
-Interesting story so far
-Multiplayer is fun and addicting (have not tried PvP yet)
-There's a nice blend of needing to use all weapons at your disposal

Cons
-Friendly bot AI is not the best. They seem to be randomly aggressive and passive at weird intervals.
-The matchmaking system is quite unstable, leading to excessive load screens. I don't actually believe this is a server performance issue, I think it's how the matchmaking system is currently designed. *If a player queues for quick match and...: 1. gets a mission they don't like and leaves the squad. 2. does not want to be a party leader and leaves the squad / quits to title screen. ...this seems to have a direct impact on the players who get pulled into the queue of this player that did not stick around. I believe (not a confirmed fact) this is why we see a lot of ""joining server"" load screens that take a long time. I want to say the game is not optimized for dealing with these scenarios.

Pro/Con
-Ammo economy can be rough in some points of missions and can make progression more difficult than expected. Learning to search crates for ammo and being wise with ammo consumption helps with this.
-There is a strong focus on needing to use the parry system. Some people may hate that, others may not. Once you get the hang of it though, your gameplay improves quite a bit.
-Incoming damage is a bit rough, especially melee attacks, but this does condition you to block, parry, and improve movement more.
-There is an intense amount of grinding needed to achieve progression in multiplayer. Some may see this as a good thing to stay motivated to play, others may think it's too much of a grind fest and not enjoy it.
-Restricting multiplayer play to one class per player. This creates diversity however is an immediate generation of frustration for players who can't consistently play the class they wish to play.

An entertaining linear story mode at around 5-6 hours (on Normal mode), though for maximum enjoyment you should have played or at least seen a recap of Space Marine 1. (And/or understanding Warhammer 40K lore)

A 3 man Co-op ""Operations"" mode that sees you play as your own different Marines that you can customize head to toe (from 6 different classes) and go on missions with other aspiring recruits/players trying to level up and score better gear.

Though at the moment there are only 6 missions to complete. They mostly feel good to play through, and multiple runs are needed to upgrade and level up your Space Marine.

(This is also the live-service, seasonal part of the game so expect content updates unless something completely unexpected happens).

There is also a very fun but very dry no nonsense PVP akin to old COD lobbies but without the vulgarities, racism, and probably no no-scopes (yet).

Hope the devs update this ""Eternal War"" mode as well cause there is some good building blocks to work with.

Combat is very fun, consisting of dodges and parries to outmaneuver and counterattack the enemy respectively.

Not too much to learn other than the timings of parries/dodges and melee combos of each weapon but the chaotic horde-style gameplay will still sometimes give you problems even if you have mastered the intricate art of murdering other Alien lifeforms.

Снежок,0,2.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/snejoc/,"What can I say.The expectations were large.And in the end, the bunch turned out, let's start in order:
1. The fight is a full hat.Something can be done in battle 1 to 1. As soon as you meet with two 3 large beetles, all the parries are dodging and so on it goes forest.It is possible to cope with the crowd only if it is ordinary persimmon.
2. Shooting pistols of plasma bolts and so on is almost useless.You can, of course, shoot the jokes for the sake of jokes, but in general it is almost pointless.
3. There is almost no story company.Everything is imprisoned for a not very interesting coop.And the screensavers before the mission where you and your companions sit inside the ship generally smell of session crafts.
4. The missions are the same type and boring.Go around the tunnel, grate with beetles, see how they climb onto the wall on each other.
5. Dialogues of sailors are a separate cal.There is no need to talk about Beck of the Universe again.
6. There is no character of the character, from the word at all, all that can be changed is the skin from DLS.We are waiting for boxes with keys.
7. I didn’t play online, but remembering the first part and given the gameplay of this part there is a full hell.

Efendi_,0,76.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004908459/,"Regrettably i am leaving a negative review pointing out the serious shortcomings of Space Marine 2 as a veteran Vermintide/Darktide player who loves 40k lore.

- During the first launch of the game, Epic games online components are installed automatically without a prompt screen. I do not want it in my computer. You have to go through loops to uninstall it. There is a reason why i am using steam and steam only and i want the developers to respect it.
- When compared with Darktide, Dawn of War series and especially Mechanicus, Space Marine 2 has the weakest music OST. Looks like it was not even at top ten of the priority list during development.
- As a cheap attempt, the game is trying to draw more attention by Twitch drops.
- Very terrible companion ai. One of the worst i have seen for years. They do not use their ranged weapons in most cases and run gret distances to melee an enemy regarless of the class. And they very rarely execute a stunned elite enemy who is only two feet away from them. Such a shame.
- No FOV slider.
- Holding buttons to activate the abilities, instead of hitting them, is a terrible design choice.
- Throwing a frag grenade takes two seconds, activating cloak takes another 2.5 seconds. Character gets hit during uncancellable animations. Every movement and ability use feels unresponsive and stiff during the campaign and multiplayer. Runningg gets interrupted for no reason even if you are holding shift and not even hit by anything.
- Uncancellable dodge, roll over and similar animations are the primary reason why i keep dying. Controls feel very unresponsive.
- Boss fights are almost identical. Area attacks such as some form of 3 round mortar shots, melee charge attacks, ranged attacks and one big 3-wave either green or purple wide area attack which can hit even behind cover is the same rinse and repeat mechanic for both tyranid and chaos bosses.
- Melee combat is terribly designed. Interruptions are common and costs the player half of his health points.
- Ranged weapons feel weak. An elite enemy (Not a boss or a lecter) takes 30 to 40 bolter rounds to put down. Crossing bone swords makes the enemy immune to ranged damage even if you hit the legs, head or spray it from sides.
- The enemies i have mentioned above are bullet sponges but a hit from them take out half of your hp.
- Crowd control options are limited to grenades. I suggest developers to play Vermintide and Dark Tide to see how it is perfected during many years.
- There is a hideous terrible jetpack mission. I hated it.
- Multiple 'Loading resources - loading logic' screens.
- Entire multiplayer lobby system has to be redesigned. It is bad.
- You cannot inject your allies with the stimpack you have in your inventory.
- PVP section of the game is the worst. Very unbalanced. Is this game not beta-tested?
- Cheaters are out there already. I have already witnessed speedhacks and maphacks.
- Easy Anticheat is known as how 'Easy' it is to bypass it. A bad choice from the developers.
- The number of the co-op missions is very few. These missions in general feel rushed, unfinished and exteremely repetitive with very little variation. Even the spawn locations are more or less the same.
- Unlocking armor pieces or better versions of the same weapon is very grindy. This is how the game targets longevity.
- The game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly. I do not expect it to have a long lifespan.
- I was unable to pickup some medkits, ammo boxes or grenades even i had the inventory slot available. Pickup prompt was not there.
- Ranged enemies shoot with 120% accuracy and every shot lands perfectly.
- There is a shield or armor mechanic which recharges a specific amount with combo kills. This mechanic is not working as intended and definitely not user friendly.

Cnclusion: 6/10. Wait for a discount or buy the cheapest package if you must. After the hype is dead, the game will no longer be played by most of us. I believe that Space Marine 2 would be a great game if it was released 10 years ago.",2024/9/11,en

Summary:
A game like those of yesteryear (that there is also not to go far), with a phenomenal story, shots to mansalva, very difficult and sometimes frustrating mechanics, but that once you exceed the level of gratification is high.Its history is spectacular and that all Warhammer or fan of the action will enjoy and the characterization of the characters is sublime, as it should be in all games.

History:
Simply brilliant, even if you are a fan of Warhammer 40k and come to look for shots, the story and how it develops in the end is exquisite, to be able to live the conversations of the chapter between soldiers, the ship, its hierarchy, the rest of theFactions that appear, characters excellently well defined and mature (in this Woke of Agenda 2030 where all are teenagers and men are not men, so you have to emphasize it).Do not expect anything else, action in raudales like any Gears of War was at the time and enjoy as a dwarf.

Graphics:
Spectacular is to fall short, as the story progresses and the particles are taking more paper, the experience of each level is increasing.Tyranids are great and the missions against them too, but in the end of half/end takes another concept.In addition, being able to live the battle in the field with the Astra Military and the rest of the chapter is incredible.Super immersive.

Playability:
This is where you can fail, SM2 The game introduces you to play in difficult and with the 4 tips that give you quite a regular way makes it very frustrating, it costs a lot to catch the quiet to the game and know when to defend yourself from the 4 shotsThey hit you and leave you on the floor.But I admit that in the face of half when I could understand how playing it I started enjoying a lot.Do not wait for a new invention, but within its simplicity it is just what you are looking for, action, shots and kill three hundred enemies.

Important:
No feminist political agenda in the game.Men are men, women women and history focuses on that: Warhammer 40k, not who is better than another or how another believes another.It's like games 5 years before the entire political agenda.Here you can sit and enjoy an action adventure.What I fear is that in the face of the next one they are going to put an agenda, so we will be enjoying the last title of the West that is for the great majority of the market.

Hopefully not!

My Biggest cons with this game is the fact that parry and dodge is sometimes very unresponsive.
the dodge indicator shows up got disappears before the enemy has even done the attack, leaving you clueless to when to actually time it correctly. Same goes for the parry indicator.

Campaign is about 10-12hrs give or take (at least it's twice as long as the first game).

The Multi player Pve missions are fun and tie in well with the Campaigns story.

Season Pass for 40€, you wot m8?

Never tried the PVP, but i'm not a pvp player and it looked just like the first games PVP.

Now should you buy this game?
If you really really enjoy the story of the Ultramarine Titus, then yeah sure buy it.
If you really enjoy Left 4 Dead playstyle games, Then yeah sure buy it.
BUT I would storngly urge you to buy it on a big sale, I got 16hrs out the game after doing 4 PvE missions, and the campaign on Angel of Death difficulty. It isn't value for money unless you buy the game for the PvE and PvP mode.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – A Brutal War in the Grim Darkness of the Future! (ฅ'ω'ฅ)

""An exhilarating, gory, and action-packed sequel that lives up to the scale of the Warhammer 40K universe, but with some notable flaws in balance and technical polish.""


Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 thrusts players into the brutal and unrelenting world of the Warhammer 40K universe, continuing the tale of the Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. Developed by Saber Interactive, this third-person action game places you in the superhuman armor of a Space Marine as you combat the horrifying Tyranid swarm in intense, blood-soaked battles. Building on the success of its predecessor, Space Marine 2 offers solo and co-op gameplay, featuring both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes to keep the action fresh and chaotic.


The moment you step into Titus' power armor, the scale of Space Marine 2’s combat becomes apparent. The game’s standout feature is its seamless combination of gunplay and melee combat, allowing players to switch between devastating bolter shots and brutal close-quarters executions. The spectacle of mowing down endless Tyranid swarms is both thrilling and terrifying, thanks to the sheer number of enemies onscreen, powered by Saber’s Swarm Engine.

The visuals are equally impressive, capturing the grim, gothic aesthetic of the 40K universe. From the ruined hive cities to the expansive battlefields littered with the corpses of xenos and humans alike, the game never shies away from its dark atmosphere. The orchestral score and guttural sounds of bolters firing and chainswords revving heighten the sense of chaos, making every battle feel cinematic.

However, the combat system, while exhilarating, does suffer from balance issues. Melee attacks dominate the battlefield, often making ranged weapons feel underpowered, particularly when faced with larger enemies. The tactical depth you'd expect from wielding the mighty bolter or plasma gun is somewhat diminished by their lack of punch, especially when it inexplicably takes a full magazine to down a basic Tyranid warrior. This can lead to frustrating moments, especially for players who prefer a ranged combat style.

The co-op and PvP modes are a welcome addition, extending the game’s replayability. Operations, the co-op missions, allow players to team up with friends to tackle harder challenges, but the real test comes in the PvP mode, Eternal War, where teams of Space Marines face off against the forces of Chaos. Both modes offer progression systems with plenty of unlockable perks and cosmetics, though the limited variety in mission design can make long play sessions feel repetitive.













Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers on its promise of fast, bloody, and exhilarating combat in the vast and unforgiving Warhammer 40K universe. The game’s atmospheric design, gripping story, and expansive multiplayer modes make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and action games alike. However, the imbalance between melee and ranged combat, along with some technical glitches, prevent it from reaching its full potential.

For those who love diving into the lore of Warhammer or who are looking for a gory, action-packed co-op experience, Space Marine 2 is a solid recommendation. Just don’t expect a perfectly polished experience or to rely heavily on your bolter.

Under the blessing of the new generation of the screen, this 40K battlefield shocked this one, and it is also pointed in many difficult 40K games.

But why not recommend it?

Because I have played the difficulty of the death angel and I am puzzled by some designs of the game

In a single game:
The infamous elevator guards the 4 chain, and it can be said that it has certain requirements for your efficiency of killing the enemy to flexibly use the scene resource to pass the grenades and explodes the grenades.

However, I can’t understand the scene of the mechanical database development motor. The scene requires you to use the fireproofer to expel the torn worm and turn on the engine and guard for a period of time.
OK, why do you need to set up a long -handed remotely to deal with it when you need to remotely maintain environmental security with short hands?

The pistol can control OK, but the difficulty of the death angel causes the brain insect and meat without changing a large gun.In the case, hit the brain insect to red temperature

OK, can I clean up the ground efficiently and then dry the brain?However, the difficulty of death angels lead to all worm meat and flesh, ordinary double -knife samurai also requires two sets of combo or two guns to hit the red temperature while paying attention to the small tadpoles on the ground.

Can the fireproofer barbecue?You can pinch but the fire is too bright. You can't see the blue circle and red circle. You can only be Euler with the worm. If you are not careful, you will be killed by the despicable insects in the sky in the sky.

Then change the big gun.EssenceEssenceWhy do you have a 1.5 -second confirmation circle for picking a gun?EssenceEssenceWhat blood bag is 1.5 seconds?EssenceEssenceEssenceThe grenade also wants.EssenceEssenceObviously the bullet was taken in an instant.EssenceEssence

In the end, I was red and warm. The crazy grenade skills were used to get the medicine back to the blood generator Qin Wang around AI.
It feels that the core problem is the difficulty of death, it seems that worms have changed meat.Under the difficulty of the veteran soldiers, the warrior 1 shot and 2, 3 knives (1 set of half a consecutive move) can be red and warm, and the death angel requires 2 shots plus 2, 3 sets (two and a half consecutive moves) to red temperature

And our Grandpa Thailand uses his mediocre 3+ shotgun (other weapons is also the basic value), whether it is the veteran or the death angel.EssenceThere was no upgrade content during the battle, which caused Grandpa Thai to use the whiteboard value of the whiteboard value even when it was duel with the final BOSS duel.

Multi -player game PVE:
""Oh, ah, this game is just a single player to support a card. Why is it tangled about this?"" I said nothing wrong with you. I think the feelings of this game.I only tried PVE, so PVP did not comment for the time being.

It can be seen that the production team spent a lot of energy to create 6 occupations, each occupation nearly 20 characteristics, nearly 20 weapons, each weapon, each has a variety of varieties and upgrades, and it feels very dark.The mission is the deputy team that played Grandpa Thai Grandpa in the plot. It is as difficult as the plot.After watching the upgrade options of the weapon, it turned out that Grandpa's 3+ shotgun can finally become 9+. No wonder the difficulty of death is so difficult to be the most elite blue elves outside the main battlefield (red temperature)

Three melee occupations (mad war, assassin, tank) 3 long -range occupations (rifles, sniper, machine gun brothers) can also experience all kinds of fun Thai grandpa for each occupation?Grandpa Tai is the grandfather.

But some of the settings of the game always make me a little confused:
Life value replies: It seems that there are no rest stations in various PVE games in the game. Only the weapon stations for changing equipment. There are only a few blood bags in the map that need to be distributed between three saudial elves, resulting in the blood volume in the task.The more and less in the middle.除了少数职业有“在XX情况下回复1%血量”或者“30%血量下，只要XX就能恢复5%血量”这种回血的天赋，大多数人只能靠倒了拉起和Rebirth to restore your own state.It is indeed a problem with difficult cooperation.

Shield value: Obviously, the production team hopes that the player will make more guns, and the shield will be made to reduce the pressure on the blood bars. Although there is invincible time, it seems that the gun will be interrupted by the red circle attack.The execution of the animation is very handsome, but it is also full. For example, the worm is red and warm. I am a machine gun brother. I may continue to scan and continue to scan two more shots.Worm.It feels that in the actual combat, most people are almost after the team battles are almost finished, and the insects who will challenge the red and warm back are back. I think the better situation is that the elite and the knife and insects have been executed for 1 second to 2 seconds. This may be close to melee.Occupation is more friendly.

Pick up things: 1.5 seconds, why?Make up ammunition?OK, full state, a little punishment, understanding.gun?Afraid of getting the wrong gun, okay.Grenades?I'm afraid that I will change the wrong grenade.Blood bag?Are you afraid I will get more blood bags?The general design waiting circle is because there are multiple uses or conflicts with other behaviors, or the items overlap, or the important choice of key items.The residual blood stimulated all the way to the sloppy worm and finally saw a blood bag & grenado result and could not pass by picked it up (red temperature)

Enemark reminder: The red circle prompt behind appears, you guess what it is.Whether the samurai crosses me, or the brainworm loses me towards me, or the snake worm stab me or the ax is going to throw me.The brain insect is thrown twice, and the rays may be delayed.The only rays that can be recognized are sniper.This has not involved the chaos.What elites on the field rely on the punctuation of good people, especially the Tyron family rushed over in a ball. The light samurai was 4 variants.People.Anyway, the dark tide also gave the elite the big green night view instrument, and inserted some totems on the head of the head, saying that there was a force to say something.There is no special sound effect on this group of white purple and purple tooth dance claws.

Criminal control: clear group, PVE classic bridge section.Do you know Brother?I feel like it is close to the battle brother sucking monsters. The two shot madly.Once the melee brother can't hold it, it seems that there is no occupation to have ridicule, push, block similar skills, and the pressure of long -range brothers has increased greatly.Qingqun weapons are sledgehammers and charging power swords, followed by machine guns, hot melt.Most of the maps have fewer places such as corridor room passing.

Then 6 pictures, so many occupations, so many weapons, just one word, liver.There are 4 aggressive agents in the dark tide, and there are six saudious elves here!IntersectionHowever, there is no weapon entry, and the talent is more passive but not connected to the weapon. It is difficult to imagine what motivation can continue to brush after full level.

I have given so much to give me a not recommendation, because I feel that the content now seems to be at a glance, but I also hope that this game can be done well.40K is known for its dung tour. In the past few years, the game that has changed but the game is also a history of chocolate or chocolate flavor.However, with the publication of the merchant Ronin and the response of the praise of the combat brothers in September 9th, the weapon system will be updated at the end of the dark tide at the end of the month. Is the good life of 40K people come?
Finally, I hope that the SABER group will develop well, with more pictures, and more distinctive and recognizable enemies, which will enable players to develop the talent of interesting gameplay and some of the problems I described above.EssencePlease change it.EssenceEssenceOr do you understand why I designed why?

Review on September 9th

My God has never seen such an unstable server after playing Swedish fat shark
Be strange to one more card operation, one more card, just card, as long as people want to do a ""bomber anti -gun, roll over and spray hot melt again"", the basic operation of the strange group of swimming has a high probability that the server explodes directly
At first I thought it was too high to open the screen, the computers can’t work too much for the particle special effects
The full -opening and low effects are still this way to give you one card, one card, the difficulty melee, do n’t play the knife, and you ca n’t fight the Asian space interference. Total of the September 9th list is to welcome the fighting brothers as chives?Intersection

The PVE weapon is completely unbalanced, and the existence of various models of shotguns is meaningless. The efficiency is not as efficient as hot melt and long -range efficiency.
Hot melting kills all penetrating values ​​unlimited damage and unlimited high, and the talent of killing and rebound is hot -melt.
The special combat soldiers have a 15000+ damage 450+ kill each melee and the two melee will not be able to get together.
Melee brother pure buff pendant person gives hot -melt tactical Gothic back to the shield skills
Special combat brothers and even long -range shield skills can cause AOEDOT damage to add BUFF to the surrounding combat brothers. This special war brother is the core of melee?Intersection

Key factor for this review) So the date of release comes around and i boot up and dive in. I'm going to keep this short and to the point. The Campaign was absolutely amazing, the scenes of battle and fighting through battlefields was amazing and immensely fun. They really captured the feel of 40k with every mission. Superb.... Roughly 8-9 hours later.... Story finished.... And honestly i cant give any reason to come back to this game after finishing the campaign. I had built up in my head that they were going to go down the Hell Divers route with this game and open it up a bit, really expand on the online social aspect of it. But they never. Its a very linear short story which is great mind you. Cant fault the gameplay and story at all. its Space Marine 1 improved, not expanded and that's my problem with it. There are like... 6-8 online operations that you can play as a team online with 2 other players and you can play those over and over again i suppose if you want to unlock different armors etc.... but to what end? To play through the same 6 missions with new armor? There is the online but like Space Marine 1, i just cant recommend it at all. Played one match and noped out of there. Does a linear story at 8 hours long survive in today's climate? I'm not sure. But i would be lying if i said i wasn't disappointed that i'm essentially just uninstalling this game after playing it for 8 hours. Though those 8 hours were fun and very well put together story wise. If you're fine with a linear 8 hour story with some side content sprinkled in to top it off then i would say go for it.

Ok so, after 40 hours playing mostly operations I still recomend the game with some caveats.

The campaign is amazing.

The difficulty pushing in OPS tho is retarded.
There are so many problems with difficulty that has been written by me and DodoSwarm on the offical forums I will just link the thread.



Bottom line is difficulty needs heavy tweaking or there has to be an economy added for armory data/requisition.

If you are not into ball busting difficulty (like inferno on diablo 3 release), but want to progress and not satisfied with PVP and Campaign offerings don't buy it.
Operations higher difficulty is a mess.

For a fan of Wahi, this is an absolute masthead, this is the same AAA project that we have been waiting for so many years, setting, plot, iconic characters - you just sit and screech like a child.Epic only increases with each mission and in general the company goes as much as necessary.A bunch of steep staged scenes, incredibly beautiful and detailed locations - this is just some kind of festival of pathos and admiration.

Usually, after passing onto a fresh head, you begin to look for the cons, but here I just do not see them objectively, except for a not too balanced fighting, where you lose all the hp and without a cooperative to drag the Laste of difficulty just anryl.But in general, the fighter is cool, she literally lacks 10-20% of the grinding so that you can always drag on the skill, because sometimes there are so many enemies that you do not have time to dodge, spar and plus can be canceled, which also sometimes makes you get a slap in the face.But in general, for the entire company I have never felt a sense of stuffiness and that I want to drop everything.

The only returning to difficulty, I strangled to play at 3 and became 2 and even there you can see the problems of balance, it does not strongly spoil the impressions of the game for 2 difficulties, all that is not higher than a balanced blood pressure that will need to be corrected if I tried to go throughEverything is on them, most likely, it would not have any reason for the wing of the developers as a majority of negative reviews, so I hope that after a full release, the developers will somehow correct this with patches, otherwise it is non-granous.

In general, this is currently the coolest, large -scale game of Wahe, every fan must pass it without fail, and an ordinary player can also enjoy it and MB even roll up.I am incredibly satisfied and pleasantly amazed that the studio surpassed all my expectations, without even touching the online component, one company is already repulsing any price, so I look forward to the trickel.",2024/9/9,ru

10 hrs last two weeks / 10 hrs on record
I really like this game it feels great to play and am happy a road map was already shown to address many issues. Though I have a few things I wish they would add and change.

Changes:
- It does not make sense to have operations and pvp not transfer your level in between each other. If I grind my level in operations my level should be the same for pvp so that I can access all the weapons I grinded for.
- make it easier to level up
- Add another class like tech marine, apothecary, chaplain
- Make it so that heretic astartes are not locked in to only 1 class

Additions:
- For pvp they should add execution kills to make the game cooler
- Add a parry mechanic because melee against character feels just like who hits first gurantees a win.
- Buff the assault class it is definitely the weakest class overall. Make the animations fast , maybe give it a stun when it slams in the air and more armor so it does not instantly die and add lightning claws.
- Add more voice lines for the narration and the characters its annoying only hearing the same phrases over and over
- Give the heretic astartes more customization options as it is a bit disappointing that you can only change their color
- add more traitor legions like emperors children, wordbearers, sons of horus, and Thousand sons
- give loyalist unique voicelines for loyalist legions as it was done for heretics
- Add more enemies from different chaos factions other than Tzeetch.

Judge Cudge,0,6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012825255/,"You do not feel like a Space Marine in this game.

In singleplayer PVE on just veteran difficulty, which is supposedly the intended experience, even (close to) perfect play rewards you with gameplay of being constantly whittled down by weenies into flickeringly low hp when reacting to all commands perfectly and swiftly headshotting and executing every enemy whilst never being hit by even a single clean attack from anything other than explicitly and only small enemies hitting you during your own melee attack combos on larger ones.

Why is the game this way?
Even supposing this is somehow balanced around multiplayer, the mindset that somehow your hypervulnerability is the right way to accomplish this is just incorrect.

This isn't left for darktide (tm) where teamwork needs to be clumsily reinforced by having insta downs/squishiness that let people pretend they are helping eachother in the most hamfisted design decision of all time.

We are walking super human tankmen fighting bugs, and the intended gameplay experience leaves you scrambling for medicae at all times.

I win every time, but I never once feel cool or strong, and further because I am so limited on HP and ammo my reactions are all on rails.
I ALWAYS have to go for the gun reaction post parry.
I ALWAYS have to go for a cutscene execute to gain armor.
I ALWAYS have burn grenades at swarm pillars cascading up walls.
I ALWAYS pick up and use the 'use here' guns like the flamethrower.
I ALWAYS use my super mode on cooldown to scrounge HP.

I feel like a pathetically weak and clunky man walking through a giant quick time event.

Why did they do this? How is being a paper mache weakling who is forbidden from making gameplay decisions the 'intended experience'?

I want to feel like a space marine.

I recommend a stretch with a stretch for passing with friends.

The game has one big plus - you feel half the time in the epicenter of the blockbuster.A lot of fat thick action with hordes of enemies.WAU effect is guaranteed.

And there are many minuses:

1. The game is annoying.At the same time, you need to protect several objects in different parts of the base.The sensors give you a signal that you need to parry the attacks right now.And you are not up to it.At the same moment, the operator nervously yells at you that the Gorguli damaged the antenna.And you still need to recharge very slowly at this second while the beetles are eating you.And you need to do this somewhere every five seconds.

2. I did not like the shooting right away.It is not felt here as cool as, for example, in Destiny, or Hell Divers 2. somehow nothing special.

3. Instead of combat dance - awkward confusion.This is if you, like me, are hard to combine 3D action with Dark Souls - yes, here you need to regularly tumble and parry the attacks.How tired it is ...

4. The cartoon of shock heroes can be forgiven.But seriously the game is more difficult to perceive.

5. A lot of invisible walls.

And the game freezes at the exit.

I don’t even attribute a completely passing plot to the minuses, it is here for a checkmark.And it is balanced as a whole by high -quality graphics.",2024/9/11,ru
Shinigami-Sama,1,40.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130967517/,"Having just finished the game i am of two minds about it:

The Good: It builds on the first game and does a great job of making you feel like a space marine. Your powerful and hit like a truck, it is friendly to the lore and brings the world of 40k to life. I have seen some reviews talking about the first half of the game being the worst part and i have to disagree. The first half of the game defending worlds from tyranids is amazing and exciting. Watching a whole swarm descend on a guarded position as you, your brothers and the scared guardsmen hold the line is great.

And now here is where the bad comes in:

The second half of the game feels like a rehash of the first game. It feels like they just wanted to have you fight chaos for pretty much no reason other than you did it in the first game. This is a issue as it left me wanting more, you just seemingly wipe the nids and chase chaos and to me this was boring. When they showed there would be three worlds to fight on i was expecting a long story where i am jumping from world to world dealing with its attackers and i feel this is what saber should have done. It should have been you fighting the nids on one world whilst chaos attacks another and a 3rd faction the other and then have them merge. But instead its simply hey you seemingly dealt with the nids now go fight chaos for the last act.

Overall i recommend it if you are a fan of 40k or the first game as it does fill the need of 40k fun and that fun from the first game. Just dont expect it to fill you at the current moment roughly 2 days of playing and i have finished the story on veteran i expected more saber.

You don’t play as a Space Marine — you ascend to one, crushing heretics and xenos alike with the elegance of a chainsword tearing through alien flesh.

The setting? A masterpiece of gothic despair, where every ruin and skull (so many skulls!) reminds you that the galaxy hates you — and you're here to hate it right back. Tyranids swarm like they own the place (spoiler: they don’t), and Chaos whispers temptations you answer with righteous ultraviolence.

Graphics? So good it’s practically a heretical experience. My PC now has a Machine Spirit that groans every time I boot it up. Gameplay? It’s like the Codex Astartes came to life and gave you a chainsword, saying, “Go forth and do the Emperor’s work.”

Flaws? Just one: I can’t shout FOR THE EMPEROR loud enough to match the carnage on-screen. But that’s not the game’s fault — that’s on me.

However, there is no reward for promoting the main story.
You ca n’t unlock the level with your friends.
In disguise, players push the main line by themselves
The desire to make people want to play a story mode

The other is that the content and levels are less

The 6 levels are really too small

PVP feels just something that is stuffed hard at all
It's okay, the production team might as well spend time to strengthen the stand -alone and cooperative content
Even if you do n’t have a plot, you can give two more maps better

The direction of balance needs to be improved
There are several options for similar weapons, but there are very few useful use
There are not much to use, a bunch of garbage guns (can be a game common problem?)
The difficulty of the level of level is to pile up the number of monsters and blood without brains.
The material you need to use the firearm upgrade should be high, but the unlimited gun runs to fight high and it will be extremely painful.
Even if it is an upgraded gun, the value of the weapon cannot catch up with the growth rate of the enemy's blood volume
If the blood volume and attack power of the enemy are 20%of the blood, each level of weapons can only increase by 10%
It is much easier to get the ordinary difficulty level with the unlimited gun to hit the ordinary difficulty level than getting the upgraded gun and the difficult level.

Big Spaghet,1,17.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MassiveLinguini/,"The core game here is great. The enemy variety leaves a little to be desired, interface slightly clunky, and the side missions are (so far) inconsistent.

I am starting to hate the way they've tied health and armor systems into melee. Especially on higher difficulties it's just not feasible to regain health in certain fights.

Additionally the TE-style red/blue rings for dodges and parrys ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ suck. It feels like a duck tape solution to their wanting to implement dark souls-esque timing requiments while filling the screen with swarms of enemies. It becomes and annoying indecipherable mess.

Oh and the ammo replenishment mechanics do not work in boss fights that physically yank your camera away to LOOK AT BIRD when your trying to replenish ammo.

Good 40k game, but there's a lot of jank getting in the way of a great overall experience.

NicoBishop,1,11.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WakaWaka221/,"The latest 40k game that got tons of positive reviews before it was even released. It tells the story of how three and a half ultramarines defeated just a few million tyrranids and chaos followers. Again attached lobotomized psyker, chaos-thermo-lord-wizard, references to Lord of the Rings and, unlike the first part, not fapable IG girl.
This game, apparently, enough money, so we have:
The scenery in the game is exactly three kinds again: ruins in swamps, city, cemetery in the ruins. The only glimmer of light at the very end: the ruins of cemetery in a warp anomaly.
Enemies are also of three types: tyranids, chaosites, and demon. Though for each type are drawn special, pathos-busting animations of knocking out heresy.
Weapons compared to the tabletop redesigned just to the point of impossibility: from melta made shotgun, from laska sniper, from stormbolter dull machine gun, and from the jumping satchel evil machine unstoppable imba. And they didn't let me dabble in heavy weapons

1)The game presents genetically enhanced superhuman warriors as ordinary overgrown men in sealed lats.
2)Almost the entire game, while in the combat zone, the protagonists walk around without helmets (Strictly forbidden by the Codex Astartes). The phrase of the captain (!) of the Ultramarines (!!!) addressed to the sergeant “Why do you take the Codex Astartes so seriously?” is tantamount to breaking the oath of some Creed regiment.
3)The aforementioned captain, fighting with weapons the average SM would be ashamed of, in armor less flashy than the sergeant next to him.
4)Royals in bushes the size of a necron tomb.

However, in general, game came out not bad and even much more lore-friendly than 3rd DoW
--------------------------------------
Последняя игрушка по 40к, получившая кучу положительных оценок ещё до выхода. Повествует о том, как три с половиной ультрамарина победили всего-то несколько миллионов тирранидов и хаоситов. Опять прилагается лоботомированный псайкер, хаос-термо-лорд-волшебник, отсылки к Властелину Колец и, в отличии от первой части, не фапабельная ИГшница. Тем не менее, бабло на игру, видимо, хватило, в отличии от первой части, благодаря чему:

Декораций в игре ровно опять три вида: руины в болотах, город, кладбище в руинах. Единственный проблеск света в самом конце: руины кладбища в варп-аномалии.
Врагов тоже три вида: тираниды, хаоситы, демон. Хотя для каждого типа прорисованы особые, пафосные анимации вышибания ереси.
Оружие по сравнению с настолкой переработано просто донельзя: из мелты сделали дробовик, из лазки снайперку, из штормболтера унылый пулемет, а из прыжкового ранца злобную машину неостановимой имбы. И не дали побаловаться тяжелым оружием

Игра преподносит генетически улучшенных воинов-сверхлюдей, как обычных мужиков-переростков в герметичных латах.
Практически всю игру, находясь в зоне боевых действий, главные герои ходят без шлемов (Строжайше запрещено Кодексом Астартес). Фраза капитана (!) Ультрамаринов (!!!), обращённая к сержанту «А чего ты так серьёзно относишься к Кодексу Астартес?» равносильна нарушению присяги каким-нибудь кридским полком.
Упомянутый капитан, воюющий с оружием, которого постыдился бы и обычный десантник, в доспехе менее пафосном чем у сержанта рядом.
Рояли в кустах размером с упомянутый титан.

FuscusNight,1,77.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FuscusNight/,"It's pretty good, definitely not perfect as it comes with some flaws but it's a well done sequel to the first game.

Visuals
Game's visual aspect looks great, especially considering the absolute chaos you see happening on the screen with so many enemies swarming and things blowing up, with even small attention to detail existing such as the fact you get mud stains on your armour (and blood ofc) as you go through some of the marshy parts of the planet, it looks damn good but due to performance being somewhat shoddy, up scaling is needed which softens the image so people who can't stand temporal softness to an image will not be happy

Optimizaiton








I played through it solo on Veteran, my initial experience was a bit Luke-warm with the first few missions but it didn't take long for me to get more into it, especially since the campaign gets better as you progress it, early missions have this more frequent re-occurring issue that is present when you're playing solo, where certain segments feel like they're not meant for you to be on your own with the two AI partners that share a singular brain cell, such as for an example having to use a flame thrower to push back a swarm of tiny lil' insects whilst dealing with lots of ranged enemies and having to complete some objectives, problem is, the flamer takes you primary weapon away so all you're down to is your pistol for ranged enemies plus enemies in solo mode tend to focus more on the solo player than the two AI partners, so these situations can feel a bit bad . However , this starts becoming less so of a problem at the mid point of the campaign where it starts feeling like they put some more thought into making it more enjoyable when playing solo. The campaign as a whole is really damn good by the end, apart from some stumbles in design where it can very much feel like it's a Co-Op campaign with an optional solo mode from time to time, it's epic, doesn't over stay its welcome , ends on a pretty satisfying note with a spectacular final act fight that was incredibly kick a**.",2024/9/8,en

After the break is disconnected, I read the file directly to the previous archive point. Even I am offline. When loadingAlso try to join the server, whether it is cerebral palsy.
The action mode is also playing offline, and the online progress is not synchronized.

In the PVE action mode, the value of the bullets is not smelling. Basically, it is all toy gun scraping and pure garbage stuff. It looks better than a flashlight.And because WWZ still wonders not to explode, there will be a little penetrating or explosive damage. As a result, there is no hair, which is no different from ordinary bullets.
Interstellar warrior's performance in the game also belongs to the various settings of the official failure.

SiMBi0ZZA,0,14.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SiMBi0ZZA/,"The review is in early access version 0.3V

At the moment, 6 hours only in the plot company of the game.
I play a couple with a friend all the time after the prologue.
But even the game in the company did not save the game ...
I will update the review as the content is developed, but for now:
1) The combat system even from the fact that it is stated very little variability and content has the number of firearms/Combo attacks,
And add to this that of the 5th automatic differences there are no facts.
Just like the combo, it is not felt as a special feeling that except PKM/PKM/PKM is not needed.
And the “nodes” that should form the nucleus of the variety is not enough, and that there is even less, because it makes no sense even purely from “I want” just a 2 -or machine gun 3 or machine gun 3, well, there are no differences in sensations.
In the prologue, the game teaches you to parry and dodge you as well as the solo of the solo of the target, but then the game will throw in crowds throwing all enemies at you without analysis without trying to create interesting situations from different types of enemies in 88%of cases, only I remembered.The location where we hid behind the destroyed statues fired from snipers, this is the only interesting situation for 6 hours of the plot (did not pass and played)
Types of enemies only 5 and 2 bosses and so 5 hours before the appearance of chaosites, which, in fact, RESKINA, the only difference between the chaosites is that the big mobs of chaos (cosmodesant chaos) are able to teleport, otherwise they are identical to their analogues among tyranides.
As a result, the mission is a series of 1 -shaped porridge of 5 types of enemies sometimes 1 out of 2 bosses appear.

Listing trifles regarding the shortcomings of the combat system can not be enough for a review for a long time.

2) the plot is as if there is no Titus, all the characters besides the Titus of a dummy of neither a character nor a person, no interesting dialogues or kitszen, chemistry between ordinary and title in the 1st part when they argued on Astartes Code more than chemistry between Titus and all characters2ki taken together, and this is not hyperbole, just in this scene in 1 chemistry there was a conflict that laid the foundation of the plot, and in 2 there simply no plot or dialogues of any interest in the narrative, drama is not familiar to the developers of the game from the word completely.
Even when there were times when you expect the most logical paths in the framework of the situation, they were not.
It seems that the whole plot wrote and directed the neural network, and once again it is not hyperbole, this is 1 in 1 so.

3) I have the optimization of iron above the recommended, I am not a stab me, I am not a graphodr () I put it on low schedule.I have 2070Super/i5 9600/16ram 3200. And at the same time, I have FPS stably jumps from 40 to 60, and I understand those scenes where a large location is a bunch of enemies and allies, but why does the FPS fall in corridor locations?On low.
Low, my iron 4 years ago was the forerunner Consider especially Vidyakh, and here the game that does not stand out at low ones falls into the FPS, and in some places the Federal Penitentiary Service fell up to 16 Tsati, I'm afraid to imagine what kind of slide show on minimal specified requirements.

I still have a lot to say but not fit in the review, but I voiced the main claims.

If you are far from wahi and you do not care about the canon, for you this is just a casual bad game with low variability and a yawn plot.

If you are assigned a 20 -year -old exposure like me, who has at least 200 hours of podcasts listened and reading/codes, it will hurt you from nonsense on the backing.

And if you are a hired expert Back, take care of your heart, I'm afraid to imagine how it hurts you.

Do not buy a game for a full price tag, you do not miss anything without playing it, you should not take this game for less than 75%of the OV, although even so it is not worth money, it is better to go on import substitution.

LionSaurus,1,87,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005529409/,"Solid enough game - it does what it says on the tin - be a giant super human and smack bugs around. Story seems fun so far, operations are good (but with a caveat) and I like the melee and gunplay. After some more time in the game (both story and operation) I can delve a bit deeper into things.

Story - 7/10. It's pretty straight forward, though there might be a twist or turn in there (that I'm sure you have already gotten spoiled through various news media anyway). Not much to say. Simple, but cool.

World building - 10/10. Top marks. The maps, the battlefields, the chaos, the swarms, the absolute gore - it's just fantastic. It's beautiful and disturbing and just beyond anything I expected. Game teaches you about the 40k world and the immersion it provides gets you really stuck into it making you want to know more.

Gameplay - 9/10. Gameplay is marvelous. Though I'm still struggling with the timing of dodges and parries I've occasionally gotten in a flow where I just become a blender, chopping xeno scum to the left, doding xeno scum to the right, and firing of headshots as quick reaction. I for sure need to get better at the combat flow, but I can easily see how good it can be if you get good at it and once you do it's going to be euphoric.

Operations - 8/10, but with a caveat. The mainstay of the game in my opinion. It has huge potential and even the little I've played is so much fun. It reminds me of the golden days of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer (if you know, you know). However the biggest issue is playing without a full team - because you are stuck trying to connect with random players and that is it's own bag of worm. From people with bad connection, to people who won't go to the mission area, to people who just afk. I honestly prefer having bots over the random players, but unfortunately you can't choose to add bots - you have to hope nobody tries to join. The fact that we can't add bots makes me want to subtract 2 points from the score on it's own because the issues with random players can be very aggravating. They need to add an option to add bots..

Endless War - haven't played =p Might try it some day, but not a big PvP so - check others opinion on this game mode.

Would I recommend? I think, yes. If you enjoy the concept of loop gameplay from operations, and you have a full team (or the devs add option to add bots) I think you will have a blast. I know I will once I'm done with the random player issues.

Oh, and a final note. Stay away from the ultimate edition and cosmetic DLC's and all that. Even if you pay for it you still have to unlock it. So you buy for the right to unlock the cosmetics, but you still have to spend requisition on it which takes super long to grind. My biggest regret is paying for the ""cosmetic options"" I don't have enough points to unlock lol.",2024/9/7,en

The addition of easy drop-in, drop-out for co-op was fantastic. Visuals were wayyy better than I expected and might be one of the nicest looking games I've ever played (at the time of this writing? lmao).
The only gripe I have is with the lack of information presented for pvp. It took quite a while to get into my first match and I had no idea if I was actually gonna get in since it gave me no indication besides ""Waiting for other Battle Brothers"" in a full lobby. Turns out I was waiting for the match that I joined to end... I think. It would also be nice to have one sentence explaining each of the pvp modes. Switching armor parts instead of choosing a chapter was also confusing.
Other than that, I loved playing through the story, can't wait to get the squad together for Operations, and I'm super happy this game exists!",2024/9/11,en

Shrimpy,1,94.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040086041/,"I Like it but thats not the whole story..
Space Marine 2 is well set in the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K. As a continuation of the OG Space Marine Game from 2011, it attempts to bring the one-decade old formula of bolter shooting and chainsawsword slashing to 2024. However, it struggles to do so and is very expensive on top. I really enjoy playing the game and will most likely cotinue to play it. But it has some notable flaws and if you are thinking about buying the game you should consider the following.


If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k and a sucker for the (totally not overrepresented) Ultra Marines, its a awesome implementation in the Universe.
The game is a well representation (even if a little generalized) of the lore and atmosphere that makes up the core of 40k for me. It allows you to stomp Tyranids and match yourself with . In the Coop PVE and the PVP mode, the Customization System allows you to tailor your Character into your favorite Space Marine Chapter or Chaos Legion. The Lovecraftian horrors of the 40k universe are well-represented, making the story engaging despite its somewhat bleak plot and dialogue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, if you're not deeply invested in the 40k Universe, Space Marine 2 falls short. The gameplay feels outdated, with clunky mechanics that haven't evolved much since the original game . Combat can be fun, but it's often repetitive and lacks the refinement seen in other smilar modern titles. The writing is another weak point, with dialogue that ranges from uninspired to outright poor. Online multiplayer is plagued by long wait times, frequent connection errors, and bugs that, for example, can make enemies invisible (very fun), breaking immersion and gameplay. The game has a very hard time to offer anything beyond its niche appeal, making its steep tag hard to justify for newcomers to the world of 40K aswell as casual players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Space Marine 2 delivers exactly what I want out of a Warhammer 40k game: a grimdark experience in a universe that lacks hope with the permanent thread of extinction for a human race lost in endless external and internal conflict. However, it struggles to appeal beyond its core audience due to outdated gameplay, technical issues, and blunt writing. If you're a diehard fan of 40k, you'll find enjoyment in this game despite its flaws. For everyone else, who just want to stomp some Aliens and blow up stuff, there are better and less expensive options.",2024/9/11,en

A distinctive feature of any game for me is a gameplay and here it is below the average.Maybe because I played at normal it seemed to me.Fortunately, the game passes in 10 hours maximum.In the end, of course, you accelerate and you are already quickly pressing the ksenos and chaosites on the quitim, even starts to like it.

But I would like the depths: unique finished off, skills, passwinds, even the tasks of the type kill 200 opponents from a fighting knife - all the same 2024 in the yard.And how many noticed the game was made according to the instructions of 2010.

But what is actually good in the game is the cool setting.Katsen and rollers at the proper level.The story is unpretentious and simple, but at the same time it is capable of captivating.

Trendered so that you are immersed straight.I would like to yell in the battle ""In the name of the emperor!"", When you go together with Astra Militarum into battle.With take the adept of mechanicus for swagger.

Companions are registered heroes, not blanks, which pleases.You even get to them.

The plot of my reverence and the elderly pleased, continuing the old convoy about the artifact.And with a fanbase, showing tyranids, the combat equipment of the imperium, chaosites, and Necron ruins are flirting.And to beginners, too, it seems to be more or less clear what we are talking about.The base is in a word.

Cartoon, well, he is.Why?Well, to those who are not enough wiha in life, probably.

Justro,1,23.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slayerjustro666/,"This is by far my GOTY contender for 2024. I will not argue with people who don't agree for stupid reasons. The story is so stupidly incredible and epic. It fits perfectly for a Warhammer 40k game. The gameplay can at times be a little yanky and rough but is for the most part perfectly great and fun. Ripping a tyranid open from the middle and being drenched in its blood never gets old.

The operations game mode is so much fun, playing as my own space marine completing missions really is amazing. Even replaying the same missions doesn't get old.

The pvp game mode is the best pvp in any game I have ever played. I never liked playing pvp until I tried it in this game. However it is a bit unbalanced as some classes are absolute dogsh*t in pvp. Or at least on some gamemodes. I'm sure it will improve.

The customization is incredible, all that I am missing is more customization for heretic factions, which I don't doubt will come later considering how many people want it.

The only complaints for this game I have seen are: No widescreen support (Which will come to the game in september, just check the roadmap) , Oh I don't wanna connect to epic games services (Doesn't make the game bad, and is only there so you can play crossplay), The AI companions are so bad that I can't play the campaign solo (Literally a skill issue???)
This is finally a game that is not pay to win and it is clear that the devs reallly care about the game. In my eyes this game is joining baldurs gate 3 for being an actually good game in modern times. Yes some cosmetics will cost money, but all other content coming to the game is free. So people need to stop complaining about this game, because it is simply breathtaking.

In summary, this game is worth every penny. I bought Ultra Edition instead of Gold Edition even if it only gives me a cool cosmetic for Ultramarines (and I really dislike ultramarines) but I still don't regret it. I would have bought this game if it cost $150 base edition. Good that it doesn't but still, It is worth the money to me personally. Now keep in mind, I love warhammer 40k and have done for a while so I am a bit biased. But for a Warhammer 40k fan, this game is like the game of my dreams. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? BUY IT NOW!

This game has so many little details that have made me and my friends stop and appreciated them (not mentioning which in order to avoid spoiling).

The gameplay is visceral and responsive, simple to pick up but with some dept to it.
The lore, according to my more learned friends as I am but a novice in the 40k ways, is very good, and they took great care with some details.
And the graphics are beautiful, the contrast between the amazing visceral displays in combat and the beautiful but war thorn landscape around is amazing.

This topped off with non-predatory monetisation, only cosmetics can be bought, and even then there are plenty to earn in game, the future updates are free and will bring so many wonderful things is such a breath of fresh air.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a very old-fashioned linear game, where there is a plot campaign for 10 hours, a separate multiplayer and cooperative mode.The main thing is that the developers managed to correctly convey the atmosphere of Warhammer 40,000.Brutal battles, monumental structures and a pressing gloomy atmosphere with pathos conversations about brotherhood and faith.All this in concentrated form is constantly present on the screen.It is no less important that the authors managed to combine the mechanics of shooting and close combat, as well as design combat situations so that the game does not lose the feeling of freshness to the final.It is very difficult to evaluate this game somehow otherwise than ""this is the real Warhammer.""",2024/9/11,ru

From the experience that started playing since Day 1 ** Model in advance **
This is an adventurous action game that shows the best role at this time. If talking about the advantages and disadvantages of this game:

strength
- Graphic system: Step ""impressed without disappointment.""
Due to following up from this game announcement, including the Demo gameplay system advertisement
This is ** the first game in my life. ** I feel that there is no downgrade.
""How did Demo come !!The real game comes like that !! ""

- Story system: There is a lot of Hype.
The team did the said system.In a very large scaleMake players feelThere is a mood with the game easily.

All forms of fun
The team did the homework very well. With the form and theme of this universe, all came.


Definitely not disappointed, intelligent and challenging
As the same team as Crysis 2, Killing Floor 2 and
See the name and know

Decorated until it was flawless
Very diverseIf anyone is already a fan of this universe already, say ""Fin, like*2""

Like watching a movieThat we can control the characters
""The sound of guns and ammunition at the enemy's body"", ""The sound of a sword at the enemy of the enemy"", ""
Including the voice of the characters that are emotional with the event
Everything

This game has a Thai lecture system.Do not worry about translation in all situations.

:
Although the universe of this gameIs definitely greater than helldivers 2
But the story system of this game that emphasizes that there are still only the Tyranids tribe
On the other hand, helldivers 2



When playing for a long timeWill start to feel boredBecause the mission is still not diverse enough
(Depending on each playerAnd wait for the next update)

There are only a few, such as sponsoring the enemy, etc.
(But it is considered very few in Day 1 if compared to other games)

There is a good translationBut still not excellentSome words are used.That does not match the situation
Such as military vocabulary, tactics, sentences or idioms that should be
(I would like to admire the team very much and hope that this component will be useful to the team in the development.)

- If going to play this game: emphasizing that according to the System Requirements
(Personal experience is open, the story is outstanding, the game is completely out of the game)



But if anyone likes Heavy Bolter Skin + Ultramarine Skin
Plus 300 baht to get Ultra Edition

Ai_shuang,1,32.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198286835015/,"Today, in 2024, the IP of War Hammer has spent decades like the history of the whole video game. In the process, many types of games of the Warhammer series have also been born, such as the full war of war hammers, the doomsday plague,, Dark tide and so on.As the level of the standard gaming industry, this Star Warrior 2 has also set another major tools for the Warhammer series games.I have to say that the IP of the Warhammer is very lucky. Regardless of the subsequent operation of the dark tide and Star warrior 2, the overall quality of the game is really high.



This interstellar warrior 2 points into 3 modes. The battle mode Players play the Tempus team to end the enemy's conspiracy in the 8th war.Different tasks of the same battle are performed. This model has a professional and weapon RPG system, and it also undertakes the elements of brushing in the game.The last is a PVP mode without numerical growth. The built -in level is only used to unlock weapon use permissions.



The overall design of this game is actually very traditional. The three modes are completely separated. Each performs its duties.As a result, when I encountered an accident and entered the story of this article, I became a small captain. There were two less obedient teammates who performed a variety of smaller tasks in the big events.At the same time, each level is plugged into some big scenes and multi -performance scripts that are increasingly rare today.In the process, the protagonist and teammates were slowly displayed, and finally faced a decisive battle in the face of the big crisis.This is also a feature of the old ASS game. Even if the process is spoiled before the game, when you really play, you can still feel excited and trembling when you hear these things, these characters, these large -scale scenes happen in front of them.



At the same time, there are many classic interpretations of the Warhammer's series in the battle. Players who are familiar with the IP are afraid that they can already imagine the development direction of the story before they start, but the plot of the masterpiece who has never been exposed to the war hammer is also very simple and direct.It is very eliminated by the previous cause of the consequences. There is no need to buy novels and comics to understand the plot's riddle design. There is no great understanding of the cost. It is very friendly to outsiders.For Hammer's details, the game is full of details. For example, in the process, the door that the star army cannot be lifted by the Star Warriors will make the Hammer smile, and this performance can be in other players.Simply see the strength of the protagonist.



There are also various classic war hammer links, such as Qibing, Guishan, a classic plot: The Extreme Legion of Grand Rican in the genetically preliminaries, the ICU war god, the blue man, the whole galaxy of the Galaxy,The hardest man, the electric pole holding the space of the space of the space as a weapon, the dry explosion of Tyron's nest owner, the one punch to kill the god of war, the two punching Angolas dog meat, the two hearts of the chaotic sacred place, the super rush man——Aarga!(His stretcher team) debut!Single -up!




The sense of blow and control of the game itself is also very top -level, so that players really think that what we control is a 3 -meter -high super brother, whether it is the walking posture caused by the huge armor or various melee weapons to fight on the Terlen Zerg.How powerful can players feel how powerful our fists of these 300,000 horsepower are.
The game itself's combat system is also very unique. The advantages of playing games such as wolf are integrated into this game. Of course, if you play with key mouse and mouse, you must change all the keys except WASD.In the battle, we have two explosive shotguns and a melee weapon to reduce the blood volume of the enemy to a certain degree after a certain degree.The invincible state rushed up to perform a happy execution animation, and a very good setting was to cancel all actions and shake before execution.At the same time, there is also a player mechanism in the game. The enemy attacks two types: red and blue. When you are attacked, you will see a blue light effect first.Anti -success, the middle judgment frame is relatively abundant. In addition to a few consecutive attacks, we need to play twice, at this time we can shoot directly into the state of the gun, but since the gun decision is remote execution, it is also reasonable to delete the invincible effect.EssenceAt the same time, the point that is not mentioned in the game is that the red attack can also be perfectly dodge and then the gun decisions, and all mobs attacks in this game can be played. Therefore, theoretically, it is theoretically. In theory, we can only use melee.Still my round battle.



Then other designs determine that this set of mechanisms cannot run perfectly. For example, the cost of a worm in the Terren worm is not as expensive as a bullet.When the soldiers surrounded the surrounding enemies and the long -range soldiers that could only be resolved with guns, they also used a bouncing knife in some gaps.Although it is easy to bombs, it is also necessary to consider the risk of failure. In the game, players' attacks and attacks are too hard, and often face the surrounding situation. No matter what difficulty, sometimes a operation error will be dead.This has also led players to rarely use this ability without proficiency.



However, the game itself is very encouraged to fight. Our interstellar warrior first has a shield. No matter what you execute, you can directly reply to the shield.After the shield is broken, the blood first is the deficiency blood. Similar attacks with the blood can directly reply to the deficiency blood, and the deficiency of this game is one to one and the time is not short. Sometimes you hit the mob in the strange pile.How much I sucked back.



However, this game has stuffed a lot of long -range monsters in the level of the level, allowing many of the above -mentioned combat methods to lose room, and the long -range monster attack frequency and accuracy of this game are not low.However, there is a setting to kill the long -range elite. The mobs next to the mobs will die by themselves. However, this tutorial is hidden in the PVE character challenge. At this time, the production team may be the hammer.The younger brothers around the big tools will die.



And the production team fills the value with the foot. At present, some weapons are very balanced, and the hot melt is destroyed. The energy weapons in the world's view are effective in this game.The most difficult monster giant meat, AI and AI during the war of AI, do nothing, but 80%of the injury reduction can not die.However, the battle is generally recommended to play low difficulty, which is also in line with the intensity of the original star soldiers. After all, there will be no other rewards except for achievements.If you really want to challenge the difficulty, you still go to the PVE mode. After all, PVE must be difficult to upgrade in the future. Do not start the battle directly to the jail like me. In this process, you will also appreciate the script performance during the battle.



The production team of the level design is still more in the zombie world war. Many levels have a very strong sense of vision. Generally, it is not very good, and the level is quite satisfactory.However, some level design is a bit dung. For example, there is a level in the middle that needs to be held by Peng Teller to defend in the mouse pile. In the case of a huge long -range monster, you need to use the fireproofer to burn the ground from time to time to place the mechanism.The name AI teammate is even more painful. AI has nothing to do. The output and the header can only be handed over to the player themselves.




The rendering style of this game is very unique and incomplete, especially the armor of the Star Warrior, which is more like using various shadow spraying and making old battle flags.Look at it for a long time.In PVE and PVP, players can also customize armor. At this time, the color of the game civil war group is consistent with the color name of the flag paint in reality.Maybe this is also a business strategy, but in general, it is not bad.



However, some issues of this work are also introduced here. At present, the first version of the battle and 6 levels of PVE, each level is about an hour, and many colors of custom armor need to spend the game in the game for purchasing in the game, and the game of the game, and the game, and the purchase of the game in the game.This token demand is very large. At present, the content of 6 levels in the area is really difficult to support the players' long brush, and the follow -up armor style of each occupation in PVE needs to be unlocked.If you want to unlock the full unlock at least 204 PVEs, this is really exaggerated. Obviously, unlocking the armor of each occupation into a general can reduce the amount of more than half of the content. Unfortunately, the production team did not choose this.



The PVP of this work is more traditional, nor is it the focus of the production team. Many functions do not want to do it. For exampleYou can also wear a shield directly. Generally speaking, the depth is not high, but I am more worried that when I play PVP on the first day, I encounter plug -in. I want to report but find that there is no report method in the game. I encounter this situation.You can only choose to exit, but there is no punishment for exit.It can only be said that the little blue bear specially added by the production team is not very useful for this PVP. After all the dust is settled, the PVP should not be played by everyone except for everyone.



However, it is worth mentioning that after experiencing the dark tide, I first had high expectations for the music of this game, but after the actual opening of the game, you asked me the music of Star Warrior 2. I found that I couldn't remember what the music of this game was at all.It looks, but the sound effect of the relative game is very good. The large -caliber of the shotgun is a large -caliber break, and the impact sound of the internal institution of the firearm.There is also a very detailed place that players can choose whether to bring helmets in the settings, which will also directly affect the role dialogue sound effects.



In general, this game is a very standardized product of the game industry. It has normal level design, a more unique combat system, and lack of combat design experience leads to a slightly higher strength of the long -range mobs.At the same time, I have invested more compromised resources, and there should be a real hammer to provide ideas in the production team. This resource is really spent on the blade.Perform madly; know that if you do n’t do much, then stack the relevant design densely within 7 hours of the battle; know what the hammer wants to see, then focus on this aspect;, Show the whole story in the eyes of the player in a very clear attitude.This is very valuable in today's European and American game industry.",2024/9/8,zh-cn
