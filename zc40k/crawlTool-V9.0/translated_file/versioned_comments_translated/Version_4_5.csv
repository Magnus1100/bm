A1SOR,1,77.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ALSOR/,"I knocked out all Achivka and thesis I tell about Space Marine 2

The irony is that I hate to knock out acerification, platinum and that's all.Only in exceptional cases when the gameplay is too much like.Usually I just go through the game and do not even open a list of available achievements.

But in this case, something went wrong.From the game I just did not want to come off.Well, I decided that since I was dependent in it, why not knock out everything that is in it.Happiness is that all that you need to do is just play.Exceptions are several academicians to collect audiologists and ""kill something while it does something there.""But there are few of them, so there was no need to be distracted from the zarub.

Well, after this, I want to briefly summarize my expirence.


The first thing that catches the eye when starting the game is the picture.In particular - qualitatively worked out backs and environment.Technologically, the game does not offer something supernatural.What can not be said about magnificent architecture and interiors, about brutal battles occurring against the background and about close attention to details.The artists tried perfectly, because all this sets the necessary mood.


Namely, the mood for the ongoing action, where a spectacular slasher with a simple combo system and a good third-person shooter, makes a SM2 combat system in some way, are made in equal proportions.









Levels in PVE and in the campaign cannot boast of complexity and branching.However, this never had great importance to me in the games of this genre.The most important thing is that LVV-design play the hands of the main systems and does not interfere with the game to be a fan.So it works in SM2.The maximum where you can turn from the main road is for audio loses, but for a couple of ammunition boxes and temporary improvements for armor.Otherwise, the game does not interfere with the most important - endless meat grinder.And this is great.


For my happiness, I went through the game in a duo-coope.And this game works perfectly in this mode.The bots in the game are incredibly stupid and all that they are capable of is to raise a fallen Timmate.And then not always.From the point of view of their combat effectiveness and benefit in the implementation of joint tasks, everything is bad here.So my advice is to you-play with at least one friend, and ideally in a full-style.

Incredibly primitive, laughter, pathos and if you are not a fan of the universe, then this will probably be the weakest aspect for you.However, to say that he was completely failed - I also can’t: the game is trying to intrigue, the development of characters and even try to surprise with Cliffhanger, who will be understandable only to those who played in the first part.In general, the plot here is a pure function, which is a justification for an ongoing meat grinder.

Separately, I want to highlight the solution of developers to make a narrative to tie the main plot and PVE operation.While Titus is dealing with the most important things, somewhere in the background other guys decide something secondary, which helps the main team.It turns out an interesting interweaving.At the same time, no one forbids to go through the PVE mission, and then the plot.To some extent, this may even affect the perception of the main story.",2024/11/28,ru

Introduction

Captain Titus, as a punishment for the ""death guard"", returns to regular service.You slip into the role of Lieutenant Titus, the empire needs you, the tyrannies and a much more powerful enemy threaten humanity.You fight yourself through true hordes of opponents and also have to justify yourself for your past.

Gameplay

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 divides into three areas.As a loyal soldier of the empire, of course, you first face the unfortunately too short story.In individual missions you can improve your class and equipment.The classic PvP mode then throws you in the fight for the title of the deadliest Space Marine.

I don't want to tell anything about the story itself.I definitely want to write two things.The story is told in action -packed scenes and in German.Unfortunately, unfortunately, she is told far too quickly.In general, graphics and sound leave a very good impression in the game.

In story mode you fight in a three man squad against true opponents.The NPC Marines do a good job, they know the way, but you can't really get lost, and lead one or two revival if Titus jumped into a group of opponents too quickly.The NPC Marines can also be replaced or configured by real players.The weapons can be adapted before each mission, but there are enough weapons and ammunition between the entire corpse.There is a change here and there, but you can tell that.

In addition to the story mode, individual missions can be played.Here you can choose from different classes and then equip them with suitable weapons.However, no NPCs are intended here, you need human comrades for fighting.If you start a mission alone, the game assigns you human team members and the slaughter can begin.

The PvP mode is exactly what it sounds.As the real soldier of the imperator, however, I do not fight against my own comrades!


Unfortunately I have to open a very dark chapter here.At times I was so far to write a negative review and not recommended Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2.Anyone who has read so far knows that the story is very important to me, just stupid that game has crashed in almost every sequence.So the game had to be restarted and played again to this point in order to be able to skip the sequence that was then re -established.

The fact that the lumbar churse and even the metal lock on the arm of Titus in the elevator, which is very, very slowly moved, is thrown upwards is of course only a little thing against the crashes.But I thought it was funny, so I didn't want to leave it unmentioned.



Top story told
Endless
Many different weapons
good German voice output
great graphic


Regular crashes of the intermediate sequences
Much too short story






A well told story with very good graphics and a top sound including a coherent German voice output.The battle around the universe cannot be managed better.But stop!Of course, it would be even better without the crashes.I tested the game on two computers and with several graphics cards, unfortunately without success.I still recommend the game and will write here whether the problem is fixed.",2024/11/18,de

l33tn3ss_17,1,16.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/l33tn3ss17/,"Space Marine 2 is a must-buy game that harkens back to the politics-free heyday of gaming. It is like taking a time machine back to the 2010s and going through all those beautifully made games during that era. It also shows how far AAA gaming has fallen. All publishers and development teams should take note and do better, focusing primarily on player experience over 'sending the message' and monetization. Saber Interactive should be very proud of what they have made.

If, like me, you are disappointed with the needless disrespect towards canon and established lore by Games Workshop lately, then you need not fear Space Marine 2. Space Marine 2 follows the story of Captain Titus in a way that respects what has been and does not cater to the tourists and nu-Warhammer fans destroying the hobby currently. Any true Warhammer fans can buy Space Marine 2 guilt-free.

The single-player campaign is long enough to provide a story that ties into the Era Indomitus and the previous story of the first Space Marine game. Playing it solo can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, but I found it to be well worth playing and had very few issues with it even though I finished it on early patches.

Playing Operations solo is also likewise a very meaningful experience that you cannot replicate elsewhere. I am ecstatic that Saber Interactive is continuing to develop more missions for this mode. The mission where you kill the Bio-Titan is my new favourite. I have had a few drops when I played it, but otherwise, I have not had any major issues.

Multiplayer is fun, but I still think the Bulwark class is overpowered, and some balancing is necessary. It is not a mode I have played a ton, but I can report no major issues.

A huge bonus is that the usual suspects hate Space Marine 2 and its success:



Another bonus is that the CEO of Saber Interactive is incredibly based:



As is some of their dev team:



I give Space Marine 2 a very solid 9/10, only citing some minor technical issues in Operations mode. Space Marine 2 is my game of the year this year on Steam, and I highly encourage anybody to buy it. Whether this is your first or tenth Warhammer game, this is a worthy buy and entry into the grimdark universe of 40k. Well done to Saber Interactive.",2024/11/28,en

Here the co-op shines bringing a variety of weapons and classes of Space Marines so that we can complete the missions, which can be thrown solo or two friends (with friends is better).

I expected that he would quickly get tired due to a small amount of so far available cards, but surprisingly the gameplay game is so good that I did not notice how I played 250+ hours and I think this is not the limit.
This product is able to give emotions that, unfortunately, the majority of modern games either cannot give, or are afraid because of the ""agenda"" and the fear of someone to hurt or offend.Space Marine 2 is a third -person shower overwhelmed by pathos and brutality with excellent customization, beautiful and detailed graphics, an attentive attitude to the lorus of the universe and interesting gameplay.
Nothing will replace the first sensation from the murdered xenos with its big n ******* !!!(As a pillar of course, what have you thought out?)
In general, developers promise to support the project and add new cards and weapons.The direction is true, but I would also like more variations of enemies.Over time, I hope that they will come to this.Add conditional necrons or orcs for example.
Well, otherwise:

OliveWizard,1,39.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/olivewizard/,"During the thoughts of the best games of 2024, two options come to my mind: HELLDIVERS 2 and Space Marine 2. Both there and there, the super -soldiers of the future exterminate giant beetles from distant space, but Sony again confirmed the title of ""offices"", so today I write only todayAbout Space Marine 2 as a game of the year.

The game is old -fashioned.It is made according to the formula from the zero: each self -respecting blockbuster should have a ten hour campaign, multiplayer and cooperative.But precisely because now they do not make such games, it is felt by a sip of fresh air.I also did not even have problems with bugs and the technical condition at the start.

It disappears from my head immediately after passing, but I remember exactly that it passed it literally with an open mouth.This is the most reliable Warhammer at the moment.Familiar from the books of the construction of a planetary scale and countless hordes of enemies are here and they are made with the maximum scale and details.Therefore, my space marineer for a long time did not run towards the goals of the missions, but painstakingly studied every meter of hives.

It was clearly not created as the main mode.But like the old parts of Call of Duty allows you to just have fun to run and shoot.Short matches, small cards, instant revival, funny phrases, rewards for each action.The old kind classic of the times of games in Jewel for a hundred.

Make a sweat.The path to the maximum level is a heavy rise to the top.You get in the face, rise, raise the levels of weapons and class, learn to play and begin to feel more confident at this level of difficulty.Then you go to the next level and ... already at the very beginning of the mission, the game puts you in place.You are nobody again, go learn to play.Sooner or later, you get to the last, fifth level of complexity, which will become a complicated test of your skills.Maybe you will not master it, but by that time at least you are pumping weapons and skills.
And then it turns out that you pumped only one class and one set of weapons.All the others need to download in the same way from scratch.And in the game only 6 (after updating 7) missions.You need to go through time after time.Do you know what madness is?This mode is too slow progression.

In general, I recommend trying Space Marine 2 even to those who are not a fan of the Warhammer 40 000 universe. It is beautiful, unusual, challenges and rewards for overcoming it.In addition, this is a game from ""our"" developers.These come out infrequently, but always delight.If this is not a turmoil, lol (but it is difficult to call it a game).

SeiEhrlich,1,36.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052283558/,"Introduction
Space Marine 2 - exciting, saturated and, most importantly for me, not a protracted adventure
both for one player and for the company of friends, because you can go through the trip.There are three types of content in the game:
The campaign is the story of Titus and its two comrades;
Operations - additional tasks that tell about the adventures of other members of the detachment, simultaneously performing their tasks.There is a pumping of equipment and classes, but I don't think,
That this can directly tighten, unless the combat system has sunk into your soul, but at least all the missions are worth passing once.
The eternal war is a multiplayer against other players, where 6 by 6 hard workers fight against each other.Honestly, I didn’t really like it, because I am not a fan of PVP content, but I do not exclude that someone likes it.

The game is an action from a third person with distortion into a near battle, as the damage
From long -range weapons, on average, below, but you should not forget about it, because not every enemy will run away with a headlong.
In close combat, you have to realize simple combinations of blows and fend off,
But do not worry, here you are not games and the attack will kindly illuminate and give enough time to the reaction.Also, enemies do not hesitate to use strong attacks that are not parked,
But you can dodge them, however, where you could fend the enemy at any time of the animation of the attack of your character, then you can dodge, as if only after the animation ended, which caused me problems.
It is possible to treat our cosmomoriac, unlike the first part, you can first first -aid kit or manage to make up for lost health in a short period of time by beating the enemy in the manner of the Bloodborne game.

The graphics in the game were admired, as well as the design of levels made with love for the universe.Many details in the animation of the characters, finishing enemies, covering armor with blood and dirt are a direct delight.The sensation of blows and firing is handed over well, as well as work with the sounds of weapons is done great, but, unfortunately, the enemies are felt, sometimes like lips for damage, which destroys immersion in the role of the strongest soldiers of the emperor.

Honestly, it’s hard for me to say, because I do not have advanced iron, but on RTX 2070, Ryzen 5 3600, 16 GB of RAM with a frequency of 3200 MHz I received ~ 45 frames in saturated bloody battles on Full HD monitor with medium graphics settings and dlss includedIn balance.
In general, it suited me and played it, quite, normal, taking into account the general quality of the picture.

First of all, I want to take the work of servers here.Their work for me remains a mystery.In operations
With random people, I received a ping of European servers, which was quite happy, but passing the campaign with a friend that lives near me, I could get as much as 600, which cited me
In a stupor.So because of this, the sound path in the cats could lag behind.Most likely, this problem was solved, but I ran into her and I cannot but mention.

The pumping in operations, in my opinion, is tightened, because in addition to pumping the class, it is necessary to pump each type of weapon separately, which is exhausted, but the weapon is divided into 4 classes of rarity and you cannot so calmly go through the maximum difficulty having the first or second rarity in the equipment of the character.

Summarizing, I want to say that the game is definitely worth playing in it, even if you are not a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe.In my opinion, you can get a unique experience that is not comparable with other games, except that only a DOOM series of games comes to mind, but this is different a bit.",2024/11/28,ru

Rory,1,196.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198153189020/,"The game of the bomb, I do not regret the 5K spent on this masterpiece.
The game in the Angel of Death gives you a certain test.which you can pass if you have straight hands.
The company itself is a fire, you just run along the locations that were worked out as much as possible to the smallest details, I still remember how the commissioner raised the fighting spirit to his guys, the amazing Loka of the necrons, straight to the goosebumps, when he was on the approach and saw symbols and began to guess whatA huge ass was excavated by the Martian mother of their geniuses.And the scene with the flag ..... I literally smiled, how cool it was.
Operations in the game are also beautiful, especially if you go parallel to the plot, because all this is intertwined.The fighting brothers are thrown by interesting remarks that give a plus of wyb for those who rummage in the topic, and of course, the expanses reveal the character of spaceships and a bit of their life.
The developers are also handsome, in the subject they clearly understand the smallest details, and clearly watch what the players write about the game.

But there is always ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyway.These are disadvantages.
So, let's start just with the fact that the game is very, very many whiners, because if there were few of them, then it is unlikely that the outfits were nervous recently out of just a couple of days.
It was really insulting, since at least some Chelenga appeared in the game because the game really experienced you and your brothers for strength because before that the game has become an Isi even on the existing Max, we literally ran out at 2 snoutsMisses with non -nuclear classes and guns, and when we saw a new difficulty ... It was cool, and the reward ... It was worth my brothers.And so we went through everything on new complexity pretty much, especially thanks to the Chaosites (I hate these creatures (but loving)), we are laughing as a kind part of the players cry and whine, which is too complicated and go unrealistic and they came to the game for Fun, and they came to the game for FunThis is not Fun at all, you can certainly say -“Put the moron of the difficulty lower than once.”, So they want to unlock everything in the game, they just don’t want to learn, the main thing is that they are given to the stupid fun, only these whiners are givenThey will not be able to know that joy when you go through this very stage of complexity and understand that now you yourself have actually become an angel of death.
Well done, too, well done, in the stupid they listened to these nonsense and naranfili the difficulty in the trash, it is very sad, of course, but now we and the brothers have passed the first days of the 5th difficulty will remember this and every time to say as old grandfathers, it used to be better.

Well, you can still say about PVP in this game, but I do not want to, since it is a rudimentary shit, we bend your fingers:
The balance has come out and smokes on the sidelines (thanks that at least the vanguard is subordinate)
Grenades are represented in 4 types opening along the pumping, but the most usable is shocking as: 1) control of a huge zone in the form of damage, which still does not lady the owner, meanwhile, the operation transfers greetings for such jokes 2) Blind literally until the end of your life 3) The fierce slowed down.In this one grenade, there is more meaning than in the others
The matchmaking of which is not, here you can still remember the balance because the weapon that opens with the rank humiliates in the trash, yes, yes Melta and plasma, I'm talking about you
Cards, what about cards?They are beautiful to horror, exactly like small and thanks to respowed per second, when I stood on an enemy home, I thought that I was fighting with a bunch of tyranids, not spaceport.And there are few cards
The close battle in the PVP shit for the one who was the first to hit, and the so -called parrying does not work, and even if he worked, then hello random ping in the team A and B.
Speaking of classes, a slight deviation from the humiliation of PVP in the game, there is a feeling that the game has normal classes, cool classes and an attack aircraft, here is the attack aircraft - this is the most hated creation of developers, it has humiliated it in this part, my friend almost cried.
There are many aspects for which you can still scold the game, but I will not, because playing this mode on serious droves, and even more so solo is unlikely to be.

Castomiz is straight a cool, if you do not take into account that the game has colors that are not stupidly displayed as they should, as an example, in the game there is no normal black in the game, then a half-black dull shit I refuse to take for a full-fledged black, a gold of a normal person recentlyOnly added, well, the symbolism is monstrously little, but it will be corrected with time, and in general - a bomb.

The result of sowing the seedlings

Some of that classic Halo DNA must be in this game, because I wasn’t so hooked with and online PvE mode since the original Halo ODST firefight mode.

Without taking into account the excellent campaign mode (LEAD ME TO THE SLAUGHTER) and the PvP, I’ve already sink +100 hours playing Operations Mode in all difficulty levels. Each time you finish an operation, you get points, new armor, weapons, perks and more. With 6 classes and their distinct playstyles to level up, the amount of content included in the base game is insane, every post-match customization had me building different Space Marines of all aesthetics, colors, chapters and combinations imaginable.
Since I started playing, I went to my family’s house to retrieve my old 40k minis (Black Templars and Tyranids, very appropriate), read +5 novels (The End and the Death and the Ravenor trilogy), visited my local Games Workshop retail store (first time since I was 16), and purchased and started painting some new Black Templar units (the whole Primaris upgrade is new to me, the minis are quite bigger).

Pros:
Fluid and satisfying gameplay: fighting the hordes is satisfactory, with a mixed mix between body brutality and adrenaline shootings.The use of weapons and skills is very intuitive and does not require demanding mechanics.

Cooperative mode: playing with friends adds a note of greater fun and more strategy, perfect for dealing with the most demanding missions.

Promising post-launch support: with a community already passionate about the universe of Warhammer and/or newbies players who want to know this world, the improvement potential can be very high for future updates, DLC and additional content.
AGAINST:
Limited exploration and a few really immersive maps: personally, I think the game is often linear and you do not have the opportunity to freely explore the surrounding environment to discover secrets, additional details on the Lore or, more simply, unique objects to collect.As for the scenarios, however, I expected that some maps were more Creepy and treated to a Grimdark context.",2024/11/29,it

Titus is alive!
From the release of the first part, long thirteen years passed, but the developers did not spit on the story of Titus and returned it to the universe again.After the accusation of the Inquisition, the captain is lowered with the rank of lieutenant and sent to lure sins before the Imperium of mankind in the guard of death.The successful completion of the next mission, almost at the cost of his own life, opens the hero back back to ultramarins.After returning to the landing detachment, the body is pumped to Titus - now it becomes primaaris.
The developers worked well on the plot and provided a full -fledged, coherent and understandable story about the once beloved character.It corresponds to the Laura of the Universe and may interest a third -party player.But not in everything - fans know the features of the origin of the Ultramarins detachment and will definitely pay attention to one detail in the Titus team.But watching the events is quite exciting, especially with love for the universe.Throughout the campaign, players will have to participate in several dangerous missions and fight with numerous forces of hostile fractions.
Unfortunately, gamers unfamiliar with the original do not feel the connection of the protagonist with the original story and may be lost in some conventions of the world.Despite such a feature, Space Marine 2 will definitely please lovers of dynamic shootings and cooperative battles.It is in the gameplay that the main power of the project is.

""Waha"" - how it is
Earlier, I already mentioned the direct continuation of the events of the original, but it is worth noting the exact hit by the atmosphere of the entire universe.Brutal brutal battles, rivers of blood, hard hierarchy and following Laura - each fragment of the game in detail conveys the world beloved by many fans.Following the primary source is noticeable even in models of characters and a huge set of options for performing armor of heroes.
Space Marine 2 will definitely enjoy detailed effects, background images and environment.The design of the locations came out corridor and understandable for study-it will not work somewhere to get lost, a marker or a crowd of enemies running out of Titus, will tell the right direction.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is filled with an epic, colorful and endless shootings, brutal action, blood rivers and a campaign filled with events.This turns out to be quite enough to immerse the player in the setting and allow him to enjoy the atmosphere of cruelty and injustice in the world.

Pros:

-Dalized world with a realistic atmosphere;
-Dynamic shootings with crowds of opponents;
-coloring effects and animations;
-Brutal and bloody action in the spirit of Warhammer 40,000.

Cons:

-the lobe amount of the ""endheim"" of the content;
-At the basic skills.

I strongly recommend both the fans of the WH40K and beginners who want to meet this beautiful franchise!",2024/11/28,ru

Plot:

Simple, but generally pleasant and does not cause rejection.

Gameplay:

In general, it is very pleasant to play.Gameplay my respect, took the formula of the first part and brought to mind.I noticed that many call bolt weapons the same type, in a sense it is, but still the difference between them is quite large.Shoot and cut enemies for a continuous pleasure, which are worth the executions.

PVP:

As a player in the PVP, it became boring quite quickly because of monotonous and mirror cards, although the game does not position itself as a competitive one.I would like to add some events or destruction, since the conditions during the game do not change in any way, Mesilovo 6 to 6 quickly bothers.

In addition, it is very sad that they did not add the customization of xcm.Dark angels will come out in December, I will assume that they still brought a chaos with a chaos)
