The game itself is also super fun. The PvP and the campaign are a joy to play. Your actions feel deliberate, almost as if you're controlling an Angel in a 1 Ton metal suit. I love it.

-------------------------------

It's sad that I have to say this, but it's wonderfully refreshing to be able to boot up a game, play for an hour or two, and close it again. Rather than boot it up, do my dailies, check my weeklies, check my season pass etc.


While this should be something to be praised in the year 2024, it is refreshing to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hani derler ya, ""ilk oyunun devamÄ±"" diye, iÅŸte bu tam olarak Ã¶yle bir ÅŸey.

Oyun, Ultramarines'in kahramanÄ± Titus'la devam ediyor. Titus, geÃ§miÅŸte yaÅŸadÄ±ÄŸÄ± olaylardan sonra bir nevi kefaret Ã¶demek iÃ§in Deathwatch'a katÄ±lmÄ±ÅŸ ve ÅŸimdi tekrar Ultramarines'in arasÄ±nda. Hikaye, Tyranid istilasÄ±yla baÅŸlÄ±yor ve bu noktada, ""savaÅŸtan baÅŸka bir ÅŸey bilmeyen bir Space Marine"" olgusunu tam anlamÄ±yla yaÅŸÄ±yorsunuz. Titus'un Ã¶ykÃ¼sÃ¼, savaÅŸÄ±n ve kahramanlÄ±ÄŸÄ±n neredeyse mitolojik bir anlatÄ±mÄ± gibi, ama aÃ§Ä±kÃ§asÄ± ""kahramanlÄ±k"" dediÄŸimiz ÅŸey burada biraz farklÄ± iÅŸliyor. KahramanlÄ±k, daha Ã§ok Imperium'u savunma ve dÃ¼ÅŸmanÄ± yok etme Ã¼zerine kurulu.

Titus'Ä± kontrol etmek inanÄ±lmaz tatmin edici. Her adÄ±mÄ±nÄ±z dÃ¼ÅŸmanlarÄ± titretiyor, her vuruÅŸunuz onlarÄ± yok ediyor. Oyun, sizi dÃ¼ÅŸmanlarÄ±nÄ±za karÅŸÄ± uyanÄ±k kalmanÄ±z konusunda zorluyor. Ã‡Ã¼nkÃ¼ sadece gÃ¼Ã§lÃ¼ olmak yetmiyor, zamanlamanÄ±z ve kaÃ§manÄ±z Ã¶nemli. Ã–zellikle Tyranid'lerin hamlelerine karÅŸÄ± savunma yapmak, sizi oyunda sÃ¼rekli uyanÄ±k tutuyor.

Warhammer evrenine sadÄ±k kalarak, oyun grafikleri ve ses tasarÄ±mÄ± gerÃ§ekten etkileyici. Games Workshop'un minyatÃ¼rlerini hayata geÃ§irmiÅŸler adeta. Her dÃ¼ÅŸman, her ortam, sanki masaÃ¼stÃ¼ oyununuzdan fÄ±rlamÄ±ÅŸ gibi. SavaÅŸÄ±n ortasÄ±nda, gotik yapÄ±lar arasÄ±nda dolaÅŸÄ±rken, atmosfer gerÃ§ekten sizi iÃ§ine Ã§ekiyor.




ÃœÃ§ oyunculu co-op modu kesinlikle baÅŸarÄ±lÄ± ve oyunu eÄŸer moda girerek oynayan arkadaÅŸlarÄ±nÄ±z varsa daha zevki kÄ±lÄ±yor.Pvp modu ise her ne kadar Space Marinleri kaÄŸÄ±t askerlere Ã§evirse de iyi dengelenmiÅŸ ve gears oyunu oynuyormuÅŸ hissiyatÄ±nÄ± veriyor.



Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, gÃ¼zel bir deneyim. Hem Warhammer evrenine yeni olanlar iÃ§in, hem de eski fanlar iÃ§in mÃ¼kemmel bir tazeleme. OynanÄ±ÅŸÄ±n derinliÄŸi, hikayenin atmosferi ve multiplayer modunun kalitesi, bu oyunu 2024'Ã¼n akÄ±lda kalÄ±cÄ± oyunlarÄ±ndan biri yapÄ±yor. EÄŸer aksiyon, strateji ve biraz da karanlÄ±k bilim-kurgu seviyorsanÄ±z, bu oyunu kesinlikle denemelisiniz. Tatmin edici, heyecan verici ve Warhammer evrenine dÃ¶nÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼nÃ¼zde size eÅŸlik edecek gÃ¼zel bir yapÄ±t.

+Saber Interactive, Warhammer evrenini beklenmedik ÅŸekilde iyi iÅŸlemiÅŸ
+VuruÅŸ hissiyatÄ± ve yÃ¼rÃ¼rken hissedilen aÄŸÄ±rlÄ±k mÃ¼kemmel
+KalabalÄ±k sahneler ve geniÅŸ Ã¶lÃ§ekli Kadaku manzaralarÄ± Ã§ok baÅŸarÄ±lÄ±
+Parry ve takla sistemi oyuna iyi yedirilmiÅŸ
+Karakterlerin boyutlarÄ±,davranÄ±ÅŸlarÄ± araÅŸtÄ±rÄ±larak Ã¶zenlice ve doÄŸru yapÄ±lmÄ±ÅŸ

-Ne yazÄ±k ki zayÄ±f diyaloglar
-Potansiyeli kullanÄ±lmamÄ±ÅŸ yan karakterler,sonlara kadar tekrar eden yan karakter geliÅŸimi
-DÃ¼ÅŸman Ã§eÅŸitliliÄŸi yok denecek kadar az ve herhangi bir taktik kullanmanÄ±zÄ± gerektiren bir bÃ¶lÃ¼m bulunmuyor

This feels like playing one of those games that came out during the years 2005-2010 where each game had to have a campaign, co-op and pvp. It is almost unbelievable that we can still experience a good game in this day and age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Listen brothers! I have waited more than 10 years for this game.
And by the emperor it delivered...with some minor flaws.

When the first trailer came out it hit most Space Marine fans as a huge surprise since nobody
ever expected a sequel to finally arrive myself included, but oh boy we can be all thankful that it did because it's a blast!

I will create a mini section for the 3 main parts of the game, which are the following: The story mode, the co-op operations and PvP.

Let's start with the campaign:
What is your craft? Death.

It's a little bit on the shorter side but it's quite a ride. I try to remain spoiler free , so you can experience it for yourselves.
The gameplay is a mix of the original space marine paired with the horde system with tyranids and it works wonder for this game.
In the early game, depending on the difficulty you picked might feel slightly weak, but:
1) It's required for a healthy gameplay progression (By the middle, you'll feel a lot more potent with the gear you have, and at the end you'll be straight overpowered with a certain weapon combo), and don't forget that tyranids can rip through Astartes especially Warriors.

There is also a surprise enemy later on, which most of you'll probably expect, but it managed to be something new, a faction we never seen in a 40K game before. A breath of fresh air, a welcome change, you'll see.

I'd recommend taking it slow on the ship and taking in the ambience and mini events that happen between missions, they are 40K perfected. The devs clearly had passion and care about the source material.

And the final level: You are going to love it if you like Warhammer. It starts on a high momentum and keeps going and going until the very end. The boardroom meeting about it must have been like: ""How much hype do you want during the last 2 hours?"" ""Yes.""

So yeah, the story mode is roughly 7-8 hours long depending on the difficulty you pick, but it's a ride you'll remember.



The bread and butter of the game for the devs, the mode they clearly have priority on and want to expand further during the first 4 seasons of the game.
It's a mix of Darktide (With the fixed missions that can randomise) , WWZ with it's progression system and horde mechanics, and Space Marine with it's gameplay loop.

Overally it's really solid and has longevity if you like that kind of stuff, you can upgrade your characters and wargear with branching paths, and it's really really fun especially with friends.

There are only a few downsides as of writing this:

1) Class locks. Understandable but you can matchmake with a certain class selected and get dropped into a match in progress where you are forced to switch or quit.
2) No option to host a public lobby on your own. That's allegedly getting changed ""soon"". We'll see.
3) Balance. The balance is fine for the most part, there is only one black sheep , the assault class. It's rather weak, or simply doesn't have it's proper plance among the 6 mainline classes. It needs some slight love.



Not much to say, it gives you vibes of a game that's from 2012...but that's a good thing. You have 3 modes, the classic domination mode, team deathmatch and king of the hill. The TTK (Time to kill) is fast as it should be, and the matches are really fast and fun.

Balance seems fine for the most part, i'v played a lot of matches, unlocked some relic armors and never felt like anything needs a nerf. Of course it's early to tell, we have to wait until the community unlocks everything and some time passes, but so far it's solid.

There is only one big negativity when it comes to pvp: The maps. Don't get me wrong, they are good but there are only 3 maps currently in the game. They are adding more later on, but you can't help but feel like there should have been at least a few more on release.

A short summary for the end:
ğŸŸ© Pros ğŸŸ¥ Cons

-An amazing campaign mode, which makes 40k come alive -That is slightly on the shorter side
-A really fun, classic vibe PVP mode -That has little map variety
-The graphics are really nice and works well with the art design -Technical issues on some systems, i had no problems
-The coop mode is a blast especially with friends.
-It's a long awaited sequel to Space Marine 1 and it delivers

If you read through all that, i would like to thank you for taking your time to do so and have a nice day dear reader!
Also thank you for Saber interactive for making such a banger of a sequel!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Never cared much about Warhammer until this game showed me the error of my ways and made me cast away the heresy and fully embrace the Emperor's glorious light. No longer do I wander in the shadow of ignorance, for Space Marine 2 has torn asunder the veil that clouded my mortal sight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With each righteous strike of the chainsword, I felt the will of the Emperor coursing through my veins. The xenos or the hereticâ€”none can stand before the might of the Adeptus Astartes, and now I, too, feel the weight of that sacred duty upon my shoulders. Every battle is a prayer to His undying majesty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In this game, I learned what it truly means to be a warrior of the Imperium: to purge the unclean without hesitation, to stand unwavering in the face of annihilation, and to know that failure is not an option, for failure would mean the death of mankind itself. This is no mere entertainmentâ€”this is an initiation into the sacred brotherhood of those who fight for the survival of the Imperium.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Space Marine 2 is not just a gameâ€”it is a revelation, a holy writ in digital form, and a reminder that we must be ever vigilant, ever faithful, and ever ready to cleanse the galaxy of those who would defy the Emperor's will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A salute to all the fallen battle brothers who couldn't be here with us after those 12 years of waiting.

This game is everything we were waiting for. A satisfying continuation of Titus's story.

A PvE mode that lets you play with 2 other battle brothers against the infinite hordes of Xenos filth and chaos scum.

A 6v6 PvP mode with three maps. Good balance between classes and weapons.

Pros:
- Phenomenal voice acting (Rollo ftw!)
- Breathtaking visuals
- Satisfying campaign
- Online modes are fun
- NO micro transactions
- NO daily missions, just get in and play
- Extensive customization options
- Good optimization

Cons:
YOU DARE QUESTION THE PURITY OF THIS FINE AND WORTHY SEQUEL? To even think of it is heresy. You have been marked for careful observation.

Summary
Campaign: <15 hours of loreful hack n slash fun.
PvE: Fun with friends, but undercooked, linear and clunky
PvP: Fun with friends, but bare bones and unbalanced

I recently replayed Space Marine 1, and the sequel is a much better game. The visuals, sound and feel are all spot on for a Space Marine fantasy. However, it doesn't quite achieve everything it sets out to, and its secondary modes fall short of other similar games.

Campaign
This is very much a 40k story, with writing reminiscent of a black library novel. That is both good and bad, with the over the top sclock, bravado, action and machismo you'd expect. The grim reality of the Imperium is acknowledged, but on the whole it leans closer to glorification than critique.

The gameplay is a continuation of the first game's mechanics and feel, with chainswords and plasma guns feeling suitably impactful. It is highly linear, without meaningful choice and very little exploration. Being combat oriented and straight to the point is very Astartes, but would have grown wearisome if the campaign were any longer. The scripted executions are similarly timed to stay interesting right up to the end of the campaign, but perhaps not much longer.

There are obvious missed opportunities here. Like the vehicle levels which have placeholder cutscenes but don't let you control them, or terrain destruction which happens all around you, but you can't actually change. its also quite short, at under ten hours if you race through, or perhaps 15 if you take your time and play the optional missions as they unlock.

Still, overall it is an enjoyable romp over a couple of days

This is the bulk of the end game replayability, and the customisation will please many tabletop fans. However it has some key limitations. It doesn't have the visual depth or gunplay of Darktide, nor the endless variety and replayability of Vermintide or Left for Dead. This is a much more linear experience where you replay the same maps over and over. You do get variety from the different classes and upgrades, but progression is largely cosmetic or minor stat buffs.

Beyond the limited number of maps, skills and enemies, there are also pretty limited number of weapons, with quite a few slots having only a single option. You're likely to get dozens of hours of fun here, but maybe not hundreds. The repetition of things like execution animations which started to show in the campaign will become very clear over repeated play throughs of these levels. There is a roadmap with more content, lets hope there is enough in the pipeline to keep the juices flowing.

This is a throwback to a different kind of multiplayer, back to the days of unreal tournament or halo at a LAN party. There is a very low time to kill, and strong reliance on team coordination. There are only three maps with three game modes, so the replayability here is again limited by content availability.

PvP will be fun to play at launch, and if you have a crew together, but may struggle to drag people away from the hero shooters and mobas of the world long term.


This is a fun and brutal distraction for a few dozen hours. For some it will be a realisation of their childhood fantasy, for others it will be a gateway into an addiction they didn't know they wanted. It is a great entry into the set of warhammer games, and a worthy sequel to a fun game. It won't revolutionise the industry, but it does show that going back to basics and delivering what the fans want is a sound strategy for a good time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Blessed is the mind too small for doubt.â€?
Warhammer 40.000: Space Marine 2 (2024) represents a third-person hack-n-slash shooter game, developed by the company Saber Interactive and published by the company Focus Entertainment. The first instalment (2011) was developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ.



++ The campaign features the beginning of a Tyranid invasion, with all its horrors and endless tides of claws and teeth. Perfect setting for the grim dark future in which every melee execution results in a fountain of blood and guts. In the middle is our protagonist Demetrian Titus, who lets us see and experience the new story around him. That, dear reader, I consider the short-term motivation.

++ Now comes the long-term one, for the excellent integration of the cooperative modes allows us to play the campaign and secondary missions, called Operations, with up to two friends. Four difficulty levels in combination with six classes provide a broad spectrum of replayability. And for the brave, there is Eternal War mode, essentially a 6v6 PVP match that culminates in a battle between Space Marines and the Archenemy.

o What happened to the weight of the power armour? Each step of several hundred kilos of high-quality ceramite should leave an impact, yet the game does not convey the sounds or weight of it in a credible way. Just look at WH40K Boltgun for reference. What about the precision of ranged weaponry? Every time I fire several bolter shots the spread leaves me in disbelief. Any guardsman would severely doubt the marksmanship of that drunken angel of death standing next to him. What about crippling a Tyranid warrior? Unfortunately, not possible. A more detailed hit box with additional dismembering options would have been a great addition.

- Upon first launch of the game, an automatic installation of the Epic Online Services started. This constitues heresy of the highest order! The developers stated: â€We can assure you that this was only implemented to support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores.â€?Whatever the case, I immediately deinstalled it and the game runs just fine. And so should you, brother.

- A couple of bugs corrupted the holy binary code, e.g. floating items, delayed rendering of textures, clipping and collision issues. Saber Interactiveâ€™s tech priests have initiated counter protocols. The Omnissiah knows all, comprehends all.

-- I am shocked to witness the atrocities committed in front of my sacred codex. A simple Tyranid hormagaunt survives a bolter shot, and it takes a magazine to fell a warrior type. A fundamental misunderstanding of the technical background of the weapon. And I will not even start complaining about what they did to my dear melta and plasma weapons. Furthermore, there is a crippling imbalance between ranged and melee attacks, with the emphasis clearly on the latter. Just try to execute a warrior from 10 meters away, let me know how it went. The Inquisition has been informed of the devsâ€?transgressions; their punishment will be servitude in a penal legion against the greenskins on Armageddon.



The game nails the atmosphere of a Tyranid invasion, and the superb co-op gameplay allows for countless hours of playing the campaign with your battle brothers or prove your teamâ€™s tactical prowess in PVE and PVP sessions.

On the other hand, it displays some blatant lore inaccuracies and focuses more on close combat than on firearms, which completely undermines my attempts to crowd control the waves of biomass with ranged weapons. The Codex Astartes does not support this action!

Recommended for determined initiates and seasoned veterans, loyal to Roboute Guilliman, standing firm against the xenos filth in the darkest hours of the Imperium of Man.

â€œIn the grim darkness of the far future, there is only warâ€? A historical quote that single-handedly resumes the bleak, brutal universe of 40K; humanity spans the stars, its society on the verge of collapse and only carried by a fanatically-rooted war economy. SM1â€™s protagonist, Titus, insect-like Tyranids and the Ruinous Powers of Chaos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tale of Titus and his two Ultramarine companions is lore-accurate and engaging â€?40K fans will catch many references and bits a newcomer wouldnâ€™t, but that doesnâ€™t make it unenjoyable if youâ€™re new to the franchise. Characters arenâ€™t one-sided and have solid narrative depth; the feeling of being an important cog of the Imperial war machine â€?but a cog nonetheless â€?is conveyed perfectly, as it should be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Visually and artistically, few games can equal the desolate beauty of SM2. From the enormous Tyranid swarms laying waste to all, to the iridescent distortions of Warp powers and the blasts of Cadian artillery, everything looks and sounds amazingly crisp. Settings are varied and rich in detail, with more than a few impressive landscapes. Weapon sounds, different based on the enemy faced and weapon used, add great emphasis to the destruction of tougher foes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maps are linear, with one path to follow once either all foes are slain, or certain objectives are completed. Still, exploring the few side-areas, nothing more than crevices or branching dead-ended paths, youâ€™ll find precious supplies and uncommon weapons that will improve your survival chances: medkits, Relics allowing you to revive once, heavy weapons and ammunition caches. Lore-related Dataslates also can be listened to in order to better understand the events that transpired. There are no collectibles or proper secrets to mention, nor a map, which you wonâ€™t need given the fairly-simple layouts and on-demand objective markers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The superb combat system of SM2 is articulate and skill-based, fully conveying the brutality of conflicts of such a scale and, on the higher difficulties, the lethality of Mankindâ€™s enemies. With one melee and two ranged weapons, youâ€™ll lay waste to all Xenos, as a few hits are all thatâ€™s needed (on the higher difficulties) to be slain. A responsive system of dodge, parry and riposte rewards timing and reflexes, restoring your armor so that your health isnâ€™t affected â€?the latter only restored by special abilities or rare consumable Stimms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each enemy is dangerous and behaves coherently to their role, even the lesser ones pose a threat, given their sheer numbers â€?heavier ones, especially mini-bosses, might even one-shot you given the chance, from the Bolter in its variants to the mighty Thunder Hammer, Plasma Guns and the devastating Krak Grenades will all become available to you as the story progresses â€?theyâ€™re not infinite however, so use your ammunition wisely. SM2 encourages aggressive playstyles with its armor regen mechanics, as slaying enemies in melee with perfect parries not only will bolster your defenses and allow devastating counters, but also allow the use of your Ultimate ability, making you unstoppable and regenerate health for a short time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fights are high-stakes, packed with gore and exciting, with a system that is nearly-perfectly designed for this genre. Unfortunately, your companions, mighty as they may be, and canâ€™t be equipped with custom loadouts, unlike yourself. Bosses are all unique, barring a few repeating ones, and extremely difficult to overcome on the harder settings. Their tactics change as they lose health, and usually only a few hits from them spell your doom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the Campaign, youâ€™ll have several Operations: PvE missions parallel to the main story that depict critical events and feature another Ultramarine team that helped Titus in the main story. Contrary to the campaign, here you'll have access to six customizable classes, each with unique loadout capabilities and Ultimate skills, other than different passive perks and weapons to unlock as you gain XP after an Operation is cleared. Experimenting with different playstyles and combinations, adds solid replay value and good progression feeling. These Operations also have progressively increasing difficulty, with better rewards, such as cosmetics, XP bonuses and so forth, proportional to the difficulty youâ€™ll engage into â€?however, you won't go far in the harder difficulties without better gear and advanced perks, despite all of the settings being available from the start regardless of level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The PvP mode, Endless War, has Chaos forces face the Space Marines in a variety of objective-based modes, ranging from the classic Deathmatch to more nuanced ones. It allows full loadout customizations just as in the PvE mode," and is a nice addition for those interested in competing against other players to test their skills.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know absolutely nothing about Warhammer, and never played the games before, but when I saw a big beefy boi ripping aliens into shreds, I was intrigued.

Anyway, this game was great. Played the campaign partially solo and partially coop. Melee is very satisfying and fun. The shooting is also nice but usually feels pretty ineffective given the lower ammo capacity of most guns. The first moment of the game where you see a huge swarm running at you is terrifying but also exhilarating.

I will say the first half of the game was my favorite, as the other enemies later on don't seem quite as fun to fight, but it was still enjoyable. I never skipped a cutscene, as they were really drawing me in even with no knowledge of the universe. The world building, overall art direction and scenery is just impeccable, and I probably spent upwards of 30+ minutes just staring at the vistas.

Haven't even tried the coop missions or MP yet, but I can say this game was super well done and really fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game is great but why do we need to kill so much?

Why can we not reason with these creatures or heretics?

If you found yourself agreeing with these questions, there is a taint in your heart and you have been seen by his glorious gaze and marked a traitor to mankind.
The goal for any true servents of the Emperor who dream of joining the ranks of his angels is simple.

Kill until Killed.

And to the traitors i spoke to before. Report to the lower decks and become Bio Paste.

Nach Ã¼ber einem Jahrzehnt der Vorfreude, zahllosen Gebeten und gelegentlichem Fluchen, hat Titus endlich wieder seine ikonische RÃ¼stung angelegt â€?bereit, Alien-Horden den Garaus zu machen. Aber die Frage bleibt: Ist es der lang ersehnte Triumph, auf den wir gewartet haben? Oder nur ein weiteres digitalisiertes Blutbad ohne Hirn und Herz? Wir haben uns die heilige Bolter geschnappt und uns in die Schlacht gestÃ¼rzt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kaum hat man das Spiel gestartet, gibt es keine Zeit fÃ¼r sanfte EinfÃ¼hrung oder tiefgrÃ¼ndige philosophische GesprÃ¤che. Stattdessen bekommst Du eine dicke Bolter in die Hand gedrÃ¼ckt und wirst in eine Armee von Tyraniden geworfen. Der Held unserer Geschichte, Captain Titus, ist der Inbegriff des Space Marine-Klischees: unzerstÃ¶rbar, zynisch und mit der moralischen Empathie eines Kettenschwerts. Hier wird nicht lange gefackelt â€?als ob ein Bulldozer gegen eine Horde Wutkranke fÃ¤hrt â€?rÃ¼cksichtslos, wenn Dein Kettenschwert in eine Gruppe Aliens fÃ¤hrt, ist purer Balsam, fÃ¼r die vom Alltag strapazierte, Seele. Strategischer Tiefgang? Vergiss es! Du bist kein Schachmeister, Du bist ein Kriegsinstrument, und Deine einzige Taktik lautet: alles in Sichtweite vernichten. Die kleine subtile EinfÃ¼hrung ist dabei keineswegs zu kurz oder lang geraten.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Die Geschichte von Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 ist so episch und tiefgrÃ¼ndig wie ein Motivationsposter in einem BÃ¼ro: Sie ist da, aber eigentlich interessiert sie keinen. Captain Titus kehrt zurÃ¼ck, und mit Ihm die alte Weisheit, dass Worte zwar mÃ¤chtig sein mÃ¶gen, aber nichts gegen eine gut platzierte Bolter-Salve ausrichten kÃ¶nnen. Die Tyraniden fressen ganze Welten, und Titus tut das, was er am besten kann: alles zerschlagen, was nicht imperial oder nach Xenos aussieht. Tiefgehende Charakterentwicklung? Fehlanzeige. DafÃ¼r gibtâ€™s aber ordentlich was auf die ZwÃ¶lf â€?und ehrlich gesagt, ist das genau die Art von Storytelling, die wir verdient haben. FÃ¼r alles andere, gibt es die BÃ¼cher.

Was gibt es SchÃ¶neres, als eine Horde Xenos in StÃ¼cke zu schieÃŸen? Genau â€?das Ganze mit Freunden zu tun. Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 liefert uns einen Coop-Modus, der keine groÃŸen Reden schwingt, sondern Dich und Deine Kumpels direkt in die Schlacht schmeiÃŸt. Hier geht es nicht um ausgeklÃ¼gelte Taktiken oder kluges Zusammenspiel â€?es geht darum," wer als Erster """"FÃ¼r den Imperator!"""" schreit", stÃ¼rzt Ihr Euch in Missionen die darauf ausgelegt sind, Teamwork zu fÃ¶rdern â€?zumindest insofern, dass Ihr euch gegenseitig wiederbelebt, wenn einer der Kameraden im Eifer des Gefechts mal das zeitliche segnet. Meine persÃ¶nliche Empfehlung: Spielt den Coop unbedingt auf dem Schwierigkeitsgrad â€Engel des Todesâ€?(Kampagne) oder â€Gnadenlosâ€?(PvE), denn nur dort kommt der wahre SpaÃŸ und die brutale AuthentizitÃ¤t des gemeinsamen Schlachtens richtig zur Geltung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kein schamloser Cash-Shop, der Dir das Geld aus der Tasche ziehen will, wÃ¤hrend Du gerade Aliens zerlegst.

Hier gibt es nur eines zu tun: TÃ¶ten und Siege feiern.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 ist nichts fÃ¼r zartbesaitete GemÃ¼ter.

After 54 hours of playing since the 4-day Early Access, Warhammer Space Marine 2 has left me speechless...

I'm new to the Warhammer 40,000 games and I want to say that I'm totally going to get into this amazing saga

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 
A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
By: â™?Helena Meow â™?

The best part of the game:

- Performance 10/10
- Graphics
- Gameplay and all types of finishers (50 in total)
- Variety of Bosses and Enemies
- Very complete customization (Skins, colors, weapons, perks...)
- Co-op / Multiplayer and Story Mode
- Variety of Weapons & Grenades
- Soundtrack
- Cinematics (It feels like you're in a Warhammer movie)

ğŸ’™

Story Mode:

During the first mission Captain Titus is ordered to carry a bomb to be launched into the atmosphere to kill all the Tyranids on the planet, but when he fails and is about to die he is demoted to Lieutenant for alleged corruption.
After being operated on he is reassigned back to the battalion, but as a Lieutenant and during this adventure he will be with his new companions Chairon and Gadriel who will accompany him on all the missions.
At the end of the campaign there is an open ending in which Titus is sent to another place temporarily which we can see in a future sequel of the game or a future DLC.

ğŸ’™

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 other game modes:

- Eternal War Mode: 6 vs 6 PVP matches in 3 different game modes (Conquest, Capture and Control and Annihilation)

- Operations Mode: Co-operative Story Mode for up to 3 players that has a total of 6 missions (Recommended to play after completing the campaign)

ğŸ’™

Totally recommended game without a doubt.
One of the best games I've played this year and I'm very happy with this purchase, which hasn't had any launch errors.
The 2-year wait has been worth it because they've released a game that's worth it.

One of the best Warhammer 40000 game i have ever played! Juicy finisher animation, good melee and range combat system, good campaign, amazing PVE mode, deep character customization system.

I am leaving the game since there is not much content and there is nothing more to discover by that moment: 7 PVE missions, 3 PVP maps and less than 10 hours campaign. Plus add problems with disconections due to server issues. Thought this should be fixed by now but its been 2 months since the release and i still got disconected every 1-2 hour. It is very dissapointed to play a map for 30 mins and got disconnected from the server prior 5 min to the end.

Still i would reccomened this game for new players and Warhammer 40000 veterans!

an absolutely bombastic campaign with over the top crescendo of a finale guaranteed to summon an adamantium boner in every warhammer fan.

not without issues tho: servers can be iffy at times, applied cosmetics can reset if you're unlucky and post-story operations mode could definitely use more missions added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the scene with holding the banner, Iâ€™ve had an erection that has lasted more than 8 hours. Should I seek medical help immediately, or can I finish a few more missions first?

Iâ€™ve already tried reading the Codex, but it only makes things worse.

The Strongest 40K game for the Strongest Day
For anyone with even the slightest interest in Warhammer 40,000, this game's arguably the best Warhammer 40,000 title to release after the bankruptcy of THQ, after 13 years of getting a bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games that between 2018 and Boltgun's release, the best way to enjoy the Grim Darkness of the 41st Millennium in video games was honestly to create Space Marines in SoulCalibur VI. I'll admit i've only played the first missions of the main story and the co-op campaign respectively, though my first impressions of the game have me confident that I'm gonna get a lot of enjoyment from the rest of it.

Gameplay
Being a continuation of Relic Entertainment's Space Marine, combat is meant to have you split your attention between melee and ranged combat, and I feel like Saber Interactive did a much better job at making melee more viable compared to SM1, and I think the dodging and parrying mechanics were the main things that buffed the game's melee, cuz I remember that using your chainsword in the first game was a very fast way to get got by the Ork Boyz and Nobs, often really only being used in the campaign's jump pack sections.

One thing which I can already tell that people miss is SM1's health system. While I personally don't have issues with how health is handled in SM2, I feel like they could've introduced a temporary health mechanic similar to L4D's pain pills for the executions, cuz the armor blips tend to not last very long in the face of your ankles being bitten by multiple hormagaunts, and fodder enemies can be equated to death by a thousand paper cuts. This is a minor nitpick on my end, though one thing I've found from the first half of the second mission is a harsher criticism.

While other games might enjoy putting the player in a forced turret section, Space Marine 2 has forced flamethrower sections, where the game leaves a Pyreblaster near a door to inform the player that they will have to fight against Rippers, small legless creatures that are about the size of a house cat, but swarm you in the hundreds of thousands. It's annoying enough that firing the weapon slows your walking speed significantly, though the fact that they deal pathetically low damage is needless frustration, especiallly since the smaller mortal-sized flamers have been proven to be effective against Hormagaunt and (former) human alike in other forms of Warhammer 40,000 media.

Moving onto the co-op Operations mode, this to me feels like the co-op experience that fans have been craving since the days of the first Space Marine game. Though I've only really played the Vanguard, I found it to be a pretty solid experience, though I personally wish they added a Firstborn class in the game. To those unaware, Games Workshop has been trying to redesign the Space Marine identity from the ground up, though certain weapons from the earlier days of Warhammer 40,000 are unavailable to the modern depictions of the Adeptus Astartes.

With Warhammer 40K being full of intricate gothic architecture you'd expect to find in a fantasy setting with the first antagonist you fight being a swarm of buglike creatures that hope to overwhelm you with their numbers, I think it's fair to expect a hardware-intense game. With the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X targeting 1440p and 30FPS, it's fair to say that it's a pretty demanding game. I'm personally on a Ryzen 3800X and RTX 3070, and while i'm on 1080p myself, the game typically hovers around 50-81 FPS, though there are occasionally some dips down to 41 in moments of high activity. While demanding, I wouldn't call it unstable since in the 6 hours I've clocked in so far, I've actually only had one crash, which is a huge improvement from how frequently the leaked build would crash on the same machine. I don't think more modest machines can realistically target 60fps without utilizing the game's built-in upscaling options, though I think the Dynamic Resolution option isn't functional.

Those who have spent a lot of time personalizing their Space Marine in the first game are gonna be let down with the second one. With Games Workshop trying to push the Primaris Space Marines as the new face of Warhammer 40,000, the number of options available to customize your looks has been severely neutered, to such a degree they had to make colors and emblems unlockable. It's especially egregious in my personal opinion that the fully sealed Mk X Phobos helmet isn't in the game, since that at least is a callback to the old scowl helmets from the pre-9th Edition days of Warhammer 40K.

While we might never get a chance to beat up those holier-than-thou knife-ears that Guilliman seems so attracted to these days, Space Marine 2 is definitely one of those games where an admittedly painful wait turned out to actually be worth the delay it ate, which is a welcome surprise when you consider that game delays in current year are a sign of the dev team thinking that their game's an absolute dumpster fire, especially with 40K. Do i think that this game will be the standard that other devs will follow when handling the license? Unfortunately, no. With that said, I think the June 2024 leak has proven to be a blessing in disguise, and I hope that Saber would at least consider releasing the prologue and first mission for free as a post-release demo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rarely do I finish games in one sitting and Space Marine 2 is an absolute blast from start to finish. So it's a rare game from that list.

I do understand that people are struggling with some issues here, but for me it was a smooth 9 hours sailing from the main menu to the end titles bar a few toilet breaks.

Space Marine 2 is a perfect sequel like Uncharted 2 was to Uncharted 1. It is a living, breathing and brilliatntly realized vision of 40k universe in all it's gory glory and spectacular epicness. I can't find porper words to describe how perfect and true to the setting almost every detail and element is.

We've never seen WH40k universe realized with such care, fidelity and production quality. Never. This is the best WH40k media to date and the closest to the huge Warhammer 40k movie we're all dreaming about.

For non-WH fan it's still a bombastic no-BS-TPS with tremendous production values and surprising amount of polishing and variety. Just ignore the lore altogether and watch in awe at the sights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Honestly, related to games, Space Marine 2 and Black Myth Wukong made this summer legendary!

- The story mod is awesome but short, around 6 missions with really cool cinematics.

- The online coop is 10/10, this part is where you should enjoy more in this game, is just perfect! and is where you get most of the game time.

- The multiplayer is ""meh"", you have it there, it's an option, you could play some matches but is the weakest point in the game. it feels slow with a lot of awkward situations and gimmicks.

Took me 119hrs to unlock all the steam achievements.

BTW, game run excellent, since I bought it I only had 1 crash. let me tell you with the today's standards, that's a good record.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Victory or Death
We fight to the end. We shall hold the line in every sector; we shall purge the Xenos filth and traitorous scum from the galaxy; we shall cleanse every world of their heresy; we shall smite them in the darkest reaches of the void; we shall crush them in His name, and we shall never relent.

We shall defend the Imperium, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight in the hive cities, we shall fight in the wastelands, we shall fight upon the moons and in the depths of the warp; we shall fight with bolter, blade, and honor; we shall never surrender.

And even if, for a moment, we are scattered or overrun, we shall never falter, for we know no fear. Until there is no corner left where our enemies may cower, we shall remain unwavering in His holy name. By our duty, by our faith, we shall stand eternal.

For the Emperor, for the Imperium, for humanity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By the Emperor and Holy Terra, this is a very good game. 10/10

What can I say... (Edit: A lot apparently)

From the campaign alone I think it was a solid buy.

The combat isn't mind-blowing DMC5/MGSR melee combat action awesomeness, and the shooting isn't quite as tight as more focused cover style shooters, but - and this is a big BUT - you feel like a space marine. How is that not cool?! You're a little slow, a little heavy, but you feel like a 10 foot tall dump truck ready to steamroll anything that isn't painted blue. The weapons don't have a massive amount of variety, but on some reflection, I think its acceptable. Would I have liked to see some of the more insane bits of kit for use? Sure, but that isn't really the ""I am a tactical marine that branches out a bit sometimes"" vibe that Titus gives off. (I would still kill for a terminator armor mission, to be clear.)

As far as the breadth of content goes, it took me just over 9 hours to beat the campaign on veteran, and I plan on going for max difficulty here in the near future. Was it a riveting story? No, not really. But it was good. It feels *authentic* in a way that was refreshing, like I could open just about any 40k book and find something like this in its pages. The story I think actually does itself a disservice in some ways where certain elements are underplayed or resolved a bit too quickly, but still, it had all of the beats it needed to, and a more than appropriate amount of justice to the setting to sell me on this being the actual 40k universe.

Some will see the 9 hour campaign and see that as a deal breaker. If you play on game-journalist difficulty and don't do anything but sprint from checkpoint to checkpoint, I wouldn't be surprised if you could get it as low as 7 hours. For some, 10 bucks an hour is a bad ROI, and if you don't have *any* interest in playing the PvE or PvP, then maybe that's all you'll get out of the game. But hear me out. We are often spoiled with sprawling massive games that suck you in for 100+ hours, and this isn't that. Instead, you get a meticulously, fairly challenging, hand crafted experience with what is perhaps one of the greatest fictional universes ever. That has to be worth *something* even if it means ""I'll definitely get it on sale""

To sum up:

If you are a fan of 40k or just like 3rd person action games, its an easy buy.

The only reason I would say to steer clear for now is if you expect nothing less than Elden Ring: Space Marine edition in the content department for your hard earned bucks (which, fair enough if that's you).

I look forward to grinding through the PvE content over the next week or so, and will probably even dabble in the PvP to check it out as the game gets updated over the next year, and perhaps even beyond!

(Thank you for coming to my TED talk.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You are essentially a walking tank, but you fight with the grace of a ballerina. This game renders many hundreds of enemies on screen but still manages to run well. Gameplay is fun and addicting. This is everything I want from a game in 2024: to feel like it released back in 2006, while looking even better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the best games I've played this year! Space Marines 2 reminds me a lot of the way I felt the first time I played Gears of Wars. Pure joy! This game is fun, gory, entertaining and beautiful. I am the target audience for this kind of game and I am here for all of it.

The game play is solid, the voice acting is top notch, and the graphics are stunning. This game has full PS5 DualSense support. Haptic feedback and haptic triggers makes an already great game 100 times even better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pues ya habiendo completado el modo historia, modo cooperativo y echado PvP puedo decir que el juego es crema, es la cima que tiene que alcanzar un juego de Warhammer 40k, sin despreciar a los demÃ¡s que hacen muy buen trabajo peor incluso estÃ¡ joya no estÃ¡ exenta de fallos. Empecemos:


Graficos y optimizaciÃ³n: 10/10
Si algo me gusta de Focus, es que los estudios que tiene trabajan muy bien en los juegos, es decir, Ã©ste juego con una 2080 la mueven en ultra y no baja en ningÃºn momento de 60 fps, todo lo que enseÃ±aron estÃ¡, nada de Downgrades.

Dificultad: 3/10
No sÃ© que le han hecho al juego en Ã©ste aspecto aparte de estar pensado para jugar con amigos, es que al jugar al modo coop e historia se les ha ido mucho la mano con enemigos que te pueden hacer instant kill, que vale que tenga que ser desafiante pero es un juego que estÃ¡s rodeado de enemigos, no hay forma de hacerlo de forma tÃ¡ctica, pero es que si lo juegas en modo normal, tambiÃ©n te dan tremenda ondanada de bofetones, en el coop no han llegado a matar en el nivel mÃ¡s bajo y eso que es el recomendado y no tiene nada que ver con el nivel de tÃº personaje.

Modo Historia: 7/10
Pues el modo Historia sin spoilers es un muy buen sucesor del uno dÃ¡ndole profundidad a los personajes y al propio mundo pero con unos quizÃ¡s errores de Lore que estÃ¡n muy cogidos con pinzas, pero dentro de lo que cabe, muy bueno

Modo Coop 8/10
Es la otra parte de campaÃ±a del modo historia y al igual que el modo Historia puedes jugarla solo o con amigos, no tiene nada mÃ¡s allÃ¡

PersonalizaciÃ³n: 9/10
AquÃ­ parece que han escuchado a la comunidad porque la mejorÃ­a es brutal, pudiendo personalidad independientemente cada parte del astartes, y con un detalle de que los colores son los colores de GW, por otro lado, lo malo, que todo estÃ¡ bloqueado todo y que parte son dlcs, ademÃ¡s de que lo peor es que a los Herejes no te dejan apenas personalizarlo, algo que me parece alucinante, espero que en el futuro lo cambien.

Modo Multi: 8/10

Esto no tiene nada mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de lo que hubo en el 1, mismos modos, en el futuro habrÃ¡ modo Supervivencia (Exterminatus) y no hay nada mÃ¡s destacable de que los niveles que subas aquÃ­ y lo que desbloquees no es conjunto con el modo coop, y es molesto porque hay mucho, demasiado que desbloquear y no da tanto de sÃ­ el juego

Nota Final 8/10
Un digno sucesor de Space Marine 1 con lo que uno espera de la secuela, mejoras, mÃ¡s sangra y muerte, y con momentazos brutales, muy bien conseguido",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think the game is great, but has a lot of design flaws that can definitely be fixed in a couple months if the devs are paying attention. I understand they had people to please by releasing it this early, but it could've used more time in the oven, as a bad launch can really sour a game's reputation (looking at you Darktide). I'd like to get my grievances out of the way before I name the positives.

Firstly, requiring internet and server connection for a game like this feels strange, and the enemies are definitely tied to the servers as they lag around if the connection is acting up. And not having some basic matchmaking functionality is very strange on release. You can't choose lobbies, you can't choose to host or join them, and you can't opt for a solo run; even worse, there is ZERO reconnecting to a match if you aren't playing w friends. If you get disconnected due to their server mishaps during a quick match, you lose your potential 30 minutes of progress. And on top of that, there is no kick prevention late into a match, so if you really wanted to kick at the very end, you could.

Second, it has terrible optimization all round; it loads horribly slow without an SSD, I have it on an NVME and it still loads slow sometimes. Performance feels really really low for a lot of systems that should run it at a steady 60 FPS no matter what. I have a 4060 ti and it definitely doesn't keep 60 FPS, it routinely drops to 40, not to mention any mid-range systems that can barely run the game in certain scenarios.

Third, is the combat system. It ALMOST feels good. Small enemies tear you up way more than they should ever, armor sustain feels weird in it's current implementation, and so does HP sustain. The whole bloodborne rally mechanic is fine, but there is almost no way to sustain HP outside of the overheal bug, and Apothecary/Bulwark's ultimate ability, 99% of the lobbies I queue on Ruthless difficulty do exactly that because of the current balance. You should get a 5% heal for majoris executions and 10% for extremis, and like 15-20% for terminus. That and the loadout drop pods should heal you to some degree. Armor should have to chipped away by small enemies, it should not be that tyranid warriors are less scary than a group of hormagaunts or shield tzaangors. And we should be able to animation cancel into a dodge roll from any animation, at reasonable frames, as well as cancel into a parry on certain animations. Parry into dodge roll should feel fluid too. being locked into things feels pretty awful sometimes.

The good stuff here has serious potential. The combat when it DOES work, feels awesome. There is a flow state you can find yourself in if the game is really working with you. The inspiration from other games really works with the way they constructed the game (save the dodge roll. Astartes would not GoW dodge roll, the Bulwark side step looks apt though), Between the Doom executions, the Gears of War combat style, and the spawn waves akin to the Tide games (elites, mini bosses, specials, chaff units. Which itself is inspired by the slightly more basic Left for Dead formula) they have something truly addicting with how it handles skill expression and SOMETIMES, difficulty. I like this game, but I would love it if they made some seemingly easy changes. They have the framework up already, so if they really care about their players, they'd make some number changes. Combat is a super easy fix. Matchmaking too. The optimization might take them longer.

Overall, get this game if you think it looks fun, but only if you have decent internet, and an mid to high end PC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""In their arrogant suspicion, the Inquisition failed to recognise the truth, that no evil will ever overcome a devotion such as yours.""

In around 9 hours of campaign the devs manage to pack so much story, so much lore, so much fun that it looks and feels like a XBOX 360 Game, by that i mean the best possible compliment i can think of, by that i mean that this game is simply tons of fun, the story is so simple yet so well done, its something in the likes of ""brothership, thrust, hardship, and overcoming the odds"", it doesn't need to be complex, it is a world of chaos, disgrace and corruption, and you, together with your brothers will punish the herectics responsible for this mess, easy and as i said, well done, this if by far one of the most fun and most enjoyable games i've played recently. I only wanted to say a few words but... Well, just go and play the damn game! And don't forget, GLORY TO ULTRAMAR!!

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nice campaign experience, but size of content doesn't match the price (~10h campaign + 6 PVE maps + PVP) .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Combat is not easy and requires practice to excel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's the monster rather than player that control the rhythm of fight, parry and counterattack is vital if you want to win the game smoothly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a 40k lover I'm more than satisfied with the campaign. But, if you're not a 40k fan, this game is not recommended at full price. (There would be more content in 2025," wait until then if you are interested)""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TL;DR? Yes, I recommend this game, it's simple old school fun, some caveats here and there, regarding multiplayer, some epic shenanigans and, maybe replayability.
But if you want to have fun, it delivers.

I played the first Space Marine years ago, not when it was relaced but a few years ago, and I had fun. This game feels like coming back to that Xbox 360 era, of ""simpler"" games, you just want to burn some time, doing some bombastic and silly violence, it's perfect doing that.
You got a decent and fun to play campaign that can be played on coop with friends, (I recommend because the bots kinda suck), operations that complement the campaign, they are coop missions where you unluck experience and cosmetics, and a PVP mode.


The biggest pro's of this game, in my opinion are the gameplay, just raw fun, it can feel repetitive but, it feels so good that honestly I don't care. It can be punishing in harder difficulties but if you master the dodge and parry system you become an unstoppable killing machine.
The visuals and presentation are spectacular, from the first to the last minutes, I stopped several times to admire the work of the devs bringing to life the 40K universe, and Kudos to Saber, they did a great job. Not just representing the dark and grim aesthetic, the technical spectacle of seeing thousand of enemies on screen, the colors, particles, explosions, textures, blood. Delightful, I can say the same about the sound design and music as well.
The story is there, it's not going to blow your mind but hey, it isn't bad at all. It's a good conduct to the slaughter gameplay.

The weak points of the package, imo of course, are... maybe some optimization, lack of graphic options (ahem, FOV slider), Epic anti cheat and online services, these are kinda silly though, you can uninstall the online services if you don't want to use crossplay, and the anti cheat, well... sadly, a lot of games uses that crap, at least we don't have denuvo, thanks devs. I didn't suffer any crashes of super bad drop of performance even if my pc has some weird specs.
The gameplay can feel imprecise at some points, I'm speaking about parrying some attacks, dodging, besides of repetitive, as I said, I don't mind this, because I just enjoy how fun it is anyway.
The length of the whole package, I am happy with it but, maybe some people is expecting more content, if you see the roadmap there will be more content in the future but this isn't a life service game (thanks lord Emperor) so don't expect seasonal huge updates. Let's see how the devs manage the dlc content, I think it will be all just cosmetics but we will see...

Overall, I enjoyed this game, I had my doubts honestly, the first trailers looked too good, and after playing I can say Saber delivered a good game and a great sequel.
Thank you, after so many fiascos lately it's nice and refreshing to play a game that it's just fun, faithful to the source, made with care and dedication.

Brings you back, to Saturday evenings, with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mics and the heat hitting your back.
Weren't they the best gaming memories we have? Just raw fun.

For fun games, FOR THE EMPEROR!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COURAGE AND HONOR

The game excels in recapturing the essence of the 2000s and 2010s gaming era with impressive authenticity. The combat system and movement mechanics are exceptionally well-crafted, delivering a gratifying and dynamic experience. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular, offering a visually stunning presentation. While the storyline may not be revolutionary, it remains sufficiently compelling and engaging to sustain the player's interest.

The game made me like Ultramarines, I'm still not sure how to feel about that

An excellent third-person shooter that immerses players in the Warhammer 40k universe.
I'd say the game is a bit pricey for its current content, but a roadmap has already been released with content through to the end of 2025.

The single-player campaign, is the sequel to the first opus and can be played solo or in co-op for up to 3 players. It's really good, but rather short (I'd say 8 hours of play).

Then there's a less scripted co-op campaign where you can customize your space marine and play different classes. It's fairly short, but is designed to be played several times to improve your characters.

There is also the 6vs6 PvP mode, which is really cool. Progression is pretty good, and you want to keep playing to unlock the next weapons and cosmetics, but unfortunately there are only 3 maps and 3 game modes at the moment.

In conclusion, I'd recommend it to all fans of the 40k universe or anyone looking for a good shooter, but I'd advise you to buy it at a reduced price or wait for the developers to add a little more content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good co-op shooter that desperately need more content.

Satisfying gunplay, good melee combat, great graphics.
The campaign is average and short but still well worth playing.
Co-op operations are fun but we need lot more of them.
PVP I personally don't care and will never play it.



Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a good game but there's not enough content atm.
The gameplay is good but it's sadly a bit repetitive after a while.
The operations are highly replayable, thanks to the different classes which are all fun to play but there is sadly not enough maps right now. I'm max rank with best weapons on Vanguard, Assault, Tactical and Sniper so there's not much left to do in the game for me now.

As it currently stands I must say that games like Darktide, Exoprimal, Earth Defense Force or Warframe for examples are way better survival/horde co-op games simply because they provide lot more replay value.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a worthy addition to your survival/horde/co-op games collection, Saber did a good job with this one and I'm very hyped to see what future content they have in store for us in the future.

The campaign is short, but the pacing is incredible. Even more so than the first game. I didn't feel like there was any padding, it's just set piece after set piece, so keep that in mind when figuring out your $/hr figure.

Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 â€?There is only war,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nachdem ich nun sÃ¤mtliche Missionen des Spiels abgeschlossen habe und mich im PVP verprÃ¼geln lassen habe (ich habe aber auch gut ausgeteilt), werd ich erneut meine EindrÃ¼cke mit euch teilen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Die Story,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Planet Kadaku â€?ein verschlÃ¼sselter Notruf wird Ã¼ber einen Cogitator gesendet, Bedrohung â€?Tyranniden, Strategischer Wert auf Kadaku...Absolut. Die Nachricht wird ausgesendet und nahe KrÃ¤fte antworten. Ein Team von Astartes wird ausgesandt um sich der Bedrohung zu stellen...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Space Marine 2 ist ein Third-Person-Shooter, wo Ihr entweder allein oder in einem Team von 3, durch die Horden von Tyranniden durchschieÃŸt oder schlachtet. Als nun Leutnant Titus der Ultramarines wird die Geschichte um Ihn und Ihm herum weiter erzÃ¤hlt und setzt neben durchschlagskÃ¤ftigen Boltern auch verschiedene Nahkampfwaffen wie Kampfmesser. Ã„hnlich wie im ersten Teil werdet Ihr von Horden der Tyranniden angegriffen, welche aber nicht nur als Horma/Termaganten auftreten (welche den GroÃŸteil des Schwarms ausmachen), sondern auch Tyranniden Krieger und oder andere gefÃ¤hrlichere Aliens auf Euch losgehen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Der Nahkampf von Space Marine 2 wurde hier Ã¼berarbeitet und es kommt sehr hÃ¤ufig zu Duellen zwischen euch und den grÃ¶ÃŸeren Tyranniden. Neben schnellen SchlÃ¤gen, kÃ¶nnt Ihr starke SchlÃ¤ge austeilen, die euren Gegner betÃ¤uben kÃ¶nnen und euch so etwas mehr Luft zum atmen verschaffen. Sollte dies keine Option sein kÃ¶nnt Ihr auch rennen und Ausweichrollen einsetzen, um so Distanz aufzubauen oder euch aus einer umzingelten Situation befreien. Wer aber den Zweikampf sucht, so bietet euch das Spiel nun die MÃ¶glichkeit Attacken zu parieren und zu kontern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gespielt habe ich mit 2 Freunden auf dem hÃ¶chsten Schwierigkeitsgrad und ich muss sagen, dass es deutlich schwerer war als der erste Teil. KÃ¤mpfe sind intensiver und man hat weniger MÃ¶glichkeiten sich zu heilen. Gerade der Nahkampf ist recht gewÃ¶hnungsbedÃ¼rftig, da man recht schnell zerfetzt werden kann und das kontern echt gelernt sein muss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nach der Story bietet euch das Spiel eine Parallelstory, die ebenfalls in der Story sich abspielt aber nicht durch Titus`s Squad durchgefÃ¼hrt werden. In diesem PvE-Modus stehen euch nun 6 Klassen, wie der â€œeinfacheâ€?Tactical, ScharfschÃ¼tze oder dem Bulwark zur VerfÃ¼gung, die Ihr nach Euren Vorstellungen anpassen kÃ¶nnt und auch im Level aufsteigen. Im fortgeschrittenem Level habt Ihr die MÃ¶glichkeit Perks freizuschalten, um so auch ein Alleinstellungsmerkmal fÃ¼r die Klassen zu generieren, nicht nur durch Ihre Bewaffnung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Auch eure Waffen kÃ¶nnen etwas aufgewertet werden, welche KlassenÃ¼bergreifend (Falls diese Klasse Zugriff hat) sind. Wie Ihr euch auch entscheidet, haben Sie entweder mehr Durchschlagskraft, mehr Munition oder sind einfach prÃ¤ziser.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Der PVP-Modus bietet derzeit 3 Spielmodi â€?Deathmatch, Capture the Flag und King of the Hill, alle teambasiert. Auch hier habt Ihr die 6 Klassen zur VerfÃ¼gung und eure Astartes kÃ¶nnen optisch etwas angepasst werden, wobei die Chaos Astartes sehr stiefmÃ¼tterlich behandelt werden derzeit. Die Modi liefen alle soweit sehr rund, nur finde ich das der Nahkampf etwas lasch erscheint, dass ich keinen Schaden mache. Das kommt daher das der Gegner entweder schwer ins Wanken gebracht oder an dem schlechten Trefferfeedback. An sich kommt es dem Space Marine 1 PVP schon gut nahe und wir werden abwarten was noch so kommt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Es ist Crossplay vorhanden, Ihr werdet auch mit euren Leuten Spielen kÃ¶nnen die das Spiel auf der Xbox oder Playstation spielen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ich bin auf einige kleine Bugs gestoÃŸen, wie einige Grafik/Soundbugs. Hin und wieder konnte ich keine Eingaben machen, da musste ich des Ã¶fteren aus dem Spiel raus und rein Tabben. Ansonsten liefen die Server recht solide, hin und wieder kam es zu kleineren StÃ¶rungen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gespielt wird mit Maus und Tastatur oder wahlweise Controller. Die Standardeinstellung der Tastatur war etwas fragwÃ¼rdig, ist aber kein Problem da diese geÃ¤ndert werden kann. Es lieÃŸ sich sehr flÃ¼ssig sowohl mit Maus+Tastatur spielen als auch mit dem Controller. Ich empfehle aber dennoch die regulÃ¤ren EingabegerÃ¤te da man einfach prÃ¤ziser ist und ich denke auch schneller reagieren kann, ist aber Geschmackssache. Das Kontern muss hier definitiv gelernt werden, da das Zeitfenster echt knapp ist und das Timing stimmen muss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ein absoluter Ohr-gassmus, Ãœberall wird geschossen, es explodiert was, Bolterfeuer, Kettenschwerter, der Ansturm von Tyranniden und dazu diese epische Orchester im Hintergrund. Es trifft Grim-dark genau ins schwarze und man hat nicht das GefÃ¼hl man schieÃŸt mit Erbsenkanonenâ€?AuÃŸer das Astra Militarum natÃ¼rlich...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Space Marine 2 hat einen sehr groÃŸen Sprung vom ersten Teil gemacht, sehr schÃ¶n detailierte Grafiken, Tyranniden sehen super aus und vorallem unsere Astartes. Blut und Schlamm setzt sich an der RÃ¼stung ab, im Hintergrund kommt eine Horde Tyranniden an und man stellt fest â€Ohh ****, dass sind echte Gegner!â€?die da auf einen zukommen und versuchen die WÃ¤nde hochzuklettern und kein schÃ¶n animierter Hintergrund um uns den Krieg so nah wie mÃ¶glich zu bringen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rosarote Brille ab, alles im allem Macht Space Marine 2 sehr viel richtig, ist aber sehr kurz. Nach ungefÃ¤hr 18 Stunden haben wir bereits alle Missionen abgeschlossen und haben dann nur noch dieselben Missionen fÃ¼rs aufleveln gespielt. Es gibt noch recht wenig Content fÃ¼rs Geld wie ich finde und sage daher, dass man auf einen Rabatt warten sollte. Je lÃ¤nger Ihr wartet um so flÃ¼ssiger lÃ¤uft auch das Spiel im nachhinein," es muss noch etwas feintuning erleben. Eine Roadmap fÃ¼r kommenden Content ist vorhanden weshalb diese Review hier nur grundlegendes erlÃ¤utern soll. Alles im allem empfehle ich uneingeschrÃ¤nkt weiter.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ce jeu est un banger tout azimuth.
D'avance : Oubliez les avis des streamers, oubliez les avis des casus qui s'attendent Ã  avoir tout a portÃ©e de main sans rien faire. C'est ni le jeu pour, ni l'univers pour.
Si vous avez fait le premier Warhammer: Space Marine, un seul mot d'ordre : Foncez. Pour l'Empereur.

Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 est dÃ©finitivement le digne successeur du prÃ©cÃ©dent opus.
- Vous trouviez des lacunes graphiques au premier ? BalayÃ©.
- Vous aviez l'impression d'Ãªtre toujours tout seul dans un univers immense ? Oubliez.
- Vous avez fait le tour du premier en vous disant que c'Ã©tait plutÃ´t arcade avec une difficultÃ© un peu claquÃ© ? Oubliez Ã©galement, Ici, on tryhard. Les tyrannides sont rÃ©ellement nombreux, et les agents du chaos tapent lourd
- Vous Ãªtes fan des vidÃ©os fanmades Astartes ? Ici on monte encore d'un cran.

Un peu Ã  l'image de DOOM Eternal, vous pourriez vous arrÃªter devant divers plans de combats au loin tellement le dÃ©cor est dynamique. Aux premiers abords vous pouvez vous dire ""Haha, sur un millier de tyrannides j'en aurai que 10"". Non, pas de tromperies, vous allez rÃ©ellement vous manger des hordes en temps et en heure.

A contrario des casus qui disent que la campagne est terminable en 6h (en jouant en easy et en rushant, Ã©videmment). Comptez 10h pour tenter de la boucler en vÃ©tÃ©ran, et un peu plus de 20h en ange de la mort (soit ""Pas moins que le premier opus""). La difficultÃ© est lÃ , et la coopÃ©ration est de mise. Vous Ãªtes en perpÃ©tuel mouvement dans une invasion d'un vaisseau ruche qui est lÃ  pour vous Ã©radiquer.

Les opÃ©rations viennent complÃ©ter le scÃ©nario puisque ce sont des missions d'escouades annexes aux missions de Titus, vous permettant de dÃ©couvrir de nouveaux objectifs, et pour votre plus grand plaisir : de nouveaux boss.

Vous vous souvenez du lore du 1 ? Soyez prÃªts pour le scÃ©nario dÃ©ployÃ© par le 2.


Tout Ã§a pour dire :
+ DÃ©finitivement un banger pour un studio AA
+ Le lore, le scÃ©nario, les cinÃ©matiques, les graphismes sont monstrueux
/ On pourrait couiner sur la linÃ©aritÃ©, mais trÃ¨s clairement vu la qualitÃ© dÃ©ployÃ© avec 13 ans d'attente, c'est rÃ©ellement un dÃ©tail.
- La courbe d'apprentissage des combos et techniques n'est pas linÃ©aire. Il va falloir cracher du sang au dÃ©part pour monter dans les difficultÃ©s.

Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine II Review
Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine II is the continuation of Space Marine I, where we will follow Titus as he faces off against the forces of evil that threaten the Imperium. The game uses a gameplay skeleton reminiscent of Gears of War but finds its identity thanks to some clever differences that encourage risky playstyles.

The game adds new elements and improvements to build upon its predecessor, while other elements remain the same such as story mode being a bit short and leaving players wanting more. Enemies now have multiple approaches to battle as they can swarm players, attack from a distance, or even inflict status such as slowing them down or corruption from chaos foes.

The main reason to get the game is to see the continuation of Space Marine I since it ends in a cliffhanger when it is getting good. The story is well done, illustrating the world of 40K similarly to the audiobooks but with visuals and interactive gameplay. Voice actors do a great job and there is mention of important figures in the lore along with some surprising appearances.



The game is hard in terms of difficulty, embracing a high-risk high-reward gameplay where one has to mow down obnoxious amounts of enemies while trying to survive and accomplish the objectives of the mission. The gore is satisfactory as executions are graphical and smooth, resulting in enemies popping up like toys on screen. These executions are also reinforced by the graphics and the fact that enemies that one sees in the distance can be attacked like they are real enemies rather than ambiance. Is always a show to see the Tyranids make their way to you from a distance.

The core gameplay is similar to Gears of Wars, you have dodges, melee attacks and range weapons. Where Space Marine II creates a distinction is that while Gears uses smart use of cover, this game lacks it, resulting in having to take high-risk maneuvers to succeed and parrying with great skill. As you take damage, you can recover HP if you inflict damage back, and executions restore armor and HP if you do them swiftly after taking damage. Thus, the game encourages a ""hit them harder than they hit you"" style where you keep the pressure on the enemy and the action never stops.



The Weapons such as the Power Sword are very fun to use, They feature a power mode and a speed mode making them versatile and useful against swarms, while abilities like the Jetpack give a lot of maneuverability and exploration options. All the weapons pack a punch and you can use what goes best with your playstyle, whether that be gun blazing, swords, chainsaw-swords, flamethrowers, or sniper rifles with lasers.

In my experience, I found the controller more comfortable than the mouse and keyboard (don't laugh at me!) but both options are solid. The reason for the controller is that the developers seem to have made an extra effort to make it more natural and easier to move around and parry enemies with it. ""But the aiming!"" my brother gamer, is a third-person action shooter, not an FPS, I rather have good movement than aim.

I played the camping solo and this is the part where I tell you the game has flaws. First of all, no matchmaking for the campaign, in 2024?! Seems like a mistake. Secondly, the bots are downright useless for the most part, they do not do objectives and they don't help a lot. The bots were so bad, that I had to lower the difficulty of the game, and this has been recognized by the developers who had stated they would tone down Veteran due to the incompetence of the bots. Other than that the game is very good and enjoyable. (I love my battle brothers but still fix the bots a bit).

A normal run of the campaign is around 8-12 hours depending on how good you are and what difficulty you choose. The game features a PvE mode and a PvP one giving it more shelf life in your library. Both modes are great, as PvE sees you tackling new missions through different perspectives while PvP has a couple of modes where you face off against other space marine players. They are both solid and add a foundation for future updates to the game.



Speaking of updates, the game will get a new Horde mode next year (cannot escape the comparisons to Gears of War heh?) which is great, because I believe in the long run what this game will need is an addictive fun mode like Horde, alongside with good PvP to keep it alive (and if we can get a DLC story down the great line, I am not looking forward to waiting another 13 years for Space Marine III haha!) With more updates and time, the game could easily next 50-100 hours of gameplay on the average player.

For 60 bucks I consider it a fair deal, you get a fantastic story in a quality game with great graphics, devs that will support the title moving forward with new content, and space marine action. I mean, nothing beats being a behemoth of destruction fighting for the Emperor while burning down your enemies to a cinder. The extra modes add more playtime and the personalization that you can do to your character post-game in the extra modes is sweet as you can choose from different chapters and personalize your space marine to your liking.

Space Marine II is a great game that despite having the opportunity to be an amazing title, gets held back by some limitations to the solo experience, a lack of matchmaking, and a short story. In due time, the game will become even better, and it is a short but sweet ride of a fantastic entry in the 40K universe. That being said, Saber Interactive, please don't make me wait another 13 years for the sequel to this game, and make the story mode a bit longer next time! If you enjoy Warhammer, get it. If you like 40K get it too. If you are into action games, consider getting it, but you can also wait until the title is injected with more quality-of-life updates and new content. The Emperor protects!

8/10 GREAT

Sorprendentemente el juego me esta encantando, en lo personal este es mi primer contacto con la saga Warhammer en general, nunca habÃ­a probado uno y este me sorprendiÃ³ para bien.

OptimizaciÃ³n Excelente 10/10
GrÃ¡ficamente el juego se ve Excelentemente bien, a pesar de tener tantas cosas en pantalla, puedes distinguir a cada uno de los elementos al todos tener un contorno muy bien definido.

En cuanto Historia a pesar de no saber respecto al lore del juego, esta siendo bastante buena hasta el momento y el hecho de que puedas jugarlo en modo Coop con amigos, le aÃ±ade un plus ya que se vuelve mucho mas divertido.

En cuanto multijugador, es bueno pero necesita pulirse bastante cuanto zonas de respawns, zonas cerradas, vida general y equilibrar mas las clases, creo que podrÃ­a quedar un multijugador bastante decente si retocan estos aspectos.

En general, juego bastante bastante bueno, dirÃ­a que vale su precio para todo lo que te ofrece, es bastante re jugable, mas contenido extra al por venir y ademas si te gusta el multijugador ya tendrÃ­as muchas mas horas de juego.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have no background in the Warhammer 40k or Warhammer universes in general, but this was a fantastic campaign, very fun and I was invested in Titus and the rest of the cast of characters' stories. I am interested in learning more about the 40k lore because of the game. I can't wait to get into the other game modes and replay missions with friends!

''BURN THE HERETIC, KILL THE MUTANT, PURGE THE UNCLEAN'' - Angels of Death.

Jokes aside, this game is everything the Warhammer 40k: Space Marine community has been hoping for. Not only does it serve as a solid sequel to the previous title, but it also sends a clear message to the gaming industry: players are craving shorter, simpler games that deliver high quality and polish. Hereâ€™s what it brings to the table:

Intense Combat: The seamless blend of gunplay and melee combat keeps the action dynamic and engaging throughout.

Visuals and Environment Design: The graphical upgrades and meticulous attention to detail provide an impressive visual experience.

Immersive Storyline: The game draws you into the dystopian Warhammer 40k universe with a mature narrative that revolves around epic battles.

Challenging Enemy Hordes: Facing off against the Tyranids adds an extra layer of difficulty, requiring constant movement and strategic thinking. And let's not forget the heretic traitorsâ€”on higher difficulty levels, theyâ€™re formidable opponents that force you to rethink your strategy.

Stunning Art Direction: Itâ€™s often overlooked, but the art direction in this game is phenomenal. From sprawling battlefield scenes to towering cathedrals, every building and wall feels like a piece of art. The combat may keep you too busy to notice, but when you get a moment to take it all in, itâ€™s hard not to be impressed.

That said, there are a few caveats:

Potential Repetitiveness: Depending on your progression, the horde combat can start to feel repetitive.

Campaign Length: The campaign is fairly standard in length and varies with difficulty, but the narrative remains compelling throughout.

All in all, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 serves as a beacon for the industry, proving that you donâ€™t need groundbreaking innovations to create a great game. Sometimes, a bit of refinement to an already solid formula is all it takes. Thatâ€™s my take on the gameâ€”I hope this helps you decide whether itâ€™s worth a playthrough! :)

I updated the review because my English was sounding a bit like C3PO's. Anyway, thanks for the support!!!",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Review After 100% Achievements

Coming from someone who has little to no Warhammer 40k knowledge or experience, I had an awesome time playing through the story and operations in Space Marine 2! I just obtained all achievements after finishing the game this weekend in the early access launch period, and Iâ€™m glad to finally have this one done after grinding xp and kills for hours on hours. Space Marine 2 has pretty much three different branches of content; the Main Story Campaign, Operations (PvE), and Eternal War Mode (PvP). For me personally, the campaign was goodâ€¦not bad but not great. Eternal War has potential but there isnâ€™t a whole lot of variety with 3 maps and 3 game modes at launchâ€?I know in the roadmap there is more planned which is great! The Operations were the highlight of my time with the game. Character customization and class progression feels killer, and I really liked the different difficulties. Visually the game looks amazing, performance wise I did have a few crashes/freezes and some connection issues when connecting to others. Crossplay worked decent during the campaign and operations, but I really wish there was a way to turn on/off cross-play in PvP since Iâ€™d love to team up with my brother who plays on his PS5. Overall, the hunt for the grindy achievements like maxing out a class or killing 41k enemies was what fueled my desire to complete this game and it feels great to add this one to the list!

Achievement Count: 50
Time to 100%: ~40hrs
Difficulty: â˜…â˜…â˜…âœ©âœ?Genre of Game: Action, Multiplayer, Third-Person
Fun Rating: 7/10

I bought this on 9.th september.

Campaign in around 10 hours is fine with around 6 extra for operations, but as you want to level your characters to max level the operations have high replayability.

What a good game. It's simple, fun and epic. If you don't know anything about Warhammer 40k, this is a good introduction. If you are already a fan of this universe, you must have this game. Honestly, it might be my GOTY this year.
The emperor protects!


P.D.
Personally, I liked that the campaign wasn't so long with filler and tedious missions. It was intense and focused, something rare these days.
And yes, for now it does not have much content, but that doesn't worry me, because the content can be added later: it is the quality of what they presented to us that can make it goty, They have a solid game on their hands.
My first impression is that this work shows passion, detail and love for the franchise and the first impression is what is worth the most",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Para resumir este game entregou realmente o que foi dito e nÃ£o enganou ninguÃ©m nos trailers divulgados. Para os amantes da franquia como eu sou, vÃ¡ e compre logo, para os nÃ£o amantes bom sugiro pesquisar antes de comprar. Diferente das empresas com viÃ©s e por isso ninguÃ©m mais acredita dando nota 6/10 para este jogo, eu daria daria estas notas para estas categorias baseadas na minha experiÃªncia:

* Campanha : 9 / 10 ( poderiam aumentar levemente essa campanha, meio curta )

* GrÃ¡ficos : 9,5 / 10 ( o rosto dos personagens destoa demais do resto do jogo kkk )

* Performance no meu pc : 9 / 10 ( ryzen 7 7700x com 4070ti)

* End game : 6,5 / 10 ( missÃµes muito bem construÃ­das porÃ©m tem pouquÃ­ssimas missÃµes atÃ© o momento, vamos aguardar o futuro e o PvP estÃ¡ ok )

TL;DR review:
This game is a solid action-shooter romp with fast-paced, exciting combat, an incredibly cinematic campaign, and a surprisingly deep customization and progression system to be found in its co-op and PvP game modes. It is well worth your money and if you're still on the fence, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't pick this entry up when it goes on sale.

Space Marine 2 is one of those rare cases where a game is made as an unabashed love letter to its predecessor, and in a surprise twist, it does more than match the original -- it surpasses it in almost every way.

This is particularly impressive if you consider that SM2 is the sequel to a cult classic title that was largely slept on when it was originally released. The original had all the makings of an outstanding game, but for as phenomenal as its gameplay was and as glowing as its reviews tended to be, it unfortunately neither sold well nor gained enough traction to popularize it after its release. It's also one of my favorite games of all time.

takes everything that made the original stand out and amplifies the oomph by a factor of wowza -- which is to say, it's a damned fine game, developed by a studio that not only understood their assignment -- to make a game worthy of being called a sequel -- they utterly aced all expectations. Without further ado, let's jump into what makes this game so good!

+ is not one of your dinky four hour Call of Duty campaigns with a plot as deep as the shallow end of a pool and the characterization of a pack of wild chimps -- it's a fully-featured, action-packed and highly-cinematic 10+ hour experience. I would almost compare the overall scope, scale and feel of the campaign as one very long Hollywood action movie. But like... you know, an actually good one.
+ SM2's 3-player cooperative PvE mode, expands upon the campaign story by introducing you to three out of a total of six fully-customizable classes in a slew of six exciting co-op missions with randomized spawns and emergent gameplay events (which only increase in number and variety as you scale the game's difficulty levels ever-higher). No two Ops missions play the same, as each one is a full-range map with unique objectives, the occasional MMO raid boss-worthy fight to spice things up, and LITERALLY hundreds (if not thousands) of xenos and heretics standing between you and glory.
+ I haven't had a chance to try out SM2's PvP mode, but my understanding is that it is stacked to similar degrees in terms of replayability when compared against its coop mode.
+ is deep and robust, allowing you to use any of the numerous provided Astartes chapters as a base (or, for the creative hands among us, recreate one of your favorites from beyond the breadth of the game's choices or even put together something homebrew). Each class has its own unique armor that can be customized to the umpteenth degree, ranging from swapping out one or both pauldrons, gauntlets, greaves and more or swapping in a different pattern for each individual armor piece, all of which can be painted just like the war games (and for the tabletoppers among us that just gasped in fright, don't worry -- you have to wait for the primer or paint to dry).
+ is, to be frank, so much deeper than I could have expected going in. Each class comes with a full 25-point perk tree, they all have their own selection of weapons that can be upgraded to perform better or even take on entirely different playstyles (for ranged weapons) or brand new combos and special attacks (for melee weapons), and ALL weapons have two perk trees, some with multiple choice picks to further assist the player in making their loadout truly feel uniquely them.
+ THE COMBAT. If you thought the original had fluid, frenetic combat -- and you SHOULD -- then SM2 is going to throw you through a loop. The good thing is that loop is violent, chaotic, a ton of fun, and greatly expanded upon compared to its predecessor; gone are the days of simply bashing, stomping and smacking your enemies into paste, as the game's melee combat has been completely reworked from ye olde button-smashing to a fully-developed system with blocking, dodging, and attack combos with light, heavy and special attacks. Melee combat at its roots is simple enough to be engaging and serviceable without alienating casual fans, while it is still deep and complex to reward highly-skilled and/or highly-dedicated players through the additions of of perfect dodges and perfect parries.
+ is engaging, as you proceed to tear through veritable roves of lesser enemies while brutally destroying more dangerous fare with visceral melee executions and gun strikes. Combat feels cinematic, it feels responsive, and you can really feel the sheer power and impact of each step, maneuver and strike from your futuristic super soldier of choice. And just as excitingly, the way the game centers around single-handedly demolishing hordes of foes in the high dozens makes any ground you gain feel hard-earned rather than easily-given.
+ The game fully immerses you in the iconic of the grim dark 40th century. I think one thing that even the game's harshest critics can agree on is that, from SM2's gothic-industrial soundtrack, to its crunchy, punchy and visceral visual and sound effects, and large, sweeping, absurdly-detailed grandiose set designs really come together to make you feel like one of the series' titular Space Marines dropped into the middle of all-out war.


- feel somewhat wonky and could use some attention, including outright absurd behavior when it comes to threat priority. This has resulted in mishaps such as grappling into entirely the wrong enemy (""no, no, I totally meant to dropkick that random traitor guard behind the Rubric marine, I swear""), or accidentally locking myself into a particular animation that I cannot cancel in times where I find myself seriously needing to dodge or parry.
- isn't distinct or obvious enough, especially from a distance. Sometimes I'll book it straight past gear and consumables that I didn't manage to spot in the chaos of combat.
- known as 'Blocking', is functionally useless compared to its two alternatives -- Balanced and Fencing. From my understanding the devs are aware of and in agreement with the belief that Blocking weapons need some serious love before they can contend with its cooler, better siblings.

*The looks to be chock full of worthwhile goodies that should breathe new life into the game and enhance its staying power.
*There are Weapon unlocks are entirely achieved through gameplay and cannot be acquired through MTX. Armor unlocks are entirely cosmetic, the vast majority of them are earned through gameplay as well, and they do not affect or alter gameplay in any capacity.
* to play the game or access any of its features. I sure as heck don't. On that note, if you wrote a Big Angy Gamer Review(tm) because you couldn't be bothered to read before you click things, you're bad, you should feel bad and if you haven't yet, you'd better go change your review to something positive before Santa poops in your holiday stockings. You dingleberry.

EDIT: Updated strictly for the sake of unlocking the Steam Awards achievement. Game is still very, very good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been reading, playing, and loving Warhammer since I was 12. I've read the entire Horus Heresy among many other novels. I have played countless games up to and including Space Marine 1. When I saw the first Tyranid swarm at the start of this game I got emotional because I knew they did it right. It looks right. It feels right. And it plays right.

Play this game.

Know no fear, space marine. For in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simply Goated. I haven't played a game that feels this great off the bat in a while. feels like im playing a prime era xbox360/PS3 game. its an instant classic. great story, I would love some story DLC in the future. PVE is super replayable and fun with mates. PVP is simple, needs a we bit of balancing tho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game knows exactly what it represents and doesn't shy away from doing so. They know exactly who the target audience is. Just from the tutorial alone, I could tell that this was a game made by fans for fans of the franchise. So much love and care went into it. It's 2024 and they don't make games like this anymore where Masculinity, Honor, Duty, Loyalty, Comradery and Brotherhood are depicted in such a captivating and influential way. These are qualities that the modern world and the modern game's industry forgot about. This is Warhammer and it remains true and unapologetic to its identity. They absolutely nailed it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Transcription vox dâ€™un Space Marine aprÃ¨s avoir expÃ©rimentÃ© Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FrÃ¨res, Ã©coutez mes paroles, car je viens de traverser une expÃ©rience qui pourrait presque Ã©galer la gloire du champ de bataille rÃ©el. J'ai jouÃ© Ã  un divertissement de l'Imperium, nommÃ© **Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DÃ¨s lâ€™instant oÃ¹ jâ€™ai pris en main le contrÃ´le du Space Marine dans ce simulacre, jâ€™ai senti une puissance familiÃ¨re, celle de notre armure Ã©nergÃ©tique, fidÃ¨le et lourde, chaque pas rÃ©sonnant avec une intensitÃ© Ã©crasante. Les dÃ©veloppeurs de ce jeu ont capturÃ© avec prÃ©cision l'honneur et la terreur qui accompagnent le port d'une armure Mark VII. Le combatâ€?ah, frÃ¨res ! Chaque coup dâ€™Ã©pÃ©e tronÃ§onneuse vibre dâ€™une vÃ©ritÃ© brutale, chaque tir de bolter frappe avec la force de lâ€™Empereur Lui-mÃªme. Ils ont compris ce que cela signifie de mener une guerre sainte contre les xenos et les hÃ©rÃ©tiques.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Les ennemis que j'ai affrontÃ©s, ces dÃ©testables Tyranides, Ã©taient nombreux et fÃ©roces. Leur carnage sans fin mâ€™a rappelÃ© les guerres sur Macragge. Le jeu capture parfaitement la frÃ©nÃ©sie de leurs assauts, te forÃ§ant Ã  tenir ta ligne, Ã  utiliser chaque bolt et chaque coup avec prÃ©cision. Tu ressens lâ€™urgence, car comme dans la rÃ©alitÃ©, je savais que le devoir nous transcende. Mais la tension, frÃ¨resâ€?la tension Ã©tait palpable, chaque bataille une Ã©preuve de foi et d'acier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Le visuel de ce jeu est une vÃ©ritable ode Ã  lâ€™Imperium. Des citadelles imposantes, bordÃ©es de statues d'anges et de reliques sacrÃ©es, jusqu'aux vastes champs de bataille oÃ¹ le sang et la boue se mÃ©langentâ€?tout respire le 41e millÃ©naire. Chaque dÃ©tail semble bÃ©ni par les TechnoprÃªtres de Mars, une fidÃ©litÃ© telle que lâ€™on croirait marcher sur les propres mondes de l'Empereur.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Et la musique ! FrÃ¨res, elle rÃ©sonne comme les cantiques des chapelains avant la bataille. Elle tâ€™emmÃ¨ne au-delÃ  des limites de la chair, te poussant Ã  te battre encore plus ardemment pour lâ€™HumanitÃ©. Chaque note semble renforcÃ©e par la foi en notre saint Empereur-Dieu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Je vous le dis sans hÃ©sitation : ce jeu est une bÃ©nÃ©diction, une maniÃ¨re honorable pour ceux qui ne peuvent encore rejoindre nos rangs de comprendre ce que cela signifie d'Ãªtre un Astartes. Que vous soyez aspirants, servants de l'Imperium, ou mÃªme simples citoyens, **Warhammer 40, de notre devoir sacrÃ©.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FrÃ¨res, si vous avez du temps Ã  consacrer en dehors du combat rÃ©el, alors jouez Ã  ce jeu. Car il vous rappellera la gloire de notre mission, le poids de notre armure, et la grandeur de servir l'Empereur.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combat system is going to feel completely clunky at first. Took me damn near half the campaign where it finally clicked and I started getting downed much much less while staying in the thick of it. I'm having a blast with it so far as I'm new to the WH40k series. Honestly worth my purchase. Completed the campaign, a great cinematic experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of my review, I've done everything there is to do in PVE. I've gotten every class to 25, unlocked every perk, leveled every weapon to relic tier, unlocked every mastery point for each weapon, unlocked every heraldry, unlocked every cosmetic (through operations - 35 successful missions per class), and beat every operation on ruthless. Also beat the campaign, which I enjoyed.

The moment to moment gameplay is fun and rewarding as there is a skill element to maximizing your offense. Parry and Perfect dodge are great additions. All of the combat mechanics combined make grinding for unlocks in operations more of a fun journey than a chore, at least for me.

For those wondering about campaign length. It's approximately 7 hours give or take, and if you are on harder difficulties, you may find that to be longer. When you combine that with the Operations that tie into the story, that buffs it up to the 10-12 hour range.

Doing all the operations on ruthless difficulty (current max) and soloing them all was a really fun challenge, but it's not required.

EDIT: I've now played a ton of PVP (still ranking up) and I'm having a blast. At max Veterancy Level (25), I've played 100s of matches. The PVP is quite good, but it suffers from map variety. The balance is actually quite good, and there are plenty of strategies and counter strategies appearing as players get more experienced.

Overall, great game, I didn't run into any major issues, all of the classes are fun (and will be funner when a few small bugs are fixed). Emailed the devs and they mentioned a few of the bugs that I had submitted have already been addressed. I'll report back with my findings.

RE: Hours played: I was in both the preview and review periods of the game (which was about a month or so) which is why I have a considerable amount of hours. Not ALL of the hours were 100% playtime of course... things like setting up scenarios for videos, capturing footage, editing... but I would say I probably have at least 300+ hours of playtime in the game.


EDIT: 12900k/3090ti. Decent machine. Plays well. Performance was solid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game is fun, don't get me wrong but for Â£55 what you get is a campaign that only took 7 hours and 6 operations is very small amount of content for that price. Multiplayer is great and can't complain. Hopefully the future content makes it worthwhile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know I going to be on the unpopular side here, but I just want anyone thinking of buying the game to get the chance to see a review that tells it like it is.

I have never played a 40k game before, so without any passion or connection to the universe, I only can judge this game off of what it provides to me. This game is... not horrible, but it certainly isn't great either.

The campaign is short. Very short by today's standards. Like 6 hours, short. I finished in one sitting after work. Now, this isn't horrible, but it since the campaign is arguably the best part of the game, it being that short doesn't really bode well. Fun combat, great visuals, and an entertaining story... that you'll be done with at the end of the day.

Multiplayer is, well, not as great. The operations are interesting at best, monotonous at worst. You essentially get to play through a co-op mission of the campaign as the ""B-team"" that you would always order to go do stuff. It provides an interesting and new perspective, but is certainly nothing great. The ""endless"" war multiplayer, I.E the PvP, is fun for about, well, 2 days. Afterwards you realize you only have 3 game modes on 3 maps. It gets repetitive instantly.

Now I know what you're gonna say, ""oh but there will be updates, and look at the roadmap!"". My brother, you are paying $60 at least for a 6 hour campaign and lackluster multiplayer that you will get tired of in two days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was fighting a HARD boss on the HARDEST DIFFICULTY and after multiple tries I finally had him on the ropes, then I get this LIVE SERVICE NONSENSE causing me LOST PROGRESS.

PrÃ³s:
+ A campanha, apesar de curta, Ã© bem fod@.
+ As armaduras parecem realmente pesadas e isso reflete no combate. VocÃª sente o peso na gameplay.
+ O combate Ã© intenso, pesado e lento (no bom sentido) e por isso Ã© quase que estratÃ©gico. O combate de Space Marine 2 lembra um pouco Gears of War e Darksiders 1. Uma pegada meio old school.
+ Horda de inimigos.
+ Modo COOP. VocÃª pode jogar a campanha inteira em coop. VocÃª + 2 amigos.
+ Excelente DireÃ§Ã£o de Arte. Os cenÃ¡rios sÃ£o lindÃ­ssimos.
+ Bons grÃ¡ficos.
+ Boa trilha sonora.
+ Esse jogo tem mais testosterona que todos os jogos da Ubisoft juntos.
+ A lacraÃ§Ã£o da ""Games Workshop"" (empresa responsÃ¡vel pela franquia Warhammer e que hoje abraÃ§ou a cultura woke com forÃ§a) nÃ£o chegou em Space Marine 2, jogo desenvolvido pela Saber Interactive. EntÃ£o Space Marine 2 RESPEITA a LORE da franquia.

Contras:
- Campanha curta. A campanha pode durar de 6~10h, dependendo da dificuldade e a forma como vocÃª joga.
- Os efeitos de sangue, quando vocÃª atira nos inimigos ou despedaÃ§a eles Ã© muito cartoonesco. Podia ser um pouco mais realista. Mas isso Ã© sÃ³ questÃ£o de gosto pessoal mesmo. Mas o gore do jogo ainda Ã© muito bom.
- Apesar de uma quantidade muito boa de horda de inimigos, eles tem poucas variaÃ§Ãµes.
- O modo ""OperaÃ§Ãµes"" (PVE) e ""Eternal War"" (PVP) sÃ£o apenas repetiÃ§Ãµes. Se quiser estender as horas de jogo vocÃª vai jogar esses modos atÃ© cansar. Para aqueles que, assim como eu, nÃ£o se importam com o PVP, jÃ¡ Ã© menos conteÃºdo ainda.
- EdiÃ§Ãµes Gold e Ultra (sÃ£o claramente conteÃºdos retirados do jogo base pra poder vender essas ediÃ§Ãµes estÃºpidas por um preÃ§o exorbitante)
- Season Pass. E as Seasons que estÃ£o por vir. SÃ£o mais conteÃºdos retirados do jogo base, afim de estender a vida Ãºtil do jogo.
- PASSE DE BATALHA em jogo SINGLEPLAY Ã© de CAIR O CUH DO PALHAÃ‡O!
- Pagar pra jogar antes. O famigerado Early Access (ou early unlock). Ubisoft e EA fazendo escola.

VocÃª quer esperar atÃ© 2025 pra jogar o jogo completo? FaÃ§a isso. Mas jogue! Vale muito a pena.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fantastic return to form for 3D third person shooters. A glorious comeback for the Space Marine franchise. The beautiful details to the environment, weapons, lore; it's all there and faithful. One of the most fun I've had, I'd dare say the best 40k game to date (makes me want an Imperial Guard game by these guys). A complete package of PvE and PvP with all future content free. The season pass only holding cosmetics. No pesky microtransactions, time savers, or any other games as service BS. The devs listening and bringing updates and changes upon what the audience as a whole seem to resonate with is also a breath of fresh air.

The fact the game can still be played in ""offline"" mode is a godsend in itself and a rarity for many a-game in 2024.

My only real complaints are things that can be changed & fixed with time. The bugs in the experience (I've had a few crashes).
The other is the lack of customization for the Chaos Space Marines minus paints and decals. I do see segments for pre-built armor sets, but who knows, maybe they'll open customization to it in the future if the game continues move forward. This game has 2 million players (and growing) at the time of this review.

FOR THE EMPEROR

---{ GrÃ¡ficos }---
â˜?EsqueÃ§a o que Ã© real, entre em um campo de batalha glorioso
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - grÃ¡ficos que fariam atÃ© o Imperador derramar uma lÃ¡grima digital
â˜?Bom, mas nÃ£o para conquistar galÃ¡xias
â˜?Decente, se vocÃª nÃ£o tiver padrÃµes muito altos
â˜?Ruim, tipo um sketch feito no escuro
â˜?NÃ£o olhe muito ou sua alma pode ser corrompida
â˜?MS-DOS... mas com orgulho retro

---{ Jogabilidade }---
â˜?Muito bom, mas vocÃª nÃ£o Ã© digno
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - jogabilidade tÃ£o Ã©pica que te faz sentir parte da Crusada
â˜?Funciona, mas nÃ£o vai conquistar planetas
â˜?Mehh, como um servo que perdeu o rumo
â˜?Se preferir, observe a tinta secar, Ã© menos perigoso
â˜?Apenas nÃ£o, vocÃª vai ser banido do ImpÃ©rio

---{ Ãudio }---
â˜?Som celestial digno de um Primarca
â˜?Muito bom, mas sÃ³ se comparado ao hino imperial
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - o Ã¡udio Ã© tÃ£o poderoso que te faz querer marchar para a guerra
â˜?Ã‰ decente, mas falta aquela majestade
â˜?Ruim, como o caos cochichando no seu ouvido
â˜?Agora estou surdo... mas pelo Imperador, valeu a pena

---{ PÃºblico }---
â˜?CrianÃ§as que mal sabem segurar uma espada
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - para guerreiros, herÃ³is e devotos do Imperium
â˜?Adultos normais... sem o sangue do Imperador correndo nas veias
â˜?VovÃ³, se ela for uma Inquisidora em disfarce

---{ Requisitos do PC }---
â˜?VocÃª consegue rodar com um espÃ­rito servo e fÃ© suficiente
â˜?Batata... mas sÃ³ se ela for abenÃ§oada por um Tecno-Sacerdote
â˜?Decente, mas quem precisa de decÃªncia quando se tem devoÃ§Ã£o?
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - poder bruto necessÃ¡rio, mas a glÃ³ria justifica tudo
â˜?Garoto rico ou abenÃ§oado por Marte
â˜?Pergunte Ã  Adeptus Mechanicus se eles tÃªm uma relÃ­quia tecnolÃ³gica para vocÃª

---{ Tamanho do jogo }---
â˜?Disquete, para relembrar os velhos tempos da cruzada
â˜?Antiquado, mas sempre eficiente
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - grande o suficiente para dominar, mas leve como uma bÃªnÃ§Ã£o
â˜?Grande, mas ainda modesto para o ImpÃ©rio
â˜?Vai devorar o seu HD como a fome de um Tirano
â˜?VocÃª vai precisar de um Data Vault para tanto poder

---{ Dificuldade }---
â˜?Pressione 'W' e venÃ§a... ou pereÃ§a
â˜?FÃ¡cil, mas nÃ£o para os fracos de coraÃ§Ã£o
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - desafiador, te transforma de recruta a campeÃ£o do Imperador
â˜?Uso cerebral necessÃ¡rio, mas quem precisa de cÃ©rebro quando tem fÃ©?
â˜?DifÃ­cil, como a vida no 41Âº milÃªnio
â˜?Prepare-se para ser purgado pelo desafio

---{ Moer }---
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - vocÃª vai lutar por cada vitÃ³ria, e cada vitÃ³ria vai valer cada gota de suor
â˜?SÃ³ se vocÃª quiser subir nas fileiras imperiais
â˜?Moagem casual, mas nada digno de uma cruzada
â˜?Moderado, como fazer um chÃ¡ durante uma invasÃ£o
â˜?Muita moagem, como forjar uma armadura de Termi... sozinho
â˜?VocÃª vai precisar renascer para ver o final

---{ HistÃ³ria }---
â˜?Sem histÃ³ria, sÃ³ destruiÃ§Ã£o
â˜?Algumas histÃ³rias, mas nada grandioso
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - histÃ³ria tÃ£o Ã©pica que vocÃª vai sentir o peso do ImpÃ©rio em suas mÃ£os
â˜?Boa, mas nada para perder a cabeÃ§a
â˜?AdorÃ¡vel, tipo um servo fiel
â˜?Vai substituir sua vida, mas quem precisa dela quando vocÃª tem o Imperium?

---{ Hora do jogo }---
â˜?Tempo suficiente para uma pausa rÃ¡pida antes de outra batalha
â˜?Curto, mas glorioso
â˜?MÃ©dio, para uma campanha digna
â˜?Longo, como uma cruzada estelar
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - tempo infinito, porque o dever do Imperador nunca acaba

---{ PreÃ§o }---
â˜?Ã‰ grÃ¡tis! Mas o preÃ§o da sua lealdade Ã© inestimÃ¡vel
â˜?Vale o preÃ§o, cada crÃ©dito imperial
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - um investimento na grandeza do Imperium
â˜?SÃ³ compre se vocÃª tiver crÃ©ditos sobrando
â˜?NÃ£o recomendado, mas o Imperador vai julgar
â˜?Melhor doar seu dinheiro ao Culto Imperial

---{ Erros }---
â˜?Nunca ouvi falar, o jogo Ã© puro como a luz do Imperador
â˜?FOR THE EMPEROR - quase sem falhas, perfeito para servir o Imperador
â˜?Pode haver bugs, mas eles serÃ£o purgados
â˜?ARK: SobrevivÃªncia EvoluÃ­da, aqui quem sobrevive Ã© vocÃª
â˜?O jogo Ã© um zoolÃ³gico de erros... do Caos

Warhammer Space Marine 2, foi para mim o melhor jogo que joguei nos Ãºltimos anos. NÃ£o por ser um jogo que tenta ter um enredo complexo ou algo que tente atingir todos os pÃºblicos e acabe agradando ninguÃ©m. Esse jogo tenta e conseguiu se propor a ser simplesmente um jogo DIVERTIDO. Ele tem um modo companha, PvP e PvE e vocÃª vai se divertir com qualquer um deles.

A campanha Ã© curta, mas nÃ£o significa que Ã© ruim, pois quantidade nÃ£o Ã© qualidade, poucos jogos conseguiram uma campanha longa e boa e sÃ£o memorÃ¡veis atÃ© hoje. A campanha tem inicio, meio e fim, bem explicado e com personagens que vÃ£o te ensinar atravÃ©s de aÃ§Ãµes valores importantes para sua vida real, como honra, dever e sacrifÃ­cio ( e para os mais religiosos a importÃ¢ncia da fÃ© em seu mestre/salvador). A campanha tem uma dificuldade natural, de vocÃª nÃ£o conseguir porÃ©m vocÃª quer continuar.

NÃ£o joguei muito o PvP sÃ³ o suficiente para pegar as conquistas, porÃ©m me diverti bastante o PvP Ã© desbalanceado so que a graÃ§a Ã© que nÃ£o Ã© pay to win, todo mundo tem acesso aos mesmos armamentos, classes e etc. Mapas bem construÃ­dos e fÃ¡ceis de memorizar e jogar.

O PvE Ã© um show a parte com operaÃ§Ãµes que tem co-relaÃ§Ã£o com a campanha, boss fights muito desafiadoras, nÃ­veis de dificuldades bem balanceados e distintos, cada classe que vocÃª escolher tem uma build de aramas e habilidades com estilo de gameplay completamente distintos.

O que me surpreendeu nesse jogo foi a relaÃ§Ã£o da comunidade com os desenvolvedores onde, tudo estÃ¡ sendo resolvido da forma mais rÃ¡pida e justa possÃ­vel sem fan service ou algo do tipo.

Space marine 2 Ã© uma perola do AAA, para quem tava descrente com o mercado de jogos, esse game Ã© a soluÃ§Ã£o. conheci o universo warhammer por causa dele, fiz novos amigos e depois de muito tempo afasto de jogos multiplayer encontrei um onde Ã© saudÃ¡vel investir meu tempo.

ps: NÃƒO TEM MICROTRANSAÃ‡ÃƒO,, ATÃ‰ OS COSMÃ‰TICOS VOCÃŠ TEM QUE COMPRAR COM MOEDAS QUE VOCÃŠ SÃ“ CONSEGUE JOGANDO ASSIM COMO TODO MUNDO :D",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Na primeira vez que eu ouvi falar sobre esse jogo a minha barba cresceu...
Quando eu assisti ao trailer desse jogo minha voz ficou mais grave...
ApÃ³s comprar esse jogo os meus mÃºsculos ficaram maiores...
Depois de instalar esse jogo o desempenho do meu PC melhorou, agora ele solta um rugido ao ligar e emite uma fumaÃ§a preta constante...
Enquanto eu jogo esse jogo no volume mÃ¡ximo a minha rua inteira treme com o som de tiros, explosÃµes, louvores ao Imperador da Humanidade, e gritos de aliens em pÃ¢nico...
Meu vizinho veio reclamar na minha porta: 1 minuto depois ele estava no hospital...
Minha vizinha veio reclamar na minha porta: 1 minuto depois ela estava na minha cama...
Enquanto eu escrevo essa anÃ¡lise e me preparo pra jogar mais, ela estÃ¡ na cozinha fritando um bife pra mim...
Se ela me der filhos, serÃ£o todos meninos grandes, fortes e brutos que vestirÃ£o azul e que comeÃ§arÃ£o a praticar boxe ou MMA desde cedo...
Se ela nÃ£o me der filhos, serei obrigado a encontrar outra...
Pensando no bem estar de nossa famÃ­lia tradicional, jÃ¡ arrumei um emprego de lenhador na SibÃ©ria em meio aos lobos, ursos, tigres, dinossauros e russos barra pesada.
Pensando ainda mais no futuro, irei construir uma cabana no meio do nada, cercada com arame farpado e repleta de armadilhas nas imediaÃ§Ãµes e com uns vira latas caramelo pra espantar estranhos.
LÃ¡ seremos felizes: eu jogando, ela cozinhando.

New patch did indeed fix issues on Linux and steam deck, so I can recommend the game again.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Devs have said that the next patch should fix the issue for Linux and SteamDeck users. Once the patch rolls out and itâ€™s confirmed that it does fix the issue, I can recommend the game again.

As of Patch 3.0, users on linux are unable to play online. It appears to be intentional, as the linux64 EAC binary is no longer published in the modules CDN. Just straight up turned off the linux support checkbox.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wish steam had an in-between option for reviews, because while the gameplay is fun, i don't think it's worth the price with the current level of content. there's a fairly short (6 mission) campaign, 6 operations missions which play out alongside the main campaign, and a barebones PVP mode which is okay. The combat is good but can be a bit janky, especially the melee combat. the control scheme isn't great for mouse & keyboard and was obviously designed with console controllers in mind. I had a few weird bugs, including character/weapon/enemy models becoming invisible & connection issues trying to play operations with a friend, but i appreciate it's still very early days and these will likely be fixed. i'll almost definitely come back to this game in future if/when they add more content, but currently it's far too expensive for what you get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good Sequel

Good Story

Good Gameplay

But I still think the 1st game was better.

PS The EULA will make you download Epic Game store stuff when you agree to it but it can be deleted and will result in a loss of cross play With Epic players.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've hoped for a Warhammer game like this for years! Amazing graphics, gameplay is awesome, story is great etc. Some combat mechanics need some work thats for sure, but man the possibilites for this game are endless!! Ork xpac, drukhari xpac, Necron xpac etc, this game could bring millions of new fans to Warhammer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Greetings Battle-Brothers!
-----------------------------------
Addendum to original submission, due to outrage from Inquisitorial conclave.
-----------------------------------
Let us review the game as a whole (newest update included):
Story:
Excellent, although it seems that some footage from several servo-skulls went missing.
Low initial mission count, supplemented by same number of operations (meant for multiplayer)
Score: 6/10

Visuals:
Relay congratulations to the Artists, Remeberancers and the Tech-Priests.
Score: 10/10

Lore:
As it should be. Personal note: Not sure why a race such as the *Redacted* would have a device that actively empowers warp rifts.
Score: 9/10

Connectivity:
Needs polish. It seems sudden and unpredictable Warp-storms are causing havoc with the Astropathic choir. Sometimes the Astronomican is barely visible.
Battle-Brothers are losing connection and are unable to join their squads, which is endangering mission continuity.
Score: 5/10

Multiplayer:
PvE element fun and satisfying. With several inconsistencies which currently appear to been worked on.
Score: 6/10

PvP element. Found an archeo-tech note which reads ""Not Great, Not Terrible""
Score: *Redacted*

Customization for Space Marines:
It would seem that members of *Redacted* have stolen most other Space Marine Chapters actual Gear.
For now it seems that the Tech-Priests are repainting Ultramarine's armor and presenting it as other Chapters armor. Level of heresy is high, but acceptable until actual armor pieces are found.
Score: 4/10

Summation: Game is good and developers should be praised for what they have created.
With enough polish and additional work it would be an Excellent game. However there are several questionable decisions on release which probably are related to business decisions for content which require to be further scrutinized.
Final score 6.5/10
Original recommendation: Yes

Report submitted to Chief Interrogator.

Post-Update Review
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is my take on the current situation of the game:
- New Level - Very Good
Level design is great, new Bio-Titan is Awesome

- New Difficulty - Report to the Inquisition -
New Enraged status for Majoris is good;

Cohesion ""Leash"" - bordering on Heresy- Snipers, Heavies, Vanguards and especially Assault are getting penalized for their play style. The first too are supposed to be in the back providing fire support, the other two are supposed to be in the tick of it. -
Recommendation: Rethink the design, perhaps based on what classes do best and how they can compliment each other. Positive reinforcement is better than negative.
Examples:
Knife in the Dark -

When the Sniper and the Vanguard are in Proximity range knife damage and/or speed and/or cleaving is increased

Overlapping fields of Fire -
When the Heavy and the Tactical are in close proximity, bolt weapons damage is increased for both Marines.

There! That one! -
When the Tactical and the Sniper are in close proximity Sniper Riles deals significantly more damage to Auxpex Scanned enemies

Thunder and Fury -
When the Assault and Bulwark are in close proximity power weapons deal more damage and/or have increased attack speed

Fangs of Fenris -
When two Marines are in close proximity Chain weapons have increased cleave and/or damage

Shield against the Filth -
When the heavy and the Bulwark are in close proximity the The Iron Halo becomes a sphere and has increased ranged

Downtime after death - High Heresy -
Recommendation: For an action pack game where every second counts 120 seconds should be the absolute maximum no matter what new difficulty is introduced.


Balance changes - High Heresy -
Armor changes - Seems good.
Ammo changes - Seems good.
Recommendation: Reconsider some nerfs except the Tactical's scanner, buff the under-performing weapons instead.

Report submitted to Chief Interrogator.
Until the Heresy Levels are lowered recommendation for the game is a NO.

"Terrible patch. Not thought out. They claim the game is """"too easy"""" and their solution is to nerf the players. If only there was some kind of... swarm engine that was capable of spawning thousands of enemies at a time that they could use to deliver the horde fantasy that was promised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just so everyone is clear, only 15% of the player base has even completed a single tier 4 mission. They made these nerfs knowing this AND releasing 5th tier of difficulty at the same time. Pre-launch the company promised to release patch notes before they went live to receive feedback and they haven't done this a single time. This is what happens when you are out of touch with your player base.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Make marines not paper, make enemies not bullet sponges," make difficulty sliders more enemies and not enemy hp / damage. Buff the 90% of weapons that are unusably bad.

9/10 but can NOT recommend.
This trend of corporatocracy needs to stop. I shouldnt need 3 accounts (steam, epic, saber) with 6 EULAs (steam account, epic account, saber account, in-game EULA, steam purchase EULA, epic service EULA, and maybe more that I forgot) just to have my consumer rights degraded. Forced arbitration, not actually owning the media you buy, and having to run what surmounts to spyware even for single player, battlepasses and predatory monetization everywhere. None of this should be normalized. This game is fun but I can not recommend this game to my friends as I am tired of supporting this regime of predation. And before any commenters say this is hyperbolic or developer PR adds the technical excuses, just remember, games were fun and sold well for the last few decades without all this BS. We live in a golden age of media yet insist on tarnishing it.

P.S. An extra $30 and I still have to grind just to paint my guy purple?! No, thanks. Yes, I know you can run without EGS, but it still installs EGS dependencies. Yes, I know EULAs have existed for a long time, but I still think modern EULAs are predatory. Its amazing how many of you take my opinion so personally and dont understand subtext.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fantastic game bringing back all the memories of couch co-op from the early aughts. With lavish attention to detail and lore accuracy, Space Marine 2 sets a new bar for the Warhammer franchise.

Combat captures all the crunchy melee and weighty ranged weapon feel you'd expect from the 41st millennium. While feeling clunky at first, the gameplay soon becomes a fluid dance as you begin to understand the parry, dodge and gun strike mechanics culminating in a wide array of gory executions. Harder difficulties will provide challenge and invoke some truly triumphant moments for your three man squad.

The campaign is a relatively linear but satisfying romp with some great set pieces and characters that provide a basic depth making completion satisfying.

Operations, where you will likely spend most of your time, has only 6 missions (for now) but the great combat loop and AI director keep you engaged long after multiple replays should begin to feel stale.

6v6 multiplayer has a solid foundation with well designed maps and a decent paper-rock-scissors class system.

If you're a Warhammer fan, Space Marine 2 is a must buy. If you're new to the universe, you'll likely be drawn into the grim dark future where there is only war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Este es el juego que nos merecÃ­amos los Warhammeros de alta alcurnia y rancio abolengo.

Paisajes fieles, diseÃ±os fieles, protagonistas que SON autÃ©nticos Astartes (Bestias genÃ©ticas sobrehumanas con condicionamiento mental y fervor cuasi-religioso) y no un marine americano en vietnam luchando por la democracy. La historia es sencilla pero funciona para simplemente llevar el juego adelante. La flota enjambre es una oda a la tecnologÃ­a actual y de lo que puede llegar a hacer un buen grupo de programadores.

Juego libre de ""wokismo"" y de ideologÃ­as actuales de cualquier tipo. Fiel a su momento histÃ³rico futuro y su idiosincrasia, algo que por desgracia cuesta ver hoy dÃ­a en las adaptaciones y arruina muchas franquicias.

Jugabilidad comparable e incluso superior a la de un gears of war lo que hace que jugar sea divertido y tenga un feedback positivo mÃ¡s alla del lore o tema.

En definitiva no me podÃ­a creer que no pudiera criticar nada del juego !!
Por fin hay alguien que ha respetado la comunidad y ha hecho lo que le han pedido, ni mÃ¡s ni menos.

Una maravilla. Muy recomendado tanto si conoces el Warhammer como si no y quieres explorarlo a tu ritmo.
Muchas Gracias por hacer un juego tan bueno.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ah, mes petits enfants du Warp, installez-vous bien, car je vais vous faire une Ã©valuation bien juteuse de Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 ! Vous allez voir, c'est une tornade de bagarre, de violence galactique, et de chaos spatial qui va vous dÃ©calquer les neurones comme une hache tronÃ§onneuse dans le crÃ¢ne d'un Ork. Allez, c'est parti, et on commence par les gros morceaux bien croustillants, puis on ira vers les dÃ©tails un peu plusâ€?piquants.

Les points positifs !

Une immersion brute, violente et Ã©pique
Vous entrez dans la peau dâ€™un Space Marine, un vrai, un dur, un Ultramarine avec des pecs de la taille d'un tank et un amour profond pour le carnage mÃ©thodique ! L'atmosphÃ¨re du jeu, c'est du Warhammer 40K pur jus. Vous n'avez mÃªme pas besoin de connaÃ®tre l'univers pour vous laisser emporter par la rage qui suinte de chaque pixel. Les combats sont nerveux, les ennemis volent en morceaux, câ€™est une vÃ©ritable danse de la destruction orchestrÃ©e Ã  la perfection.

Un systÃ¨me de combat jouissif
Mais bon sang de Terre, qu'est-ce que c'est bon de taper ! La mÃªlÃ©e est dâ€™une satisfaction totale, avec des animations qui sentent le poids, la brutalitÃ©, et ce petit Â« sploutch Â» bien gras quand votre marteau tonnerre vient se poser dÃ©licatement sur un Tyranide. Les armes de tir ? Des Å“uvres dâ€™art en mouvement ! Le Bolter claque comme un canon de tank, chaque balle semble avoir un impact titanesque, et on sent bien le poids du matos. Vous Ãªtes lÃ  pour dÃ©cimer, et Ã§a se ressent Ã  chaque coup.

La horde tyranide : un cauchemar vivant !
Ah, les Tyranides, ces crÃ©atures dÃ©gueulasses et innombrables ! Les vagues dâ€™ennemis qui dÃ©ferlent, câ€™est un pur rÃ©gal pour les amateurs de massacre en masse. Et lÃ , mes bons amis, on en prend plein la figure : ils sont rapides, ils sont nombreux, et ils nâ€™ont quâ€™un seul but, vous dÃ©vorer. Ã‡a donne une intensitÃ© incroyable aux combats, car chaque seconde est un dÃ©fi de survie oÃ¹ vous devez littÃ©ralement vous frayer un chemin Ã  coups de Bolter et de tronÃ§onneuse pour ne pas finir en repas de festin.

Graphismes et mise en scÃ¨ne Ã  couper le souffle
On est sur du haut niveau. Les dÃ©cors sont grandioses, colossaux, totalement Ã  lâ€™Ã©chelle de lâ€™univers de Warhammer 40K. Les citÃ©s forteresses, les planÃ¨tes dÃ©vastÃ©es, tout est dÃ©taillÃ©, tout est majestueux, et la mise en scÃ¨ne vous balance directement au cÅ“ur de cette guerre infinie. Le travail sur la lumiÃ¨re et les textures ? Un rÃ©gal visuel pour un jeu de cette envergure.

Un mode coop qui promet de belles heures de franche rigolade
Parce que oui, jouer en solo, câ€™est bien, mais alors fracasser du Xeno avec des potes, câ€™est encore mieux ! Imaginez-vous, trois Space Marines, chacun armÃ© jusqu'aux dents, avec des stratÃ©gies bien primaire du genre Â« On fonce dans le tas et on verra bien aprÃ¨s Â». Câ€™est de la coop Ã  l'ancienne, honnÃªte, comme on l'aime, avec de grosses sessions de dÃ©glingue entre amis.

Les points nÃ©gatifs !

Une rÃ©pÃ©titivitÃ© qui peut poindre Ã  lâ€™horizon
Oui mes pâ€™tits nobles du Warp, Ã  force de massacrer des vagues incessantes de Tyranides, on peut avoir cette petite impression de Â« dÃ©jÃ -vu Â». L'action, aussi intense soit-elle, finit par se rÃ©pÃ©ter au bout dâ€™un certain temps. Ce nâ€™est pas un gros souci si vous Ãªtes un bourrin dans lâ€™Ã¢me comme moi, mais ceux qui cherchent de la variÃ©tÃ© pourraient trouver l'expÃ©rience un brin linÃ©aire sur le long terme.

Pas assez dâ€™ennemis variÃ©s pour lâ€™instant
On adore les Tyranides, hein, câ€™est clair. Mais quâ€™est-ce quâ€™ils sont nombreux. Peut-Ãªtre quâ€™un peu plus de diversitÃ© dans les hordes ennemies aurait Ã©tÃ© le bienvenu. On se retrouve souvent Ã  poutrer les mÃªmes types de crÃ©atures, sans avoir lâ€™occasion de changer de mÃ©thode ou dâ€™approche. Peut-Ãªtre quâ€™avec des DLC ou des mises Ã  jour, on verra plus de saloperies mutantes, mais pour lâ€™instant, câ€™est une armÃ©e de bestioles ressemblantes qui vous dÃ©ferle dessus.

Narration secondaire un peu en retrait
Bon, on ne joue pas Ã  Space Marine 2 pour son intrigue Shakespearienne, on est bien dâ€™accord, mais lâ€™histoire est tout de mÃªme un peu en arriÃ¨re-plan. Elle ne vous accroche pas particuliÃ¨rement, elle sert surtout de prÃ©texte Ã  aller fracasser du Xenos. Si vous aimez les grandes Ã©popÃ©es narratives profondes et chargÃ©es dâ€™Ã©motion, vous resterez un peu sur votre faim.

Lâ€™absence (pour lâ€™instant) dâ€™un multi compÃ©titif
LÃ , on aurait aimÃ© avoir un peu plus de sauce, un mode PvP avec des batailles Ã©piques entre Space Marines, Ã§a aurait Ã©tÃ© un pur rÃ©gal ! Mais Ã  lâ€™heure actuelle, le jeu se concentre surtout sur la coopÃ©ration, ce qui est dÃ©jÃ  Ã©norme. Cependant, on espÃ¨re que les futurs ajouts viendront combler ce petit manque et offrir des batailles Ã©piques contre d'autres joueurs.

Conclusion
Alors, quâ€™est-ce quâ€™on en pense au final de ce Space Marine 2 ?! Eh bien, câ€™est une claque monumentale, une boucherie galactique Ã  laquelle il est impossible de rÃ©sister si vous aimez les combats intenses, lâ€™univers Warhammer 40K et que vous avez toujours rÃªvÃ© de jouer un Ultramarine avec un Bolter dans une main et une tronÃ§onneuse dans lâ€™autre. Oui, il y a des petites imperfections, mais on les pardonne aisÃ©ment face Ã  lâ€™intensitÃ© du fun pur qui vous attend.

En rÃ©sumÃ©, câ€™est de la puissance brute, câ€™est Ã©pique, câ€™est grandiose. Et quand vous plongerez dans le feu de la bataille, rappelez-vous toujours : ""A L'ASSAUUUUUT ! POUR L'EMPEREUUUUR !"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a excellent addition to the Warhammer 40K Gaming Universe. The creative team did a great job at providing a fresh story experience while building on the narrative of the original. You really do learn to appreciate and fight with your squad by the end. I could go on at length, but the Emperors work is best experienced rather than described.

"Saber Interactive saw the Helldivers 2 nerf controversy and must have said to themselves """"Yeah"," let's nerf the fun like Arrowhead Studios did."""" This is a classic Spongebob """"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson"," old man?"""" moment. If you want players to utilize specific weapons"," nerfing the """"more powerful"""" variant will not encourage players to use them", you're just making the weapons they've been using more frustrating to play with, yet they are removing the power aspect from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have played through the original 6 operations on Substantial and Ruthless quite a few times across all classes and never once thought to myself """"Man... this is way too easy"," I wish the developers would do something to make this harder."""" Let's talk about the nerfs specifically:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Translation: Fencing weapons are essentially as hard to achieve a parry as Balanced weapons now. If both types have the same perfect parry window """"duration""""", then there is no reason to choose Fencing over Balanced now. This will not entice players to use Block weapon types, because I could argue that parrying is a requirement on Substantial, Ruthless, and now especially Lethal to avoid taking massive damage and restore armor when you're getting swarmed by enemies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never found Auspex Scan to have a significant damage bonus on Terminus enemies. It was a noticeable effect, but this is just an unnecessary nerf given how much health they have and aren't easy to kill even with Auspex Scan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I assume they mean 'Melta Bomb' because that's what this equipment is called in-game, an item I felt its intended use was specifically for bosses or packed groups of enemies. It did good damage to bosses but it never was an instant kill. A 70% damage reduction to bosses now means there's no real reason to carry a Melta Bomb unless there's nothing else to grab and you're out of grenades. After reading this, I'm convinced Saber Interactive does not even play or test their own game. I'm pressing X for Doubt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is pretty bad news for anyone who enjoys playing as Heavy. Ammunition on Ruthless and even Substantial has already been scarce, and the Heavy is the class that is supposed to be the ranged powerhouse. Without ammo, Heavy is borderline useless since he is the only class that does not have a melee weapon. Majoris enemies on Substantial and above are very numerous and already bullet sponges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The player's armor reduction is just another unnecessary nerf; armor values and damage felt reasonable before this update. Remember when a single hit from a Minoris enemy drained a full armor segment in 1.0? I thought Saber was on the right track after they tweaked that, but it turns out I was wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not opposed to a new difficulty, but it's how they have implemented it that I have a problem with, and there is no reason to attempt this mode other than curiosity and players going for 100%. Completing this across all operations rewards you with a damaged starting helm that you can use across all classes and a Power Sword skin. 2 cosmetics that don't even look good for overcoming such a challenge. The majority of players have yet to complete a Ruthless Operation so far, so I don't know why they'd even implement a Lethal difficulty just a month after the game's release; it seems like a waste of resources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I already covered limited ammo refills, but I want to go over armour restoration: How am I supposed to restore armour as Sniper," Vanguard or Assault? Players naturally become separated from each other during waves/massive waves and mission objectives that . You can't just apply a mandatory tether to players thinking it creates """"teamwork"""". It's just a stupid way of making the game harder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think Chaos Operations are less popular than Tyranids because of how annoying Chaos can be, especially Rubric Marines, an enemy that will consistently and unpredictably teleport over large distances to either evade you or attack you is not the best game design in my opinion. It reminds me of the Knights from Halo 4, an enemy that isn't fun to fight. I never found Chaos Operations to be easier than Tyranids. Even after this patch, you still think Operations mode is a bit too easy? How? I doubt you guys even play your own game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I never disable comments on any of my reviews. That being said, it has lead to some interesting and heated interactions. Like Helldivers 2, I have seen a few super elite gamers sweeping," generalizing and disparaging those of us voicing our opinions on the update """"cry this whine that"""". Which is ironic", because you're crying about people complaining. Understand that you are the minority with that hot take and those of you who sit in forums all day to argue for nerfs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The purpose of this review was to express my discontent with the developers over the direction they are taking Space Marine 2. I believed balance was in an okay spot for Space Marine 2, and Saber should have focused on creating content rather than nerfing.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Despite the fact that the review is positive," for me it's more of a """"yellow"""" type of review (which I hope they will eventually add to Steam", though Iâ€™m starting to doubt it). The game looks expensive and polished, it's a good, not overly long action game set in the Warhammer universe, and the gameplay on a gamepad is really well done. The joystick vibrates and even reacts to walking," giving the character in the Space Marine suit a sense of """"weight.""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, that's where the positives end for me. Here's what really bothered me. First, the combat feels quite repetitive. While smashing enemies is fun in the first few hours, it quickly gets stale and stops being enjoyable. Moreover, I noticed that the difficulty seems a bit broken because on higher difficulty levels, and even then," enemies will still flank you and """"make your life miserable."""" But if you lower the difficulty just one notch", the game becomes too easy and uninteresting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The variety of enemies is small, and they're pretty dull, requiring no special tactics to defeat. The multiplayer PvP mode, by the way, is terrible - I didn't like it at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The special operations that run parallel to the story can be considered a positive aspect, as they let you try out different Space Marine classes and include some progression. However, they don't add much depth to the game, though they do make it a bit better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For fans of the Warhammer universe or those who just want to switch off their brain and enjoy some action and shooting for a couple of evenings, I would recommend it. But it's best not to have high expectations," as they got in the way for me.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over 130k players in game right now and only 600 reviews. With mixed results. Well seems like all the players who are enjoying the game haven't stopped to submit a review yet.
I've seen negative reviews on crashes and performance, also ""cooking our cpu's"". Rest assured these players forgot to remove the ""Please remove"" plastic from their cpu cooler cause with a:
i7 12700k
RTX 3060ti
Max temps with high/medium graphics and DLSS
CPU 68c
GPU 70c (hotspot 81c)

Hardly ""cooking"".. Game runs very smooth, getting 80+ FPS with the above hardware and graphics. No bugs (pun intended) or crashes so far. Gameplay is amazing, visuals are amazing. It's the space marine game you wanted and have gotten.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game is great but needs SERIOUS polishing on the network side of things. I'm one of those unfortunate souls who has been plagued with the inconsistent connection errors since day one. As in, after EVERY mission/op/session of ANY kind I am disconnected from the servers with no way of reconnecting. The only way to ""fix"" it is to ALT+F4 and restart the game. And you can't make progress offline (at least with ops) as it isn't saved. Would it be such a big deal to fix that if I wanted to solo some ops? I've had multiple runs where I would make it to the end of a mission and disconnect RIGHT before getting out. VERY disappointing. I've tried the PVP side of things as well and I can barely get through a match without getting a network error, and all my progress is lost. So what's the point?

So that being said the game is GOOD enough to make me want to slog through this madness, but I'd wait until a patch releases that addresses these issues first before throwing down on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40000: Space Marines II Is a fantastic game.
The characters in Warhammer 40000: Space Marines II are not just part of the story; they are the story. Each one is uniquely developed, with its own distinct personality that adds depth and complexity to the narrative.
The main character, Titus, what can I say? He is just a chad; no other word can describe him. He rises to the challenge no matter what, with his unwavering faith in the Imperium of man and the Emperor.
The story was fantastic, well done, and filled with epic moments that make you goosebumps.

Giving this game a 9/10

Courage and Honour!!

FOR THE EMPEROR!!!!!

Rip The Bugs, Tear The Heretics
Iâ€™m sure each of us has at least one franchise out there where youâ€™re consistently reminded of its existence, but continuously avoid it through the years for one reason or another. I canâ€™t tell you exactly what kept me from getting into Warhammer, but my awareness of its quantity-over-quality approach to video games was probably the main demotivator. But even I stood up when they announced a sequel to Space Marine, widely regarded as one of the best games in the franchise. After getting the opportunity to review this sequel, I went to play the original for the first time, and loved its aggressive ranged and melee combat alongside a basic but interesting story which ended on a surprisingly dark note for lead character Titus. Despite being made by a different developer, Space Marine 2 feels like the natural evolution of that experience, boasting deeper combat, top-tier presentation, and a solid selection of modes, though its lean amount of content currently makes it a â€˜greater than the sum of its partsâ€?type of situation.

Letâ€™s start with the gameâ€™s unifying elements, namely the combat and visuals. Space Marine 2â€™s combat is unique in the sense that melee is as valuable and persistent as a tool for dispatching threats as your guns, where left-clicking fires the latter, and right-clicking switches you to the former instantaneously. This will be necessary when you start dealing with large enemy swarms, as your melee weapon can be a reliable tool for parrying anything that dares to get too close, and your gun is the fastest way of earning back contested health and hence keep you in the fight for longer. Dealing enough damage will open enemies up for executions to restore both health and armour, and timing this correctly is the difference between a marine thatâ€™s down and out, or one thatâ€™s alive and angry. This creates a visceral combat loop where aggression is necessary for survival, and the right tool for the job is always available. Backed up by solid weapon variety and meaty gun sounds across the board, the combat is the power fantasy of a Space Marine fully realised.

Visually, this is undoubtedly one of the best-looking games on the market. Character and enemy models are highly detailed, insinuating the war history of your brothers and the deadliness of your foes, environments feel larger than life, and the technology used to deliver these massive enemy swarms is incredibly impressive. Looking out into the battlefield and seeing hundreds of enemies consistently left me in awe; games have rarely been able to capture that sense of scale, yet Space Marine 2 rose to this challenge and triumphed.

Space Marine 2 offers three distinct modes, being the Campaign, PvE, and PvP. The Campaign continues the story of Demetrian Titus, an Ultramarine accused of heresy, brought back into the fray after years of service to the Deathwatch to assist in fighting a Tyranid invasion and the forces of Chaos. While it is simple and competent enough to stand on its own, the narrative works best if youâ€™ve experienced the original. There are plot elements and conversations that carry substantial weight if you know Titusâ€?history, while the plot developments outside of this, especially the ending, were largely underwhelming.

The structure and progression of the campaign has me feeling mixed overall. Each mission is surprisingly long, taking you through multiple different locations and large combat sequences, really immersing you in these high-stakes operations. This helps as the campaign is oppressively linear and not very replayable, with no substantial side paths, identical enemy spawn patterns, and zero character progression, ultimately making it feel a bit repetitive by the midway point. Indeed, the PvE mode is arguably the strongest element of the package because of its character-building possibilities, and where the combat really started to click for me. Youâ€™ll select one of six classes to tackle shorter but still diverse missions which take place adjacent to the main campaign, gaining exp and currency to improve your abilities and weapons to ultimately tackle the highest difficulties. Every class feels distinct yet equally powerful, helped by active abilities which double down on their specialities. The Bulwark gets a banner that can regenerate armour, the Tactical has a marking tool which temporarily provides a major damage boost to the target, and my personal favourite, the Assault, has a permanent jump pack that opens up considerable offensive and defensive options. However, there are only six missions, and no amount of changing up enemy placements is going to make moving through these same environments any less repetitive.

My sole criticism for the PvP is nearly identical, as there are currently only three modes and maps, an incredibly low number that gives the impression it was tacked on like the good old early 2010s days. Which is a shame, as this combat model built for large hordes is seamlessly converted into one that is equally satisfying when staring down the barrel of other Space Marines. All of the practice you gained in PvE with each class ability can be put to great use in either the deathmatch or objective modes, though this different context allows some of them to take on new uses, such as allowing the Vanguard or Sniper to flank behind the enemy with their grapple hook and cloak abilities respectively.

While Space Marine 2 is undoubtedly a next-gen title, I did not experience the consistent 60fps that was promised by the recommended requirements. This game is quite CPU demanding due to the enemy density, though despite upgrading my CPU mid-review period to one that should clear the recommended requirements, hectic combat sequences would still consistently drop below 60fps, even on medium settings. These drops were worse and more consistent before the upgrade (from a Ryzen 7 3700X to a Ryzen 9 5900X if youâ€™re curious), though PvP and less dense arenas have few issues maintaining stability. If you possess a very high-end build, you will probably run this game fine, but anything less and you should be prepared to tolerate a consistently sub-par frame rate in some areas.

Outside of performance issues, the game is very polished. I experienced a single crash and no major bugs, though the squad AI could use some adjustments as their pathing is occasionally very illogical, sometimes failing to revive a teammate even when theyâ€™re only 10 metres away, for instance. Matchmaking was also inconsistent, particularly with PvP where there were long periods when I was unable to get into any match. PvE matchmaking has been largely solid, although the omission of Day 1 private lobbies is a very disappointing decision. This frustration was compounded after I consistently got put into groups where the host was playing my class, forcing me to back out due to the one-per-class limit. Filtering options and general online stability improvements are needed.

Space Marine 2 is a visually stunning third-person combat masterclass, which shines brightest if you delve deeply into every mode. In isolation, its linear campaign and content-deficient online modes would bring down a less complete game, but the fact that all of these elements are present under one banner means it currently offers a great package which will almost certainly become exceptional with time. Iâ€™ll definitely be revisiting it at every major update for a long while to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now this is an actual fun game!

The story is awesome, its short (around 10h) but not every game needs to be 100+h just looking for 100 collectibles or walking aimlessly through an empty open world that alot of games have had recently.

Combat is fluent and clean, feels like a mix of gears of war and a bit of soulslike with the parrying and dodging. It's not clunky at all like some people say it is.

Most weapons feels good to use and combat finishers is a dopamine rush when they occur especially on bosses.

Operations (PvE mode) while being few at launch is just pure fun to play and all the classes has their own specialty so it makes it fun to try them all and max their level to max.

I haven't tried the PvP yet so i can't speak on that.

Not a single microtransaction or ingame store, you just have to play to earn cosmetics like the good old days. (there are dlc for more but im fine with that.)

This game really feels like a Xbox 360 game, in a good way, when it was meant to just have fun with the game and not have a store screaming at you when you start the game.

Hands down this is the most fun i've had in a game in years.

The game is just pure fun no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game worked on Linux from launch up to the latest patch, which has made online play impossible. They have since changed Linux to unsupported on the product page and have emailed via their support tickets a mix of messages that the game will not be supported on linux and/or that they're aware of and attempting to fix the issue; so not even their support staff are aware of what's going on in any cohesive capacity.

The devs themselves have said full steam deck (inherent linux support) is coming by end of year on their website, and to reiterate, it worked fine and dandy at launch on linux machines.

I as well as most others who purchased the game with intent to play on Linux have likely exceeded the 2 hour playtime at this point and are denied refund requests despite the game no longer being playable, so no refunds and no concrete official statements of any kind from the developer as of this review's posting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attention mesdames et messieurs, il s'agit d'un jeu COMPLET !
HÃ© oui vous ne rÃªvez pas, c'est arrivÃ©. TerminÃ© la campagne, fais toutes les ops en multi et tout Ã§a sans un seul bug, sans un crash ou glitch en tout genre, dÃ©jÃ  gros positif pour Ã§a. Et dire que c'Ã©tait la norme avant ... aujourd'hui c'est rÃ©volu mais Saber l'a fait donc on peut les en remercier (je vais essayer de donner le max de dÃ©tails sans m'attarder ci-dessous mais pas Ã©vident car il propose beaucoup pour un jeu dÃ¨s sa sortie)

Dans son ensemble, le jeu est assez dingue :
- graphisme : Ã§a claque, rien Ã  dire. Petit +, je vous invite Ã  faire joujou avec le module ""photo"" dans le menu une fois en game, je vous promets une belle surprise. C'est simple j'ai un nouveau wallpaper 4K :)
- gameplay : on sent la puissance du/des personnages incarnÃ©s et des armes utilisÃ©es. Peu paraitre assez lent sur certaines actions (notamment corps Ã  corps) pour quelques uns mais Ã§a respecte assez bien le fait qu'on joue un soldat en hyper blindage faut pas l'oublier quand mÃªme ... et bien que lente, une attaque chargÃ©e de marteau ne vous dÃ©cevra jamais, plaisir garantit. Et je ne vous parle pas des contres et finishers, mama!
- campagne : riche et variÃ©e, histoire travaillÃ©e et scÃ©nario qui en vaut la peine, certaines scÃ¨nes sont assez Ã©piques, immersives et vous prendront aux tripes. (exemple: quand on vous dira invasion, Ã§a ne sera pas 3 petits et 1 moyen qui vous sauteront dessus ou dans le paysage mais bien une nuÃ©e en route pour vous dÃ©molir). +- 10h de jeu sans tryhard.
- autres actis : le PVP j'ai pas test mais pas trop mon truc de base donc on verra. Les ops en coop sont variÃ©es Ã©galement, il y en a 8 pour l'instant et elles vous promettent un trÃ¨s beau challenge. Il y a 4 (5?) niveaux de difficultÃ©s et dÃ©jÃ  le 2 c'est vraiment pas de la tarte ... donc de belles heures de gameplay en perspective.
- progression : point Ã  lui tout seul tellement ce dernier a Ã©tÃ© dÃ©veloppÃ©. Je vous invite Ã  aller voir des vidÃ©os lÃ  dessus sur youtube si vous voulez plus de dÃ©tails car c'est dÃ©jÃ  bien poussÃ© (darktide c'est du flan Ã  cÃ´tÃ©) mais en gros, il y a pour l'instant 6 classes jouables, chacune ayant sa compÃ©tence active (1 par classe, un ""ulti"") et des passives bien distinctes, qui sont Ã  monter avec de l'expÃ©rience acquise en combat. A cÃ´tÃ© de Ã§a, il y a l'Ã©quipement (certains Ã©tant spÃ©cifiques par classe, je pense par exemple au bolter lourd rÃ©servÃ© pour la classe lourde uniquement .. oui oui je sais j'ai fait la mÃªme tÃªte) avec sa courbe de progression pour chaque arme. Bonus passif, versions amÃ©liorÃ©es, .. you name it ! + non nÃ©gligeable, il est possible qu'une mÃªme arme soit utilisÃ©e par plusieurs classes, sa progression est partagÃ©e Ã  travers toutes ces derniÃ¨res. Vous ne devez donc pas la remonter de 0 en changeant de classes, malin !
- personnalisation : last but not least comme disent les anglais! Gros catalogue de personnalisation couleur avec toutes les piÃ¨ces de votre armure modifiables individuellement. Et tout Ã§a ? Juste avec de la monnaie in game, pas possible avec de l'argent rÃ©el. Un plaisir.

Donc:
Grand OUI pour le jeu, foncez et partagez la dÃ©mocratie de l'Empereur ;) . Seul petit nÃ©gatif potentiel, les missions pourraient devenir rÃ©pÃ©titives Ã  la longue pour atteindre les niveaux les plus hauts, Ã  voir ... moi pour l'instant je ne le ressens pas.

Bonus:
Quelle version choisir ?
J'ai pris l'ultra Ã©dition mais je ne pense pas que le cosmÃ©tique offert en vaille vraiment la peine.. par contre le season pass aucune idÃ©e de comment cela va se dÃ©rouler donc Ã  vous de voir ... mais si le contenu futur est dans la lignÃ©e de ce qui est dÃ©jÃ  proposÃ©, Ã§a ne sera pas une perte.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really wanted to love this game but i just cannot recommend it. it crashes every time i get to the opening cutscene and no matter what i try i cannot solve this issue. I waited for the first hotpatch to arrive and i also made sure that my drivers were up to date and i verified the integrity of the game files. still nothing. if i can ill probably refund this...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game is fun. But it's not $70 fun. The campaign is a 1 and done. There is no unlocks, there is no new game +, no experience or anything. Operations are a treat but there's only 6 of them and to unlock every piece of gear on a single class, you need to successfully complete like 30 missions. For a single class. And there are 6. You will be seeing the same environments and the same encounters a LOT if you want them all. Or you can play PvP. While PvP is balanced, there are 3 game modes and 3 maps. That's it. You will be seeing the same enviornments and the same encounters a -LOT-. As it stands, at launch, this game is not worth $70. Wait for a sale or for DLC to come out. Do not buy at full price during the launch week.

edit: a lot of y'all are thinking this review means I think it's a bad game. I don't. Steam's review is only recommend or don't recommend. As the game is right now, at full price, I do not recommend the game. I am fully aware there is more content down the line, but that doesn't take away from how the game launched. If I thought this was a bad game, I would've said it's a bad game. I think it's a good game that's overpriced and lacking in content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Un juego imprescindible para los fans de la franquicia y los amantes del shooter en 3ra persona!
HacÃ­a rato que no disfrutaba una campaÃ±a de un juego tan bien lograda, la historia es emocionante, la jugabilidad es adictiva, combates intensos, el sistema de bloqueos con remates me vuela de gusto, grÃ¡ficos y sonidos impresionantes, van al compÃ¡s del universo Warhammer.

La campaÃ±a son 6 misiones, pero quiero remarcar que son largas las misiones, lei gente quejÃ¡ndose que es muy corta y estÃ¡n errados!

Operaciones (Pve), es el modo mÃ¡s popular del juego, aquÃ­ de momento tenemos para seleccionar 6 tipos de clases, se podra ir progresando los personajes en skill, armamentos, cosmÃ©ticos, pinturas etc; los retos y la jugabilidad estÃ¡n garantizados, existen 6 diferentes misiones y duran aproximadamente 30min a mas si se extienden por dificultades, ademÃ¡s existen 4 modos de dificultades (el reto seria ganar en la Ãºltima â€œDespiadadaâ€? un abuso de golpes imagino)
Si se darÃ¡n cuenta, este juego tiene una similitud en cuanto a la selecciÃ³n de modos, progreso, la base al â€œAliens Fireteam Eliteâ€?y si son los mismos editores.

Modo Guerra Eterna (PvP), Existen 3, conquista, capturas y aniquilaciÃ³n de momento; No esta mal pero esto no es un juego para competitivo, esta para pasar un buen rato con team de amigos y no mas; permite equipos de hasta 6 x bandos, probÃ© los modos y no me generan esa adrenalina como en otros shooters en 3ra, â€œes obvio acÃ¡ te moves como tortuga jaâ€?
Lo voy a poner en mayÃºsculas: â€œESTA EXCELENTEMENTE OPTIMIZADOâ€? da placer que de entrada salga hoy dia un juego asi.
Otro acierto es el multiplataforma cruzadas, eso permite que siempre encuentres gente en los diferentes modos co op y alarga la vida de un juego.

Negativo en grande â€œsu DLCâ€?es increÃ­ble cÃ³mo se les fue la mano larga, pague por el juego 35 dol y te venden un DLC de pase de temporada a 25 Dol. que solo trae colores o estÃ©ticas minÃºsculas, soy de comprar pases de temporadas en otros juegos, pero esto de aquÃ­ es un arriba las manos y una porquerÃ­a, ojala mejoren en ese aspecto.

Por ultimo agrego que esta su hoja de ruta y anuncian mas actualizaciones incluidos el aÃ±o prÃ³ximo (2025), con mÃ¡s modos, mapas etc
JUEGAZO, claro candidato a Game of the year Steam 2024!=)",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction
Space Marine 2 is the direct sequel to the prominently acclaimed game of 2011. With improvements to nearly every aspect of the original, this highly anticipated sequel seeks to push the threshold of third-person shooters with high-octane action sequences balanced with an intensive story set in the annals of Warhammer.












One century after the events of Space Marine, Demetrian Titus returns to active service with his chapter, The Ultramarines. Having spent the last hundred years serving in the Deathwatch as a Black Shield, his return is met with suspicion and hostility, but the growing threat of the Tyranids must take priority. With bolter in hand and his brothers at his side, nothing shall stand in the way as a story of deception, intrigue, and loyalty unfolds before the falsely disgraced former Captain.



A truly well-thought-out and designed storyline unravels at a relaxed pace as you traverse the enormous levels brimming with plot and entices you to take one more step until hours have passed without your notice. It is a genuinely intriguing story set in an enormous world that makes me want to learn more and delve deeper into the franchise.

Space Marine 2, at its core, is a third-person action shooter, so naturally the essence of the game is gunplay and movement.

The gunplay has been expertly thought-out to deliver clean, streamlined accessibility to loads of different guns and the ability to use them intuitively on the go. The arsenal available is substantial and provides plenty of unique gameplay mechanics that can vastly change between each type, and understanding their strengths and weaknesses is essential for progression, but there are so many choices and moments where you get to make them that you won't likely be stuck with a mistake for long.

The movement has also taken a massive quality of life improvement from the original, and while the Space Marines feel realistically heavy, they carry their weight well and can throw it around quite effortlessly and effectively. This makes movement a way to traverse the battlefield but also a weapon on its own. My only issue is that there is no way to take cover or crouch behind what cover is available, which often means you will get incapacitated quickly on the more challenging difficulties.

In addition to the lengthy campaign, you have a couple of other game modes to participate in, which vastly extend the playability.

Operations mode is secondary objective missions that parallel the primary campaign and allow you to choose classes to undertake them. These reward you with customisations and experience points varying for the difficulty you choose.



Eternal War is the player vs player mode in this game where you again get to choose the class you want to play, but you pit your skills against other players in the world for the glory of the Emperor.

Space Marine 2 is highly cooperative in its design, allowing players to pretty much do all of the activities in the game with other players. I played most of it solo, but I genuinely enjoyed the cooperative experience because it allowed me to do it at my leisure.

Because there is such an expansive amount of content to play through there is a literal plethora of unlockable customisations in the game for you to unlock and discover through exploration.

Every class has a perk tree that requires mission completions and matches to be completed to gain levels to attain them and each weapon has its own mastery and perk tree as well. This vastly increases capability allowing you to tackle harder missions and in turn, earn even better rewards.

I was genuinely impressed by the sheer volume of unlockables available, from specialty armour types and chapter paints to decals and accessories to help make the Space Marine your own.

Space Marine 2 is hands-down one of the most aesthetically pleasing games I've ever experienced. The minor and major details in this game left me awe-stricken many times over and the general visual ambience and environments just captivate both heart and imagination. With a fairly inclusive photo mode available as well, you could spend hours just playing with that feature alone.



The audio is also of sensational quality. A clear effort has been made to create immersive audio for animations, and environments as well as the sound of how visceral the game can be when you're hacking into the enemies or prying away flesh from bone. Truly one of the most gratifying experiences in gaming.

ğŸŸ§ The game isn't without its flaws however, it is a hungry powerhouse for resources and running it at Ultra, I was able to hit a consistent 60 FPS at 2560 x 1440 but that's with significant dips from my FPS cap of 90.
ğŸŸ¨ I also had some severe crashing on day one, but that passed relatively quickly and the game hasn't crashed since.
RAM: 32GB 3200GHz G-Skill (DDR4)

I am far from a veteran fan of Warhammer, but having played both of the Space Marine games now I am invested in the universe and want to expand my knowledge of the world, and I think that is where this game truly shines. Not only is it a grandiose and beautiful experience in an enormous universe of story and intrigue, but it's a great entry point for beginners and while I recommend you play 1 first because they are directly connected, I don't think it necessary and can be played as an entirely individual experience. Highly recommend this game even at full price. A truly spectacular game that deserves all the high praise it's receiving and then some.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Si vous Ãªtes un fan absolu de Warhammer 40,000, passer Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de Space Marine 2 serait pure hÃ©rÃ©sie.
Avec Space Marine 2, je me suis senti rajeunir, Pas de blabla inutile, juste de lâ€™action pure et dure, sans artifice, mais avec un sens de la mise en scÃ¨ne, de lâ€™esthÃ©tique et du spectaculaire maÃ®trisÃ©, tout comme ces parties de plateau qui duraient toute la nuit ^^





- Le mode campagne est excellent et permet de sâ€™habituer aux commandes (pour les fans de la licence et du 1er du nom câ€™est encore meilleur).
- Le mode PvE propose un vrai challenge plus difficile et surtout on sâ€™amuse avec nos partenaires de jeux !
- Le PvP est pour le moment trÃ¨s bon aussi et Ã©quilibrÃ© mais Ã  voir dans le futur.





Le respect de lâ€™univers Warhammer 40.000, techniquement et visuellement irrÃ©prochable, un systÃ¨me de combat brutal, un vÃ©ritable respect Ã  tout ce que construit Games Workshop depuis des annÃ©es, dâ€™abord grÃ¢ce Ã  sa rÃ©alisation Ã©pique et lÃ©chÃ©e, chaque dÃ©cor traversÃ© subjugue par son respect envers la licence.

ce jeu permet a tous ceux qui n'ont pas connu cette fabuleuse expÃ©rience de jeu de plateau, montage et peinture de figurines (et tout ces ""codex"") de dÃ©couvrir un formidable et monstrueux univers futuriste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DÃ¨s les premiÃ¨res minutes, le jeu capture lâ€™essence brutale et Ã©pique de lâ€™univers Warhammer 40k. Les graphismes sont Ã  couper le souffle, chaque dÃ©tail des armures des Space Marines et des hordes xenos est rendu avec une prÃ©cision impressionnante. Les combats sont intenses, mÃªlant habilement tir et corps Ã  corps, et chaque affrontement contre les Tyranides est une danse mortelle oÃ¹ la moindre erreur peut Ãªtre fatale.

Lâ€™histoire est riche et immersive, respectant fidÃ¨lement le lore Ã©tabli tout en introduisant de nouveaux Ã©lÃ©ments captivants. Les dialogues et les interactions avec les autres personnages renforcent lâ€™immersion, nous rappelant constamment les sacrifices et le devoir des Space Marines envers lâ€™Imperium de lâ€™HumanitÃ©.

Mais ce qui distingue vraiment Space Marine 2, câ€™est son atmosphÃ¨re. On ressent vÃ©ritablement la pression et lâ€™urgence de chaque mission, la camaraderie entre frÃ¨res dâ€™armes, et la dÃ©termination inÃ©branlable de Titus face Ã  lâ€™adversitÃ©. La bande-son, Ã©pique et martiale, accompagne parfaitement chaque moment de gloire et de dÃ©sespoir.

En conclusion, Space Marine 2 nâ€™est pas seulement un jeu, câ€™est une expÃ©rience. Une plongÃ©e dans un univers sombre et fascinant oÃ¹ chaque victoire est arrachÃ©e au prix du sang et du courage. Pour lâ€™Empereur et lâ€™Imperium, je recommande ce jeu Ã  tous les fans de Warhammer 40k et Ã  ceux qui cherchent une aventure inoubliable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 3 Minute Review of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. An incredibly satisfying and highly detailed sequel. Support the channel, become a member!


Written Review
Space Marine 2 is a highly-polished and satisfying sequel to the original 2011 game.

This is one the coolest looking 40K games I've played. It truly immerses you in its grimdark world with its stunning environments, attention to lore, meaty audio and intriguing narrative.

The game comes with three modes, the first being the campaign, which is playable solo, or in a 3 person squad with friends. It follows Titus, the protagonist from the first game, as he embarks on missions to take out a new Tyrannid threat.

Each of these missions have you fight through a variety of level layouts with their own unique aesthetic. As you progress the campaign and explore slightly off the beaten path, you'll gain access to a decently-sized arsenal of weapons that come with unique movesets and playstyles.

Space Marine 2 trains you to continuously juggle between ranged and melee combat, as different enemies will have different weaknesses that you need to take advantage of. Ammunition is more scarce than you might expect, and you won't be able to take out an entire horde purely with your guns.

There are many bigger enemies that fight you up-close, and parrying their attacks, and breaking through their defences with your melee weapon can prove to be your most effective means of taking them down.

Melee combat feels great, and comes with a good number of combos and freedom. It also has a very important role in keeping you alive, as executing low-health enemies grants you some armor and regenerates recently-damaged health.

This dance throughout combat was incredibly satisfying to me, and as you get better at it, you really feel empowered. Despite this, it felt like I could die in any fight. I was often barely hanging by a thread by the end of combat, at least on the game's recommended Veteran difficulty. Missions are long and arduous, but in a good way, and due to this continuous struggle, success was very fulfilling.

The second game mode is called ""Operations"", and is also a 1-3 player PvE mode. It includes unique missions separate from the campaign, where you can play as distinct classes with their own unique abilities. The cool part here, is that there is some meta progression. As you play, you can upgrade your weapons, put points into your skill trees, and unlock new cosmetics.

The third game mode is called Eternal War, and is your relatively run-of-the-mill PvP mode, with expected game modes like deathmatch and capture points. You play with the same class types mentioned in Operations. It can be quite fun, but in my opinion, is not the main attraction of the game.

Overall, I think Space Marine 2 feels wonderful to play, and is an absolute blast with friends. The attention to detail, and weight in everything you do really makes it a joy to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game is good, fix the bug for loading into missions, idk how this wasn't a day one patch.

The ship leaves then you are placed back on your battle barge. You then have to stand in a specific spot to trigger loading into the operation.

edit: The 3.0 patch i hoped would fix it. nope. Just made it worse now that the screen remains black after bug happens.

Insane this hasn't been fixed yet..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much like with Star Wars, when a good Warhammer game comes along, you have to hold onto it with both hands.

Space Marine 2 is not an Oscar-winning performance. The dialog in the campaign mode won't have you pondering the (super)human condition and the plot contrivances aren't all that original. The premise of the campaign is even a mirror to the original game's hook, which you could see as good or bad.

But the thing about Titus' story is that you can see the struggle he's dealing with if you know where to look. Sadly that probably won't happen if this is your first 40k game, but it IS a sequel, after all. A player with background knowledge of who Titus is as a man, and who he has to be as a space marine, can see the deep emotional turmoil he finds himself in, a man out of place after the events of the first SM game. The engaging and visceral combat, which is not keeping any secrets about itself, will have you fully believing that every big fight is for all the marbles. I particularly found myself trying as hard as I could to protect NPC imperial guardsmen wherever I found them from the hordes of Tyranids trying to reduce them to biofuel.

They also let you Paint Your Dudes. This is vitally important.

Space Marine 2 is probably the single greatest realization of what the world of Warhammer 40,000 would not only look, but move and sound like. It's had some great competition in recent years like Darktide and Boltgun, but I think this is the new pinnacle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can disconnect even while in ""OFFLINE MODE"" and lose all progress.

Servers are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?toasted. It's less of a game and more of a still-art slideshow of 40k pictures.

audio cuts out, animations freeze, take damage from invisible monsters.

my internet connection is pristine, I am used to having around 9 ping in normal multiplayer lobbies and this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ plays with a 6 second delay. it is miserable.

There are so many people with this problem in youtube comments and reddit posts, but it's not addressed or acknowledged anywhere on Focus Entertainments website for SM2.

I would refund if i had not spent 8 hours TRYING TO CONNECT

This is my first Warhammer game i played and, i understand the appeal it has.
So far i played a few hours on campaign and, a few on online. There are no bugs i found for the momment or any problems so far. Witch is refreshing to see with triple AAA game.
I can see myself investing a lot of time in this game, witch is money well spend for me.
I would give this game a 9/10, and would recomend this game if, you like brutal hack and slash and having a lot of brothers.
So with that being said.

Das Spiel ist der absolute Hammer.
Was ich persÃ¶nlich absolut faszinierend finde ist, dass der Krieg in der Geschichte die erzÃ¤hlt wird, wirklich zu spÃ¼ren ist. Es gibt eine Starthalle, von dort aus kann man den Multiplayer starten oder die RÃ¼stung anpassen. Im Verlauf der Kampagne, passiert in dieser Starthalle immer was anderes, ich habe jetzt 3 oder 4 Kapitel gespielt. Einmal sagte ich mir, nach diesem Kapitel ist Schluss. Dann war ich wieder in der Starthalle und diese AtmosphÃ¤re und dieser Eindruck man ist wirklich im Krieg, haben mich direkt ins nÃ¤chste Kapitel gezogen. Ich konnte nicht anders.

Es ist wirklich beeindruckend, wie hier der Krieg simuliert und dargestellt wird.
Das ist wirklich sehr fesselnd, wie die Starthalle immer mehr nach fortschreiten der Kampagne beeinflusst wird. Es macht mir wirklich groÃŸen SpaÃŸ und ich kann dieses Spiel auch fÃ¼r seinen Vollpreis von 59,99â‚?sehr empfehlen!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I absolutely love this game... but man is it extremely frustrating to play an operation for close to 45 mins and it crash on the last stretch. Was playing the newly released operation for the first time and it crashed the second I got to the Hierophant. I have a very powerful computer so this should not be such a problem. Please fix your game. I cannot bring myself to try again, people's lives are too busy to be gambling 45 mins away every time they boot up your game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a Warhammer fan, the art, the design, just everything pleasing to the eye

As a GAME, this game is overhyped and overpriced. Outdated gameplay that didn't innovate in any sense of the word. I'm disappointed that this was literally just sm1 with better graphics. The content is extremely lacking, 6 repetitive missions with repetitive gameplay to boot. It's better to buy on sale for those who don't wanna read everything.

- Story:
It's brief, generic, and forgettable. The plot is more generic slop comparable to a call of duty campaign so don't expect too much there. The story is effectively glaze central for the BLUEBERRIES then omg secret bad guy plot out of nowhere instead of Tyranids being the main focus, diverting from the more interesting developments that could've been. Wish there was more focus with the marines themselves instead of lol chaos again.

- Lack of various QoL options like FOV sliders.
Not enough graphics options to disable features like post processing effects or light sensitive features, Lack of support of various monitors, Motion blur literally doesn't go off when you set it to off, the list goes on. The game can be a disco show at times, giving me headache on top of only being able to see my character's GIANT ASS cheeks lawd haf murthy.

- Clunky movement and unresponsive actions at times
Dodge is horribly delayed, not many ways to cancel out of animations.
There's these weird moments where you stand still thinking you'd dodge and you may say to yourself ""what i dodged what the heck"" well I'm here to tell you you're not CRAZY. The dodge is hard coded to buffer sprint as an action on PC, resulting into delay actions because of the buffer option select between dodge and sprinting. Extremely ass cheeks.

- Clunky Melee and Ranged Combat.
Aimming feels stiff due to the options for sens being so limited. But for the most part the clunkiness comes from how underpowered the weapons are. There's about 4 usable guns i can think of in my head. The sound design is lacking for some weapons and don't pack the resounding WALLOP that Bolter has in other games. Then the crosshair bloom just makes weapons feels so off and boorish that's not even worth shooting half the time cause you can't hit the board side of a barn. Melee which I was hoping to be different enough to entice ultimately falls short dude to the lack animation cancels for dodge and more. You end up parrying everything as much as possible for it is the only way to cancel, downside being you're standing still to get peppered by bullets. I hope it changes.

- Overly reliant on ""QTEs"" or executions or deadshots
Now that know this may not seem like an issue at first but when you realize these are the only ways to regen armor during combat it becomes glaring. It's cool to see the first 20 times but after 3 hours you'll wish there were introduce more ways to engage with regen. Standing still doing a cool animation with a camera interrupts the flow of gameplay and adds to the clunkiness of the game. The lack of ways to regain armor is astounding. THEY REALLY want you to abuse executions and deadshots as much as possible cause of the iframes executions give you. I wish the game would encourage aggressively slashing my enemies instead of having to watch an animation play for 500th time.

- Overly reliant on off screen indicators
This is the same problem i had with god of war 2018 where the fov was so low that had to see my characters HUGE ASS BACK. Constantly taking backshots from tyranids because i have to look at the funny circle around my character and press the button. It's lazy to me and makes combat feel unfocused.

- Difficulties are badly designed
One sentence, increasing health and damage and nothing is bad difficult design.
Bullet Sponges put people to sleep stop this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Really throws the balance out of whack.

- Content is lacking and the game is highly repetitive
I can't be bothered to play the same 6 missions over and over again that hardly vary enough to be noticable. There's not much to say because of the game not having content on release. The only way they tend to vary is ""place X amount of bombs"" objectives change the number of bomb. Again how is this game 60 bucks?

I really wanted to like this game but it's just an outdated action game to me.

I'm sleepy as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when i made this review so i may have missed some points i wanted to make. But don't buy right now wait for sale.

EDIT 17/10/24: Yeah I'm done with this game.
This roadmap is actually horrible.
1 New mission when we only have 6 in the game is baffling. 1 new weapon is cool i guess.

But the biggest kicker of the whole thing is the obvious malice against modding. They essentially killed modding this update. The only thing keeping the game on life support for me. I enjoyed cosplaying the deathwatch, using various weapons with different classes in pve, AND FINALLY HAVING FOV IN THE GAME, it was a good time. Instead of saber embracing this part of the community, they've effectively killed it off for good this time. Don't let the shills tell you this game is a good faith game. It's not. It's more marine slop core. I'm sure the designers and most devs were very passionate about making the game, but some of the higher ups definitely didn't understand the game's fanbase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Einleitung

Captain Titus, als Strafe zur ""Todeswache"" versetzt kehrt zurÃ¼ck in den regulÃ¤ren Dienst. Du schlÃ¼pfst in die Rolle von Leutnant Titus, das Imperium braucht dich, die Tyrannieden und ein noch viel mÃ¤chtigerer Feind bedrohen die Menschheit. Du kÃ¤mpfst dich durch wahre Gegnerhorden und musst dich auch noch fÃ¼r deine Vergangenheit rechtfertigen.

Gameplay

Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 teilt sich in drei Bereiche auf. Als treuer Soldat des Imperiums stellst du dich natÃ¼rlich zuerst der leider viel zu kurzen Story. In einzelnen Missionen kannst du deine Klasse und AusrÃ¼stung verbessern. Der klassische PVP-Modus wirft dich dann in den Kampf um den Titel des tÃ¶dlichsten Space Marine.

Zur Story an sich mÃ¶chte ich nichts weiter verraten. Zwei Dinge mÃ¶chte ich aber auf jeden Fall schreiben. Die Geschichte wird in actionreichen Szenen und in deutscher Sprache erzÃ¤hlt. Leider leider ist sie aber viel zu schnell zu Ende erzÃ¤hlt. Generell hinterlassen Grafik und Sound dabei und im Spiel allgemein einen sehr guten Eindruck.

Im Story-Modus kÃ¤mpft man in einem drei Mann Trupp gegen wahre Gegner Horden. Die NPC Marines machen dabei einen guten Job, sie kennen den Weg, man kann sich allerdings auch nicht wirklich verlaufen, und fÃ¼hren die ein oder andere Wiederbelebung durch wenn Titus zu schnell in eine Gruppe Gegner gesprungen ist. Die NPC Marines kÃ¶nnen aber auch durch echte Spieler ersetzte oder konfiguriert werden. Zwar kÃ¶nnen vor jeder Mission die Waffen angepasst werden, jedoch liegen zwischen den ganzen Leichenbergen genÃ¼gend Waffen und Munition herum. Hier und da ist ein Wechsel ratsam, das merkt man dann aber schon.

ZusÃ¤tzlich zum Story-Modus kÃ¶nnen noch einzelne Missionen gespielt werden. Hier kÃ¶nnt ihr aus verschiedenen Klassen wÃ¤hlen und diese dann mit passenden Waffen ausstatten. Hier sind allerdings keine NPCs vorgesehen, ihr braucht menschliche Kameraden fÃ¼r den Kampf. Startet ihr allein eine Mission, weist das Spiel euch menschliche Teammitglieder zu und das Schlachten kann beginnen.

Der PVP-Modus ist genau das wonach es erklingt. Als wahrer Soldat des Imperators kÃ¤mpfe ich jedoch nicht gegen die eigenen Kameraden!


Leider muss ich hier ein sehr dunkles Kapitel aufschlagen. Zeitweise war ich so weit ein negatives Review zu schreiben und Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 nicht zu empfehlen. Wer bis hier her gelesen hat, weiÃŸ, dass mir die Story sehr wichtig ist, blÃ¶d nur, dass Spiel in so gut wie jeder Sequenz abgestÃ¼rzt ist. Es galt also das Spiel neu zu starten und wieder bis zu dieser Stelle zu spielen um die dann wieder eingespielte Sequenz Ã¼berspringen zu kÃ¶nnen.

Dass der Lendenschurz und sogar das Metallschloss am Arm von Titus im Fahrstuhl, der sich sehr, sehr langsam bewegt, nach oben geschleudert werden, ist gegen die AbstÃ¼rze natÃ¼rlich nur eine Kleinigkeit. Ich fand es aber lustig, daher wollte ich es nicht unerwÃ¤hnt lassen.



Top erzÃ¤hlte Story
Gemetzel ohne Ende
viele verschiedene Waffen
gute deutsche Sprachausgabe
super Grafik


regelmÃ¤ÃŸige AbstÃ¼rze der Zwischensequenzen
viel zu kurze Story






Eine Toll erzÃ¤hlte Geschichte mit sehr guter Grafik und einem Top Sound inklusive stimmiger deutscher Sprachausgabe. Besser kann die Schlacht um das Universum nicht gefÃ¼hrt werden. Doch halt! Ohne die AbstÃ¼rze wÃ¤re es natÃ¼rlich noch besser. Ich habe das Spiel auf zwei Rechnern und mit mehreren Grafikkarten getestet, leider ohne Erfolg. Ich empfehle das Spiel dennoch und werde hier schreiben, ob das Problem behoben ist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Este juego es una maravilla; es posiblemente uno de los mejores tÃ­tulos que haya salido este aÃ±o, totalmente un 10 de 10. Este juego es un tipo Gears of War con varias mecÃ¡nicas diferentes, pero en sÃ­ es igual de frenÃ©tico.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comenzando con mi reseÃ±a: La historia continÃºa en cierta parte la historia de su predecesor. Si bien no es necesario jugar el anterior, puede ser Ãºtil para entender ciertos aspectos de la historia. Siguiendo con la historia, esta tiene una buena forma de desarrollarse, donde cada cinemÃ¡tica o diÃ¡logo nuevo hace que la historia sea mÃ¡s atrapante. A su vez, los personajes son muy importantes en el desarrollo de la misma historia, como en el primer juego, dÃ¡ndoles mÃ¡s peso sin dejarlos de lado como BOTS que te acompaÃ±an en las misiones. Las misiones, cuya caracterÃ­stica es el escenario perfectamente ambientado que posee este juego, los grÃ¡ficos y la construcciÃ³n de escenarios de este juego son hermosos. Los escenarios son lineales, pero poseen cierta construcciÃ³n que te invita a explorarlos y encontrar cosas bastante Ãºtiles. AdemÃ¡s, los escenarios son bastante intuitivos. Si bien el juego tiene una opciÃ³n de brÃºjula, normalmente no la usÃ© por lo intuitivo que es el escenario y novedoso.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Los enemigos que posee este juego son bastante variados y estÃ¡n colocados muy bien en cada escenario para evitar esa sensaciÃ³n de repetitividad que puede llegar a dar este tipo de juegos. Cada enemigo presenta un nivel de dificultad distinto al otro, dando paso muy importante al cambio de estrategias constante y al uso constante de su sistema de parry y de esquive, sistema que se complementa muy bien con el gameplay, el cual estÃ¡ muy bien pulido y se siente bien de usar. Tal vez en teclado podrÃ­a mejorar un poco algunos mapeos de teclas, pero estÃ¡n bastante bien de igual manera. Volviendo con el gameplay, como mencionÃ© anteriormente, frenetismo puro y duro donde tendremos opciÃ³n de uso de armas a melee, las cuales poseen un sistema de combos, o opciones de armas a distancia, las cuales varÃ­an segÃºn cuÃ¡l elijas. La mÃºsica es otro complemento a este frenetismo hermoso de gameplay, grÃ¡ficos y oleadas de enemigos. La mÃºsica de este juego es hermosa y complementa muy bien el universo de WH40K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aunque algo que no me gustÃ³ para nada es el comportamiento raro que tienen los bots aliados y el poco impacto que pueden llegar a tener en el gameplay. Otra cosa que no me gustÃ³ tanto es que la dificultad fÃ¡cil y normal se sienten muy fÃ¡ciles, mientras que la dificultad difÃ­cil se siente hermosa, y la Ãºltima dificultad presenta todo un reto interesante. Recomiendo jugarlo en difÃ­cil, ya que es donde mÃ¡s sentÃ­ que se disfrutaba el juego. Otra cosa en la que flaquea este juego es en el escenario. Cosas como los barriles explosivos, objetos Ãºtiles como municiÃ³n o medkits no resaltan mucho a la vista,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
De igual manera, este juego se lleva mi votaciÃ³n de GOTY, aunque este Wukong o Astro Bot rondando como otros candidatos, mi fanatismo por el Emperador evita que me convierta en hereje. Sin duda, una sÃ³lida obra maestra que vale totalmente la pena para todos," es una experiencia gratificante y vale totalmente su precio.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jogosan nagy hype volt a Space Marine 2 Ã©rkezÃ©sÃ©re, emiatt egyeseknek csalÃ³dÃ¡s lehet.

Tipikusan egy egyszeri vÃ©gigjÃ¡tszÃ¡sra elÃ©g kategÃ³riÃ¡rÃ³l beszÃ©lÃ¼nk, ami egyÃ©bkÃ©nt jÃ³l sikerÃ¼lt, de semmi extra. A story rÃ¶viden hogy keresztes hadjÃ¡ratot alapÃ­tottak meg azzal a cÃ©llal hogy visszaszerezzÃ©k az elveszett vilÃ¡gokat az ellensÃ©geiktÅ‘l.

LÃ©nyegÃ©ben megyÃ¼nk elÅ‘re Ã©s darÃ¡ljuk az ellenfeleket egy zÃ¡rt pÃ¡lyÃ¡n. IgazsÃ¡g szerint fa Ã©k egyszerÅ± a mechanika Ã©s emellett 6-8 Ã³ra alatt kijÃ¡tszhatÃ³. Ami piros pont hogy az egÃ©sz kampÃ¡nyt 3 fÅ‘s coop jÃ¡tÃ©kmÃ³dban is kilehet vinni. Illetve a story haladtÃ¡val nyÃ­lnak meg Ãºgynevezett operation kÃ¼ldetÃ©sek, amik a fÅ‘ story mellet tÃ¶rtÃ©nnek egy idÅ‘ben, amibÅ‘l Ã¶sszesen 6 kÃ¼ldetÃ©s van. Lehet fejlÅ‘dni, van skill Ã¡gazat, de a multirÃ©sze nem vonzott.

Grafika rendben van, kÃ¶rnyezeti elemek, rÃ©szletek, az egÃ©sz vilÃ¡g lÃ¡tvÃ¡nyosra sikeredett. HangzÃ¡sokrÃ³l pedig annyit tudnÃ©k Ã­rni hogy Ã¡tlagos. Az optimalizÃ¡ciÃ³ra fogjuk rÃ¡ hogy jÃ³l sikerÃ¼lt. Ultra beÃ¡llÃ­tÃ¡sok 1440p, rtx 3080, i7 9700k mellet 70-80 fps van Ã¡tlagban.

Mint negatÃ­vumkÃ©nt elÃ©ggÃ© cpu erÅ‘s jÃ¡tÃ©k. A mai igÃ©nyesebb jÃ¡tÃ©kok max grafikÃ¡val a cpu max 50-55C kÃ¶rÃ¼l mozog, viszont itt a 60-67C simÃ¡n elÃ©ri. A hdr kihagyÃ¡sÃ¡Ã©rt kÃ¡r, az epic kÃ©nyszer telepÃ­tÃ©se pedig tragikus. Az Ã¡ra pedig pÃ©nztÃ¡rca fÃ¼ggÅ‘ hogy kinek Ã©r meg ennyit egy 6-8 Ã³rÃ¡s viszonylag lineÃ¡ris kampÃ¡ny.

Ã‰rtÃ©kelÃ©sem:
Grafika: 4/5
JÃ¡tÃ©kÃ©lmÃ©ny: 3/5
HangzÃ¡sok: 3/5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Slaughtering 41,000 enemies was glorious. Magazine out, magazine in. Wonderful campaign and Operations are a nice continuation. My only complaint is with Operations. If you're playing with a bot and all humans go down, the game ends. I wish we could see if the bot manages to stay alive while our countdown runs out and then we can get back into the game. Exploiting the Bulwark HP regen was awesome while it lasted. Leveling weapons and classes was super easy, and always being able to find randoms for any mission you want to play was nice too. I've been playing since pre-release and haven't had any issues with any of the updates. Ready your Bolters. Lictor these nuts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 es un lanzamiento que se necesitaba en la industria. Este juego nos remarca que no es necesario tenerlo todo y contentar a todo el mundo para tener grandes ventas, basta con tener personalidad y sobre todo compartir la pasiÃ³n que hay a travÃ©s de un proyecto como este.
Se nota la gran dedicaciÃ³n que hay detrÃ¡s y el cariÃ±o que hay por el universo de Warhammer, lleno de referencias y para los nuevos es fÃ¡cil entrar en lo que estÃ¡ ocurriendo.

El combate no perdona, debes ser agresivo, pero medir los tiempos y coordinar con tus compaÃ±eros es vital. por quÃ© en las dificultades altas (quÃ© es donde realmente se ve las intenciones de los desarrolladores) los enemigos te van a arrollar si no te andas con ojo. Todo se reduce al anÃ¡lisis que haces y ver donde te conviene llevar la pelea dadas las circunstancias.

Y me quiero detener en la puesta en escena de este titulo porque es sin lugar a dudas impecable, ver estos escenarios gigantescos y llenos de detalle quÃ© te deja mirando a la distancia.

De Space Marine 2 hay mucho que aprender, junto a otros lanzamientos recientes es un gusto que salga en estos tiempos para callar bocas y reorientar a la industria a un camino mejor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bon, j'ai un R5 5500, une RX 6600, 32Go 3200Mzh, je n'ai CLAIREMENT PAS la config pour ce jeu ET POURTANT, je ne chiale pas car j'ai eu des lag de chargement Ã  la cinÃ©matique d'intro ou autre, mon jeu est sur mon NVME et c'est niquel, je joue en moyen et un peu Ã©levÃ© avec FSR Ã©quilibrÃ© et j'ai du 80 FPS.
Ceux qui se plaignent sont sans doute des dÃ©munies d'intelligence qui viennent des fameux Call of Duty ou autre fameux ""jeu de l'annÃ©e"".
Un jeu Ã§a se paramÃ¨tre et AU NOM DE L'EMPEREUR, apprenez Ã  le faire putain, le jeu est beau, jouissif, sans lag, c'est un GOTY large pour ma part.
Je joue actuellement avec un ami en Ange de la Mort et tout se passe super bien, c'est super bien Ã©quilibrÃ© et ont a pas de problÃ¨mes de lag ou crash ou je ne sais quel excuse Ã  la con.
Focus Ã  repousser la date de sortie, annulÃ© leurs beta et j'en suis ravie. VoilÃ  un jeu qui ne m'avais pas autant fait vibrer et plaisir depuis LONGTEMPS.
En bref, et je reviendrais PEUT-ETRE sur mon avis, ce jeu est un Empereur de l'HumanitÃ©/10.
Je vous laisse sur cela et je repars exterminer des Tyranids par centaines.
Bon jeu et POUR L'EMPEREUR !!!

Je reviens sur mon avis pour dire que j'ai fini la campagne en Ange de la Mort avec un ami et ceux uniquement avec UN SEUL bug qui fut contourner facilement. Ceci dit, Ã  tout ceux qui chialent car ""gngngn c'est trop dur"" ""gngngn c'est buguÃ©"" ou je ne sais quel connerie, achetez-vous du talent ou un ami et faite pas chier. De mÃªme pour les perf, apprenez Ã  paramÃ©trer votre jeu car j'ai eu UNE SEUL cinÃ©matique mal opti, rien d'autre.

Je rajoute, la campagne est un chef d'oeuvre bien plus poussÃ© que bien nombre de jeu, je me suis Ã©merveillÃ© avec mon ami et mÃªme Ã©tant jeune scout dans le monde Warhammer, ce fut un rÃ©gale visuel, auditif, psychologique et j'en passe durant une nuit (oui on a rush la campagne en 1 nuit chut). Dites-vous, Ã§a faisait longtemps que j'avais pas vu des NPC se battre dans une campagne, c'Ã©tait gÃ©nial de pas se sentir seul hÃ©ro de l'Imperium, on a eu des personnage mÃªme sans nom avec qui on s'est battu et on a adorÃ©, Ã§a rajoutais du volume sans que se soit sans Ã¢me, les NPC avait de la vie et Ã§a c'est pas la plus part des guignol de studio d'aujourd'hui qui se ferais chier pour si peux. Aujourd'hui, peu de studios arrivent au niveau de ce mastodonte et c'est normal, la passion, le travail et les connaissances ont pris le dessus et l'argent est passÃ© aprÃ¨s, voilÃ  pour moi des studios matures.

Je remercie vraiment Focus et Saber pour ce jeu, ils mÃ©ritent mon argent et je regrette de pas avoir pris la Collector. La passion Ã©tait de mise et mÃªme pour les inconnu du domaine c'est jouissif. Un immense bravo et merci Ã  eux.
(non je ne lÃ¨che pas les boules car je sais qu'il existe les joueurs PS pour Ã§a avec leurs """"""EXCLU"""""" donc je m'inquiÃ¨te pas pour mon vocabulaire)
Ma note reste la mÃªme.
Merci pour tout.

Bon aller, je rajoute un paragraphe pour un peu d'humilitÃ© en disant quelques points nÃ©gatif.
En premier, les OpÃ©rations ne sont pas faisable en privÃ© entre pote sans qu'un pÃ©gu au micro tout droit sortie du cul d'un Necron rejoigne votre partie et se fasse dÃ©foncer. Vraiment, si c'est pour jouer avec des lÃ¢ches qui chialent en difficultÃ© 2/4 de la campagne, donnez-moi l'IA, elle est bien plus efficaces.
Ensuite, le mode en ligne forcÃ© pour le mode OpÃ©ration. Oui c'est un peu dÃ©rangeant quand on sait que ce mode de jeu est un bac Ã  sable oÃ¹ les Tyranides sont moins violent que le Yorkshire de mamie en menace minime.
AprÃ¨s cela, et Ã§a c'est pour les Ã©ditions Gold et Ultra. Nous n'avons pas accÃ¨s directement aux armures inclu dans la Saison 1 car il faut les dÃ©bloquer avec les fameux points de RÃ©quisition...
Enfin, et celui-lÃ  est un poil plus personnel, on ne reÃ§ois aucune rÃ©compense en fonction de la difficultÃ© dans laquelle on termine la campagne. Je demande pas un Terminator ou une armure de garde Sanguinien mais au moins une distinction, un titre, un logo je sais pas, juste de quoi se rÃ©jouir de nos efforts.
VoilÃ  un peu d'humilitÃ© et de nÃ©gatif pour prouver que oui je sais critiquer mais pas en chialant comme un jeune garde Imperial qui se fait soulever par des Eldar Noir.
Je remercie ceux qui votent positif et rÃ©compense mon avis, l'Empereur vous rÃ©compensera gracieusement, merci beaucoup. Aller, bon jeu Ã  tous et n'oubliez pas : l'Empereur PROTÃˆGE !!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Solid game, but in my opinion it has a lot of problems that make it hard to recommend in its current state. I completed the game on Angel of Death (AOD) solo for reference. I played all the operations coop at least once. I played a few rounds of PVP, I won't comment on that since I didn't really enjoy it.

The good is that it's a direct continuation of the first. I was happy to see show up in the game in a role that made sense. Overall the lore, environments, and audio were fantastic. The hordes of enemies were impressive and some of the set pieces were neat. Just like the first I loved using the jump jets and thunder hammer to crash down on enemies.

There were so many things that combined made this game just not that enjoyable compared to the first for me:
The game feels like it was designed for coop first and everything suffers for it. The campaign is filled with generic objectives like hold the location, press these buttons, etc. They don't feel tailor made for campaign experience but a cooperative one. Everything is forced to load to the useless battle barge before you load into an actual mission. This could easily have just been a UI menu.









I assume most of these issues could be patched for sure and some of them may actually be realistically improved. As it stands though at full price, it's a steep ask for what you get in the package. There is most certainly no longevity to the operations, they are largely static with no variation aside from where/when enemies spawn. PVP is PVP, nothing special. This is a sale game for sure. It does so much right, but the wrong stuff just makes the whole experience feel off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What a fantastic, wonderful lovely dive into the Warhammer 40k universe. So many detail and well placed hints and facts. The Combat animations are great adnd the combos and finishers in combat are gogeous and sometimes funny (Melta pew pew XD) In my opinion one of the greatest and well made games. On many places you can find background infos. You can play the campain with friends too, a huge yes yes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 13 year long wait for a game that delivered correctly on what it needed to do but not on what people may have expected.

SM2 at its best is another great addition to the highly loved horde shooter genre with a WH40K coat of paint on it, with my high love for WH40K it was a great journey to go through this game and be genuinely in awe over environment work and how being a space marine should truly feel.

For some this may not reach the expectations that they had been hoping for after such a long wait, for me i was satisfied with story and length. The COOP experience allowed for a lot more of a immersive time.

This is a genre of game that can always live on and with time if supported with their already shown roadmap, this will easily live up to being one of the best WH40K games next to the Dawn of War series.

Of course with a game like this it is expected that people will get tired of doing the same thing over and over with the minimal amount of content based inside PvE and PVP on launch, for what it is im already 30-40 hours in and still finding fun in spending time making myself look amazing with customization and PVP every now and then.

SM2 delivers on showing what is possible with the WH40K universe in a AAA state and i can only hope that we see more games in this universe and show to GW that their IP is highly loved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I completed the game and every operation on difficulty 2/4.
I do not recommend this game and here is why:
- it feels bad to shoot any weapon other than melta or charged plasma because they deal no damage, it takes more than a clip from any bolt weapon to throw any medium unit into executable state (way way too long), enemies shrug 30-40 direct hits from HEAVY BOLTER like it was a toy gun
- melee is not fun, you get stagger locked and killed by medium enemies
- it feels bad to use chainsword (thunderhammer and power sword feels better but they are not available on 4/6 of operation classes), you cut down the small enemies, but fighting any medium+ is not fun - they will either dodge or play red or blue with you.
- medium+ enemies in melee stagger you with every hit, but your attacks do not
- enemies like to play with you in red and blue, dodge or parry, do it wrong and you lose 50%-75% of health
- enemies are able to teleport or dodge like 10 meters, your dodge is like 1m
- health and armor system is very badly implemented - SM1 had it much better. You cannot recover health with finishers, only armor, yet you lose armor almost instantly. To do a finisher on enemy you need to hit it real good to recover like 1 armor segment.

It is just not fun to play right now.
I do not want to play a class in operations for 10h before it feels fun to play, I want it to feel good from start and then just get better. Most people will play an operation or two, see it is not fun and leave.

Does it have the potential to be great - yes, art is awesome, models are great, campaign is epic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you gave Speesh Muhrine 2 a negative review because no ""UwU"" you will get it before october.

Lo he estado esperando desde hace tiempo y no me ha defraudado. Para mi es el mejor juego de acciÃ³n ambientado en el universo de w40k. GrÃ¡ficamente es un espectÃ¡culo visual, y en cuanto a jugabilidad cumple con creces. Es cierto que hay que mejorar ciertos aspectos, como el tema de servidores, pero espero que en futuras actualizaciones corrijan los defectos.

- J'avais adorer Vermintide 2 et trÃ¨s peu aimÃ© Darktide, mais ce jeux prend tous les bons cÃ´tÃ© des deux et en fait un jeu super en TPS avec un PVP qui change de d'habitude et un PVE rejouable sans s'ennuyer ou sentir le temps long. Le seul point nÃ©gatif c'est qu'on peu jouer qu'en Ã©quipe de 3 maximum. Je recommande.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Don't listen to the gaming Karens. The game is great, there are areas that can be improved like multiplayer connections which seem to be buggy at the moment. However, the story, visuals, and flow of the game is all excellent. If you liked games like gears of war, the previous space marine, or similar games you will love this one as well. But don't be fooled the game on the intended difficulty is not easy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Emperor has provided us with everything we wanted, brothers. Enjoyable story campaign with great visuals, even better PVE operations & fun PVP - very rarely you'll get to experience the whole package in a single game in today's time. And it's executed quite brilliantly as well.

I just wish they could make the gameplay of the campaign as varied & customizable as the Operations mode. Ops are just thousands times more fun. They had the system implemented already, but didn't do it for the campaign. At least, community mods have this covered. And glad to see the devs supporting mods officially as well.

Also, we need FOV slider badly. Ultrawide 21:9 support is at least serviceable, but 32:9 support is a complete whack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE IN OCEANIA!!!!!
There is a currently game breaking bug for Oceania players where you won't be able to load into PVE Operations about 4 out of 5 times.
Bug has persisted since launch and people found a work around, but since latest update/patch the work around is no longer possible.
I REPEAT: If you are in Oceania, hold off buying this game for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Helldivers 2 oynayÄ±p sevdiyseniz bu oyunu da seversiniz. Bu oyunun Helldiverstan farklÄ± olarak dÃ¼zgÃ¼n bi hikaye modu var ve gayet yeterli bunun dÄ±ÅŸÄ±nda pve nin yanÄ±nda pvp nin de olmasÄ± Ã§ok gÃ¼zel olmuÅŸ. Tabi bunu oyunda ilerleyip daha Ã§ok zaman geÃ§irdikten sonra deneyimleyeceÄŸim bu yÃ¼zden pvp konusuna sonradan ayrÄ± bi baÅŸlÄ±k aÃ§mam gerekecek. Oyunun grafikleri Ã§ok gÃ¼zel optimizasyonu da bu grafiklere gÃ¶re normal. OynanÄ±ÅŸ elementlerine gelecek olursak da karakter aÄŸÄ±r zÄ±rhlÄ± bir piyade ve bunu Ã§ok rahat hissediyorsunuz. KanlÄ± ve zorlu dÃ¶vÃ¼ÅŸlerin ardÄ±ndan gÃ¼zel bitiriÅŸ vuruÅŸlarÄ± da tuzu biberi oluyor oyunun. Oyundan baÅŸlangÄ±Ã§ olarak yeterince memnun kaldÄ±m ama Ã¶zet geÃ§ecek olursam:

ARTILARI :
Grafikleri
DÃ¶vÃ¼ÅŸlerin eÄŸlenceli ve rafine oluÅŸu
Hikayesinin herkese hitap etmesi
woke,sjw olmamasÄ± has erkek adam oyunu olmasÄ±

EKSÄ°LERÄ° :
Yok ki demek isterdim ama var
Oyunu ilk indirdiÄŸimizde epic launcher istemesine sinir oldum
Optimizasyon ortalama demiÅŸtim ama yer yer dÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼yor
SaldÄ±rÄ± ÅŸemalarÄ± klavye mause iÃ§in karÄ±ÅŸÄ±k geldi bu yÃ¼zden gamepad ile oynayacaÄŸÄ±m

SONUÃ‡ : Evet pahalÄ± bi oyun ama bunun tek sorumlusu akp ve destekÃ§ileri yani akp liyseniz bu oyunun pahalÄ± olmasÄ± sizin suÃ§unuz bu yÃ¼zden fiyata laf edemezsiniz. Normal vatandaÅŸlara gelecek olursak da serinin Ã§ok hayranÄ± deÄŸilseniz indirim bekleyebilirsiniz diÄŸer firmalar gibi Ã§oook uzun sÃ¼re indirime sokmayacaklarÄ±nÄ± dÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼nmÃ¼yorum ama normal fiyattan da alsanÄ±z bi ÅŸekilde verdiÄŸiniz paranÄ±n hakkÄ±nÄ± verecek bi oyun. 2-3 kez arkadaÅŸlarÄ±nÄ±zla dÄ±ÅŸarÄ± Ã§Ä±kmak yerine bu oyunu alÄ±p 10 kez dÄ±ÅŸarÄ±da geÃ§ireceÄŸiniz zamanÄ± bypass edip totalde karlÄ± bile Ã§Ä±kabilirsiniz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lâ€™Empereur nous protÃ¨ge !

Lâ€˜Histoire : 3.5/4

La PlanÃ¨te Kadaku est sous la menace des Tyranides, des XÃ©nos voraces sur le point dâ€™assimiler tout le systÃ¨me.
La 2ieme Compagnie dâ€™Ultramarines est dÃ©pÃªchÃ©e sur place pour tenter de stopper lâ€™invasion â€?
Lâ€™histoire de Warhammer 40k : Space Marine 2 se dÃ©roule 100 ans aprÃ¨s le premier volet, sorti il y a 13 ans. Il nâ€™est pas indispensable dâ€™avoir jouÃ© au premier pour suivre lâ€™histoire mÃªme si câ€™est mieux (lire un rÃ©sumÃ© sur internet vous aidera). Pour le reste, les fans de W40k seront aux anges avec lâ€™utilisation soignÃ©e du lore et des rÃ©fÃ©rences de lâ€™univers. Les profanes pourront peut-Ãªtre se perdre un peu, mais prendront un grand plaisir Ã  se plonger dedans sâ€™ils ne sont pas rebutÃ©s par un univers dur et emplis de violence.


Ici, place Ã  lâ€™action, de bout en bout, un peu Ã  la maniÃ¨re dâ€™un Gear of War. La campagne principale nâ€™est pas longue en soit. Mais elle vous emmÃ¨ne sur un rail dâ€™action du dÃ©but Ã  la fin, entrecoupÃ©e de cinÃ©matiques vous transposant dans lâ€™action et dans lâ€™histoire.
Jouable au clavier/souris (vous allez rebind vos touches trÃ¨s probablement) ou Ã  la manette (il est plus probable que le jeu ai Ã©tÃ© pensÃ© pour ce pÃ©riphÃ©rique dans ses contrÃ´les), lâ€™action vous embarque sur du tir Ã  distance, du corps Ã  corps, de lâ€™esquive, de la parade, du contre, des exÃ©cutions/finish, etcâ€?On sâ€™emmÃªle parfois les pinceaux au dÃ©but entre les esquives et les parades (signalÃ©es respectivement par un signal rouge et un signal bleu), ce qui ne pardonne pas dÃ¨s la difficultÃ© normale.

Toute la campagne est faisable en coop Ã  trois joueurs, en revanche, et câ€™est clairement regrettable, celui qui lance la campagne progresse dans son histoire, mais ceux qui lâ€™accompagnent ne progressent pas dans la leur et devront donc refaire les missions pour la faire progresser dans leur propre partie. Alors si lâ€™on considÃ¨re que la campagne ne dure quâ€™entre 10 et 15h, dâ€™action pure et dure, ce nâ€™est pas trop regrettable, mais câ€™est tout de mÃªme dommage quâ€™une progression conjointe nâ€™ai pas Ã©tÃ© mise, surtout avec les reports quâ€™on lui connait.

Pour le reste, dans la mÃªlÃ©e, lâ€™action est au rendez-vous. On regrettera peut-Ãªtre un combat Ã  distance un peu plus en retrait avec des armes dont les dÃ©gÃ¢ts sont beaucoup trop faibles vis-Ã -vis de ce quâ€™ils pourraient Ãªtre si lâ€™on suit les rÃ¨gles Warhammer. Mais on ne boude nÃ©anmoins pas notre plaisir de lÃ¢cher quelques coups de Bolter Lourd ou de lance plasma, ou encore de Fuseur.
On pourra cataloguer ce titre comme Ã©tant un jeu couloir, mais le game design est tellement rÃ©ussi que câ€™est un plaisir de le parcourir et de dÃ©couvrir quâ€™au fond de notre champs de vision les hordes qui se dirige vers nous ne sont pas que des simples animations mais bien des Gaunts qui viendront au contact.

Enfin, outre la campagne, le jeu vous propose deux autres modes, le mode Pvp (Guerre Eternelle), dans lequel vous pouvez customizer votre personnage, ainsi que le mode OpÃ©ration (PvE) dans lequel vous customizer distinctement un autre personnage pour rÃ©aliser des missions (6 actuellement) en coop Ã  3 (ou avec lâ€™IA) pour en apprendre plus sur lâ€™histoire de la campagne (missions annexes) et faire progresser votre personnage (systÃ¨me de progression des armes etcâ€?. Des heures de bagarres contre les HÃ©rÃ©tiques et les XÃ©nos en perspective.



Ici, pas de Ray tracing. Saber a fait lâ€™impasse sur les derniÃ¨res technologies ou en tout cas les plus rÃ©centes. Il nâ€™en demeure pas moins la prÃ©sence du DLSS pour les possesseurs dâ€™une carte Nvidia.
Par ailleurs, au-delÃ  de ces choix, Saber a rÃ©ussi un tour de force au niveau de lâ€™ambiance et de la D.A. de son titre. Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2 transpire lâ€™univers de Games Workshop du dÃ©but Ã  la fin, et le visuel renforce la puissance de la narration du titre.
En outre, vous ne verrez aucune diffÃ©rence entre les cutscene et les phases de jeu. Un vrai plaisir.
Avec une RTX4080, un i5 13600k et 32 Go de Ram en 1440p, le jeu tourne en moyenne Ã  95 FPS sur Ã©cran 165hz tous les rÃ©glages en Ultra.


Lâ€™ambiance sonore est inÃ©gale. En cela que le son, de base, est vraiment trÃ¨s faible. Tout Ã  100%, les dialogues sont peu audibles, les musiques sont sourdes, de mÃªme que les bruits des armes. Il vous faudra surement jouer avec votre mÃ©langeur de volume pour rÃ©gler au mieux votre expÃ©rience sonore et profiter au mieux du titre.
PassÃ© ce dÃ©tail, lâ€™ambiance est excellente mÃªme si on aurait aimÃ© des musiques peut Ãªtre plus Ã©piques dans les phases cruciales.
Le son des armes quant Ã  lui devient excellent et rend hommage Ã  chacune dâ€™entre elles.


Techniquement, le titre est trÃ¨s propre. Aucun ralentissement, aucun freeze, aucun plantage ou bug Ã  dÃ©plorer.
La VF est super propre.
On soulÃ¨vera tout le moins deux dÃ©tails : des temps de chargements trop rÃ©guliers et assez long, mÃªme sur SSD ; et un 95 Fps avec une config musclÃ©e ? Un peu gourmand non ?. Au-delÃ  de Ã§a, le jeu souffre de quelques soucis de matchmaking pour les opÃ©rations.
Cela Ã©tant, le lien avec lâ€™Epic Games nâ€™est pas obligatoire, et nâ€™est nÃ©cessaire que pour les joueurs dÃ©sireux de jouer avec les copains qui auraient le jeu sur la plateforme Epic Games. Sinon ce nâ€™est pas nÃ©cessaire et cela peut Ãªtre passÃ© sans soucis.


Warhammer 40000 : Space Marine 2, sâ€™il nâ€™invente rien, offre une narration exemplaire et un plaisir total dans lâ€™univers de Games Workshop du dÃ©but Ã  la fin. Le Mode OpÃ©ration et le PvP sont lÃ  pour faire durer le plaisir. Avec une D.A. excellente, il saura ravir les fans autant que les profanes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UPD: So, I finished the campaign after almost 9h. Honestly, I feel like raising my score to a solid 9/10, it somehow kept getting better and more epic every hour. I haven't even touched the operations and PVP yet, but I'm ready for more gameplay, it was awesome. Could you find some nitpicks? Sure, I heard some people saying that it's too coop oriented, finishers don't give you health the same way as in the first game, etc, but I personally loved it. One of the best 40K games out there at this point.

EARLY REVIEW

Iâ€™ve gotta say - before I played it myself, I had a healthy dose of doubts and was just cautiously optimistic about this game, but man - itâ€™s a blast so far! Considering the amount of epicness happening at all times, it is surprisingly well optimized and runs at very stable 60 with all high settings. The main thing that might bottleneck for some people is CPU, so you might wanna check that (thankfully I have no problems with it).

Gameplay-wise, itâ€™s quite fun, more engaging and deeper than the first game, but it is more coop/online oriented (however, I have no issues playing it solo currently).

Story-wise - pretty much what you might expect from an action game based in the 40k. Nothing groundbreaking, but the tone is great, and characters are enjoyable.

Graphics, art, sound design - really impressed, you can feel the scale of big war, but at the same time there are little details everywhere that fans will surely appreciate. Guns and music are more meaty this time around, which I love.

Long story short - if you like solid, gripping action, and of course, the 40k universe, then itâ€™s a must! GO SLAY SOME TYRANIDS FOR THE EMPEROR, BROTHER

Early score - 8.5/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 - Review

Tuvo sus retrasos. Tuvo sus filtraciones. Tuvo todo en contra, pero finalmente estÃ¡ aquÃ­. Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 es una realidad. Todo lo que cualquier seguidor del universo Warhammer podrÃ­a esperar. Una explosiÃ³n de testosterona. FrenÃ©tico. Intenso. Sangriento. Salvaje. Ese servo armadura me recordÃ³ a Gears of War. Joder, como se lo extraÃ±a al Marcus y Dom. En Gameplay es un carrusel de alto voltaje con unas desmedidas cuotas de acciÃ³n. Un festÃ­n de tiroteos para cualquier amante de los shooters. GrÃ¡ficamente tiene planos fenomenales con una ingente cantidad de bichos, peroâ€?comienza a hacer ruido cuando ponemos la lupa en sus rostros o el propio entorno. Lucen bastante genÃ©ricos. QuizÃ¡s por eso el rendimiento es tan bueno. Tiene una optimizaciÃ³n brillante. Tampoco necesita demasiado equipo para correr bien. Los niveles son mÃ¡s bien pasillos perpetuos. En fin, Space Marine 2 es una sobredosis de acciÃ³n, tanta que dejara en coma tras unas horas. El hogar de cualquier fanÃ¡tico de los shooter y el terror de cualquier hemofÃ­lico.


*Bastante fiel al universo de Warhammer 40K.
*El regreso de Titus, todo un machote estoico.
*Los ejambres y las oleadas, dejan postales alucinantes.
*Un curiosa cruza entre Gears of War y DMC o GOW.
*Esa constante dosis de adrenalina en su Gameplay.
*Los modelados de la servo armadura son estupendos, peroâ€?



*Los rostros no son de lo mejor.
*Los escenarios se me antojan algo lineales y se pierde ese sentido de verticalidad.
*Algun que otro pico de dificultad en solitario.
*Ciertos bugs o CTD como producto de la incompatibilidad con algunas versiones de MSI Afterburner.

Positives:
- Some of the best graphics around
- Wonderful melee combat and good gun combat to
- Voice acting is done well
- Music and other audio is done good
- Decent story
- A great lean and very fun campaign with no filler
- Performance for me was good the whole game, never below 60fps w everything cranked
- No crashes during the whole campaign
- Addicting gameplay
- Atmosphere is great, with so many enemies around feels like a real war
- Fun Coop
- No BS in the game, just a good old fashioned kicking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ videogame
- Level design is awesome
- TONS of enemies everywhere!

Negatives:
- Campaign could have had another mission or 2
- The only mission I didn't like was the flying around in space, although short it wasn't needed
- Please allow people to have the same class in COOP, very annoying to have to switch


These are my thoughts so far after only beating the campaign, going to try some Coop next and maybe a little PVP but I don't see myself playing a ton of that. I will def be coming back to this game to in the future when more Coop missions are added and especially when the Horde mode is added, that should be wonderful fun with how good this combat system is.

Def one of the best Warhammer games to date, probably tied with GOW2 as my favorite all time Warhammer game and has made me reinstall GOW2, Hired Gun & Darktide again to get some more Warhammer action in, very good game and one of 2024's best without a doubt (Probably #3 on my top 10 list this year).

I do love my big epic, super long rpgs but I do love when a well done lean and mean campaign comes around that is about 7-8 hours and very well done. No filler, no extra bs, just get down to business and that is alot of fun. Well done to the devs, they nailed the Warhammer feel very well. As good as the first Space Marine game was, this is a good deal better imo, better graphics, combat is better and it has a more epic feel to it. Pretty much Space Marine 1 with classic Gears of War mix in, fantastic campaign overall.

FOR THE EMPEROR!

**Tried a Coop mission, it was great fun, hectic gameplay and cool character creator/customization and leveling up to. Just wish you could be the same class as your friend, instead of having to switch. For PVP I can see having that in maybe, but not in Coop**",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Es el 41Â° Milenio. Durante mÃ¡s de cien siglos, el Emperador se ha sentado inmÃ³vil en el Trono Dorado de Terra. Es el Amo de la Humanidad por voluntad de los dioses, y amo de un millÃ³n de mundos por el poder de sus ejÃ©rcitos inagotables. Es un cadÃ¡ver en descomposiciÃ³n que se retuerce de forma invisible con el poder de la tecnologÃ­a de La Edad Oscura. Es el SeÃ±or CarroÃ±ero del Imperio por quien se sacrifican mil almas todos los dÃ­as , para que nunca muera realmente. Sin embargo, incluso en su estado inmortal, el Emperador continÃºa su eterna vigilancia. Poderosas flotas de batalla cruzan el miasma infestado de demonios de la Disformidad, la Ãºnica ruta entre estrellas distantes, su camino iluminado por el AstronomicÃ³n, la manifestaciÃ³n psÃ­quica de la voluntad del Emperador. Vastos ejÃ©rcitos dan batalla en su nombre en incontables mundos. Los mejores entre sus soldados son los Adeptus Astartes, los Marines Espaciales , superguerreros de bioingenierÃ­a. Sus camaradas de armas son legiÃ³n: la Guardia Imperial e innumerables fuerzas de defensa planetaria, la siempre vigilante InquisiciÃ³n y los tecnosacerdotes del Adeptus Mechanicus .por nombrar sÃ³lo algunos. Pero a pesar de todas sus multitudes, apenas son suficientes para contener la amenaza siempre presente de alienÃ­genas, herejes, mutantes y cosas peores. Ser un hombre en esos tiempos es ser uno entre miles de millones . Es vivir en el rÃ©gimen mÃ¡s cruel y sanguinario imaginable . Estos son los cuentos de aquellos tiempos. OlvÃ­dese del poder de la tecnologÃ­a y la ciencia, porque se ha olvidado tanto que nunca se volverÃ¡ a aprender. Olvida la promesa de progreso y comprensiÃ³n, porque en el sombrÃ­o y oscuro futuro solo hay guerra . No hay paz entre las estrellas , solo una eternidad de carnicerÃ­a y matanza, y la risa de los dioses sedientos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Los Space Marine estÃ¡n en la lÃ­nea de los Gears pero con el lore de Warhammer. Esta continuaciÃ³n es mÃ¡s brutal y sangriento que el primero, grÃ¡ficamente es muy espectacular, todo luce increÃ­ble. El juego es completamente lineal y va al grano, asÃ­ que no esperes exploraciÃ³n. En cuanto al rendimiento puedo decir que no tengo quejas, en una 4070 a 1440p con todo mÃ¡ximo y DLSS en calidad, rinde una tasa media entre 80/90fps.
Me ha resultado extraÃ±o ver configuraciÃ³n del DLSS, pero ni rastro del FG. AsÃ­ como tampoco funciona el mando de Xbox, pese a estar metido en la propia configuraciÃ³n del juego. Supongo que ambas cosas se puedan solucionar con algÃºn parche posterior, ya que hablamos del juego en acceso anticipado. Es un juegazo y mÃ¡s si lo juegas en compaÃ±Ã­a, nada da mÃ¡s placer que matar y aplastar hordas de bichejos. POR EL EMPERADOR!!

Great game, Really is

Sadly corrupted with Abominable Intelligence, the bots are shocking.
The first instance its really notable is the tower defence, they dont play the objective, they dont target key enemies such as bosses or creatures that buff the swarm.
I have been left bleed out after one got stuck on a rock, silly issues but all with the bots sadly.

This is another one of those games where I really wish there was a neutral option for Steam reviews.

My review is based off of a solo campaign completed on veteran difficulty, all operations completed and a decent amount of multiplayer.

Space Marine 2 is a large step up from it's predecessor and improves on almost every aspect of graphics and gameplay. The controls are familiar to anybody who's played games that require timing and elevated awareness. At the beginning it stays true to the lore to a point but quickly starts to suffer from ""main character syndrome"" as the story progresses. The multiplayer offering is interesting but not enough to keep me coming back for any length of time.

I understand the hype surrounding the title but I can't really get my head around why nobody is discussing the game's very obvious shortcomings, at least in my opinion.

The longer I played the story the more I started to realise that the structure of almost every single mission is identical to the last. The layout of almost every mission is as follows; Begin after a short cutscene, run through a linear level and kill groups of enemies, eventually you'll hit a large area which is handcrafted to show off the games ""swarm engine"" which is basically a point defence for a couple of minutes which was painfully obvious that it was ripped straight out of World War Z (especially the enemies climbing on top of one another to reach you at the top of a high wall and the whole 'hitting the base of the tower to make them collapse mechanic'). You proceed to the end then watch another short cutscene, rinse and repeat for between 8-10 hours. Pretty much the entire bulk of Space Marine 2 is defend this objective, defend that objective, defend the next objective or fight a boss in a small arena area. Another section it shamelessly ripped off from another game was the dodging debris left and right as you thrust around the screen identical to Dead Space 2 and 3. During the campaign you unlock six side-missions known as Operations which take place alongside Damocles Squad in the timeline of the main story, this is also something I couldn't quite understand, this mode has decent amounts of customisation, skill trees, weapon trees, currencies and unlock paths... to play on only 6 short missions with no variation, hmm. I played all of these once and seen no reason to come back to play them again since I knew the story and what to expect, I also found that progression does not carry over into your campaign character so I was really trying to find out what the purpose of this mode actually was, jury is still out on that one.

The multiplayer isn't something I'm really going to comment on because some people love it in games, others just don't bother with it, I'm of the latter.

Overall the story was... okay. The characters are well voiced and interesting in their own respects until you realise that literally half of the campaign is just your squad mates bickering back and forth about how much of a traitor you are, which in the grand scheme of things makes sense but after hours of hearing it I just began to get irritated and closed off from it. Toward the end of the story there is so much plot armour and so much main character syndrome I just ended up sighing when the credits rolled, feeling more bored than accomplished.

Just a side note before closing; I'm curious why instead of taking part in these epic final battles toward the end and physically fighting my way through, I was instead forced to sit and watch a handful of short cutscenes, one even held my hand and forced me to move in a certain way in order to progress while I literally just sat back and watched my character move on his own. Strange, it's almost like they were trying to rush through it to finish the game in time but I could be wrong.

In summary, I think that Space Marine 2 is a visually impressive title and should definitely be commended for bringing the Warhammer 40K universe to life in the way that it does but for me personally it simply doesn't bring enough to keep me interested for any length of time and once the story is completed and all the operations the only replayability I found was in the multiplayer which personally I have no interest in myself.

Ultimately it verges into a not recommended from me with all the negative points considered, if I could give neutral reviews, I would for this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loving the game so far. Iâ€™ve experienced a couple of crashes and server issues here and there, but the positives greatly outweigh the negatives. The gameplay is great, the graphics are beautiful, and most importantly, THE GAME IS FUN (something rare these days)â€”an amazing sequel altogether.

i dont think ive ever given a review to a game before but this game ends it today. im really torn on it because i can see all the hard work they have put into this game but it feels so empty. maybe my problem is that im playing solo, but this game is so boring. the game is beautiful and the storyline itself is great. the controls feel almost too simplistic, why couldnt we get a take cover button? the AI is so bad at helping during the campaign its like why even have them at all? they when they are on the jetpack missions they just fly and fall off the map or are never close to you unless you stand still for a minute. the jetpack controls are the worst thing ive ever used. the campaign levels are so empty, go here kill this group of mobs, then hold interact, and repeat over and over. i felt like i spent more time holding the interact button then i did playing the story. why can you just pick up ammo boxes with interact button but with grenades you have to hold down the button to collect them? all the medkits that are just trophy collections because they are clipped into the ground and cant be interacted with. the only collectibles ive found were datapads, and the invisible walls made it very empty and bland. i havent even tried PVE or PVP mode yet, but all of my complaints are purely campaign at this point. im sure the game is meant to be played with a party of 3, but im having a hard time wanting to finish this campaign because it just is so painful to play solo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prima di tutto, il gioco Ã¨ estremamente corto, la campagna sono a malapena una decina di ore e conta molto sul fatto che tu voglia rifare le stesse 6 missioni coop decine di volte per sbloccare i cosmetici e livellare le 6 classi con le rispettive armi (il pvp non l'ho ancora provato e non credo lo farÃ² a breve), perÃ² Ã¨ veramente divertente e pur avendo solo 6 missioni da ripetere e ripetere non diventano noiose immediatamente grazie alla randomicitÃ  degli spawn di nemici e delle risorse, il combattimento Ã¨ ben studiato, le mosse finali sono spettacolari e le armi sono tutte piÃ¹ o meno utili in base al tuo playstyle. In piÃ¹ il fatto che non ci sia contaminazione woke Ã¨ assolutamente un enorme pregio.
Detto questo posso affermare che il gioco Ã¨ un ottimo gioco anche se, per la mancanza di contenuto, aspetterei qualche sconto per comprarlo se non vi interessa di supportare i devs e di impartire una sonora lezione alla SBI e a chi ci perde soldi appresso",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Honestly, the first half of the campaign didnâ€™t grab me as much as I expected. I initially thought it aimed to be a 40K [Space Marine] version of the other fellow Warhammer titles like Darktide and Vermintide but the Focus Entertainment version of them given the tricks it also borrowed from A Plague Tale and Aliens: Fireteam Elite. That would have been an overstatement for sure. Saber Interactive is turbulent as a developer but they did a solid job here.

While the Tyranid invasion dominates most of the game, and it ultimately means facing hive-mind swarms, the game flowed better once Chaos elements started to involve in the story. When you start sparring off against the Adeptus Mechanicus, the pacing improves. Although I dislike certain objectives in SM2, such as ""Hold off against the enemies until X is completed,"" they are acceptable for a standard TPS shooter campaign as long as the game flows well. And well, SM2 does flow. It features strong moment-to-moment gameplay, with frequent switches between melee and ranged combat, making it a good hybrid of hack-and-slash and shooter. The campaign also include a somewhat enjoyable final boss to end it all, intense action sequences, and varied elements like platforming and jetpack usage, reminiscent of the first game. There are even gameplay sequences involving a flamethrower against swarming rats. Sounded familiar? :)

The campaign (and by extension, PvE missions) has scarce supplies, especially in terms of aids. On higher difficulties, you need to use melee combat to fend off large groups of enemies [minoris] to conserve ammo, while also keeping an eye on Majoris enemies that provide armor upon execution. Executing these enemies requires parries and melee chains, which might remind you of Doom Eternal. Engaging in combat and switching tactics is often rewarding in SM2. My only small complaint is that there should have been a way to replenish health, similar to Doom Eternal. PvE is where the difficulty is to be more relied as you have only a few chances to be revived before you ultimately doomed to fail. In campaign even if you play one of the higher 2 difficulties you rarely worry about that and your companions are almost unbeatable because they are simply there to revive you and their health rarely goes low. From time to time I thought running a co-op campaign at the highest difficulty would have been much harder as my partner sucked more than the AI, lol. The scarcity in co-op becomes much more evident as the game would offer only 2 health packages at most although it would offer a cache to replenish ammo infinitely- again in a similar fashion to Aliens: Fireteam Elite.

PvE missions offer limited replayability unless you aim to master them on higher difficulties and grind for cosmetics. Which I really did not want to but it ends up being a personal thing. However, six PvE missions at launch isnâ€™t too bad. Completing each mission adds another 3 to 6 hours of gameplay, which I appreciated. They had variety, though the environments and enemies are recycled. Some moments in these missions would have been great additions to the campaign (such as the Drake fight). I view PvE missions as an extension of the campaign, and with promises of more enemies and maps in the future, I hope PvE content will become more diverse and intriguing over time.

PvP was unplayable during my pre-release playthrough, and I haven't had enough time to explore it post-release. You use the same classes in both PvP and PvE, though you can customize them differently for each mode. The PvP is a 6v6 battleâ€”far from perfect, but even with limited play, I found it to be a mode worth revisiting occasionally. Matches are quick, taking around 10 minutes, and the flow is smooth. SM2 currently lacks a battle pass or premium system for unlocking cosmetics, offering only free content and some season pass content throughout the year. So, thereâ€™s no fear of missing out. If SM2's PvP were a standalone mode, it might barely suffice, but as an addition to the main game, it feels fairly generous. Itâ€™s reminiscent of beloved 2010s multiplayer modes that came with a campaign, like TLOUâ€™s Factions if you take a moment to recognize how beloved it was for a simple additional mp mode.

The visual fidelity and art design are standout features in this game. SM2 effectively captures the depth and the scale of Warhammer 40K universe with some of the most visually pleasing environments Iâ€™ve seen, despite being set in a war-torn setting. There are almost no janky parts, and everything executes well, including the execution animations. The bloodbath during intense combat is gratifying, and the sound design is excellent, with each weapon having a distinctive sound that enhances the experience of firing a bolt carbine to a multi-meta or swinging a thunder hammer.

The optimization isnâ€™t the best, but I managed to get 40-50 FPS most of the time with a 3080 Ti/12700KF setup, playing on High presets with DLSS set to Balanced. Iâ€™ve seen worse, so Iâ€™ll take it.

I am quite impressed with this game both in terms of its gameplay and visuals after finishing the introduction. I'm excited to start playing the rest of the game in co-op with my sister. However, I cannot ever recommend a game that forcibly installs unnecessary Epic Games bloatware on your PC upon initial launch. I bought* a Steam game to play with other players on Steam only. (*Well actually, my lovely sister gifted me the game, but my statement remains otherwise the same. Thank you so much, sis! ^-^),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fortunately, as long as you don't care about crossplay, the game is entirely functional without Epic Games Online and it can be easily removed from the installation. Here's how to do so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) Launch the game. The game will immediately attempt to install Epic Online Services. Cancel the installation box before it finishes. You will be met with an error message upon reaching the main menu. The EOS was never successfully installed, but remnants of the software are still on your machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2) Turn off crossplay in the game options menu of the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) Close the game. Uninstall Epic Online Services from the list of programs on your computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4) Delete the Epic Online Services folder from the game's installation folder in your Steam library.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5) Reboot your computer and relaunch the game. The game will greet you with the error message when you reach the main menu whenever you start the game," but EOS will never again attempt to install itself on your machine. The game is fully functional without crossplay. Enjoy Space Marine 2!""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I overall love this game but ive taken my thumbs up away until you either nerf the power fist weapon in pvp or the bulwark class. The stats for powerfist look bad but yet im watching people 1 shot any class with it even heavy and bulwark classes. So youve put a talentless weapon on a low skill class. Either the power fist needs heavy nerfs to oblivion or you need to nerf bulwark so that its shield can only take so many hits before needing to recharge similar to heavy class in pvp. Theres no reason a class is having god mode in a frontal cone and then just 1 shotting people on repeat. Fix this and you earn your thumbs up back.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its honestly not a terrible game. The campaign is decent enough, and i did like the characters a good bit. But the gameplay, especially in Operations is rather shallow. It doesn't sell that power fantasy of being a Primaris Ultramarine. Many weapons do not feel good to use and the build diversity is rather shallow. The depth of mechanics is also quite shallow as well, Exemplified by a single key press letting you basically take your hands off the keyboard for a second or two because of a drawn out (albeit badass) execution animation. Lacks good horde numbers too. There just isnt enough enemies to sell me on the fact im facing a world ending threat.

Is it a bad game? Absolutely not. if you do buy this there is a good chance you'll enjoy it. But at 60 usd i cannot personally say its worth the money until they add.. More. More Builds, More Depth, More Missions.
Its a mid game that costs too much in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very tough decision for me to give this a not recommended review, but I think there are some glaring issues that should be addressed.

First off, the pros:
1. It looks great. Starting from the bigger things. The game is set on three very different and distinct planets: Kadaku, a jungle world, Avarax, a hive world and Demerium, a cemetery world. Each of the planets have their very own distinct style and feel to it. Then down to the smaller details. There are a lot of details in the game that also breath life into the game and adds to the whole WH40K experience. Bravo.
2. The gameplay is great. If you enjoyed the first space marine game, odds are, you will enjoy this one as well. The melee and shooting all feel very satisfying. Popping off a headshot or pulling off a finisher all feel very satisfying.
3. The story is pretty good. I mean, Warhammer games are not always known for having interesting stories, especially also considering this game is supposed to be a hack and slash kinda brainless fun game. All in all, I enjoyed the story thus far. Additional points go to the fact that the coop missions are also parallel to the main missions.

Next, onto the cons:
1. The story is a bit short for its price. There are 7 main story missions (8 if you count prologue) and 5 coop missions that will help flesh out the main story missions (6 if you count Ballistic engine, which isn't really mentioned anywhere in the main missions). I did the game on Angels of Death difficulty and it should take about 15 hours to complete. If you count the coop missions in, it should take about 25-30 hours in total if you wanna enjoy the whole story at least once. Slightly on the short side for the price they are charging.
2. It can be a real grindfest. Tying into the last point. What it does not have in length, it makes up for the sheer amount of grind you will need to do. To unlock all the armor sets for each class, you need to play 35 matches per class, with a total of 210 matches. Assuming you don't do PvP like I do, let's assume each match takes 30 minutes (I think that's the bare minimum unless you do speedrun), and you win every single match. That is like 100+ hours right there that requires you to grind. Now, I'm not against having a lot of coop time to pad out the game time, but since there are only six maps, things can get stale real soon. I hate doing comparisons, but If you compare it with games like Vermintide 2. Vermintide 2 had 13 missions in total when it first launched, which will ensure a relatively healthy mix of varied missions. Here's hoping the devs would add in more coop missions down the line.
3. Twitch drops. Really? I mean, all the clown awards that went into the announcement post should be telling. It is one thing to do exclusive twitch drops that requires you to watch it (since you can just leave it in the background), it is altogether another to require people subbing and giving out subscriptions. This is toxic.

All in all, I enjoyed the game itself, but I really do not enjoy some of the other decisions the devs made for the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm amending my initial review in the wake of the 4.1 patch. Snippets of the original review will be referenced below for the sake of continuity (not all of it, because character limits), but reading the original won't have been necessary.

Bottom line up front: if you're a fan of 40k, really like co-op PvE games, and don't mind dropping 60 bones on a game that's light on content right now, you can probably go ahead and snag this without being too disappointed. If you aren't described by all three of those points -- definitely wait for a sale. Honestly, you're probably better off waiting for a sale even if you're fine with all that.

Changing my review to a recommendation, with some caveats. The core of what's here is solid, but there are enough negatives that I have to add some points of caution to that.

Starting with the positives: the game good. Some of the guns are still somewhat lackluster in spite of recent tweaks intended to buff their viability in later difficulties, but it's still possible to get through the highest difficulties with anything on the table. Gunplay isn't the highlight here though -- melee is where SM2 shines. If you run parry-centric builds in souls-likes, you'll be right at home here. While there are non-parry focused melee weapon options available, one of the chief mechanics players rely on is recovering armor (think of it as a regenerating shield) through executions. It is also possible to recover armor by parrying small enemies that attack you (""minoris"" enemies, as the game terms them) -- so being able to parry efficiently is one of the main ways to stay alive in this game. It's a blast in co-op, and frankly that's where I've spent all but two or so hours of time in this game.

I'm not the biggest 40k fan, but from everything I've seen they've been true to the lore of the 40k universe. This is likely because GW is intensely protective of their IP, and had granular input on seemingly pointless details like the specific look of ankle armor for the Space Marines. If lore accuracy is important to you, you'll appreciate this game.

All that said...there are some issues that are still in play.

Out the gate, the content for the game is fairly thin. The Campaign mode can be completed in roughly 6-8 hours if you're taking your time or still learning mechanics, and the Operations mode (where I suspect most players spend most of their time -- at least, that's the case for me) has 7 different missions right now. Each of those missions can be finished in 30-45 minutes, depending on how thoroughly you scour the environment for items. There's a PvP mode, but it's seemingly an afterthought that was just bolted on, because there's only three maps available there, and balancing there is .

In fact, the dev team for Space Marine 2 with the concept of balance in both PvP and PvE. Part of the furor over the 4.0 patch was due to changes that nerfed the existing meta strategies, without providing alternatives, effectively destroying the power fantasy aspect of their power fantasy game. Recent changes have moved the needle more towards this being an actual balancing effort, but there's still work to do.

Example: in my initial review, I had complaints about nerfs applied to the melta bomb -- a single charge grenade type deployable that was being used to deal massive amounts of damage to Terminus (mini-boss) and larger enemies. The approach taken by the devs was to reduce the damage these items do to those enemies by 70%. Thus, a melta bomb does just about nothing to a mini-boss, but a krak grenade will still take away chunks of its health -- and you get two krak grenades per pick up.

As I stated previously -- there's already a mechanic that limits the amount of damage a melta bomb can do, and it's called ""item rarity."" You start a round with three frag grenades. If you get a melta bomb, it's because the RNG saw fit to give you one. A melta bomb is supposed to be a big, nuclear option tool used to deal with big hordes or big enemies. If it can't do that job, what incentive do we have to take it?

Another issue is that this dev team has a habit of making changes to the game without documenting them. The problem here is that if the community has no idea what changes have been made to core elements of gameplay, it's going to be impossible for players to provide meaningful feedback on those changes, leaving us to just guess or go off vibes that something ""feels different."" If you're shooting from the hip and making changes to your game without telling people what's getting tweaked, you're setting yourself up for public outcry, and you deserve every ounce of grief you get in response.

fact, the dev team is fairly bad at communicating with users n general. Prior to the 4.0 patch, the community was told that the upcoming changes would include a new map, additional cosmetics and a new weapon. The map dropped, but the other items are still MIA, and so far as I've seen, the devs have not provided any information clarifying a different release date for these items, or an explanation for their absence.

Finally, there are still a handful of ""little"" problems that take away from the whole experience. I still occasionally see a bug where weapon XP is not properly allocated to the weapon used during a mission, meaning no progress is made towards unlocking the next quality tier for that weapon despite a successful run. Various classes and weapons still have useless (or borderline useless) perks, some of which can outright kill a player. The netcode has improved, but random disconnects are still a thing. Players on both AMD and nVidia cards have reported crashes at various times in the game's life cycle: at launch, AMD cards were having issues, but recently it seems to be nVidia users getting the short end of the stick. There's also the issue where if you're joined with a group via matchmaking and your preferred class is already being used, you're forced to pick another class (without an accompanying opportunity to make sure you've got an appropriate weapon load out for the map you're playing).

I'm having a good time with this game, obviously -- the number of hours I've played is plainly visible here. But I can only recommend this game with caveats. If you love 40k, like co-op PvE games, and don't mind dropping 60 bones on a game that's light on content, grab it. You'll have fun, and you can certainly squeeze plenty of hours out of repeating the Operations missions. I have.

If all three of those descriptors don't fit you though...wait for a sale. Just wait. I can easily see people getting a case of buyer's remorse buying this at 60. In all honesty, I'd recommend you wait even if those DO describe you. There's a good game here, but I can't say it's completely worth the price of admission right now. I don't exactly have buyer's remorse myself, but neither am I glad I spent that money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been wanting to play a sequel to Space Marine since the first game launched in 2011. To finally be able to play the sequel to it was fantastic! I love everything about Space Marines and the game in general so I bought the Ultra Edition of the game instantly so nothing would be spoiled for me via the internet.

Was the wait for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 worth it? Is it a good game? Is it a worthy successor to Space Marine (1)? Yes. Yes it was and I am glad I paid to play early because I loved and still am, currently loving everything about the game. Below I will explain why I am loving Space Marine 2 but first, a quick disclaimer!

This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on.

âš«In terms of optimisation - the game has no lag, stutter, fps drops, freezing e.t.c. Space Marine 2 is technically not out yet as of writing this review (paid to play early) and the game runs smoother than butter. Is this because Denuvo DRM is not on the game? Probably.
âš«The visuals/Graphic are beyond AMAZING and even on low specs, they look stunning.
âš«Fighting off the THOUSANDS of Tyranids that are coming to turn you into a bloody gore pit on the floor was PHENOMENAL. Watching them make the ""pyramid"" to climb up the walls and you punch, shoot, crush, stomp - OBLITERATE them from the face of the planet... the gore, the blood, the animations... all of which are so spot on.
âš«The game has a LORE-ACCURATE art direction which ANY 40k fan will respect and to top that off the lore is accurate and faithful to true canon lore. Compared to some ""recent"" 40k games - Space Marine 2 is the BEST Warhammer game to be released in over a decade.
âš«The combat system is stellar. Ranging from melee weapons to ranged weapons that work so fluently together in the heat of battle. Doing the melee combos to stun and then being able to point your gun - executioner style to kill them... felt so good.
âš«Enemy variety will keep you on your toes almost at all times. Not only are they ""unique"" they all have their own behaviours and abilities which will put your skills to the test of a true Space Marine.
âš«On harder difficulties the enemies seem to dynamically change their movesets (either this is true or I suck on veteran+) and, I am not kidding here, will TRULY test your skills. Harder difficulty campaign (or ops) will be a true test of player skill as you need to perfect your dodging and parrying ability because in the end - this show the true lethality of mankind's enemies in the 40k universe.
âš«The story was very well written and I enjoyed it from start to finish. It had interesting moments, moments where you would be like ""oh no"" or ""FOR THE OMNISIAH!!!"". Not only that, the characters were very well embedded in the story which only enhanced the story even more.
âš«Once you are finished with campaign missions you can play the OPERATIONS MODE (PVE) which run parallel to the base games campaign which has you playing as a different ultramarine squad that lets you level up weapons and several class's. Not only is this mode FANTASTIC, the progression feels rewarding as the longer you go, the harder it gets and more XP you will earn, ontop of that you will earn UNIQUE cosmetics that other players may or may not be able to obtain (as I said, skill based combat).
âš«If PVE mode is not your thing, don't fret! You also gain access to ENDLESS WAR (PVP) which pits Space Marines against the Chaos forces. It brings back the classic game modes such as Deathmatch which I am sure we all know how fun that was in Space Marine! Not only that, if you are struggling to get perks and weapons unlocked in PVP you can just go play PVE for a bit as PVP shares PVE's loadout customisation options.
âš«It has tonnes of content still yet to be released - look at the roadmap. Horde mode.... come on, who doesn't just want to sit and kill thousands, if not millions, of Tyranids for the Emperors name!

âš«The main issue that people are mentioning is the ""servers"" struggling at the moment - I have noticed this issue only seems to happen if you are playing COOP campaign or ONLINE modes - You can spend about 5-10 minutes on the ""loading"" screen to only realise that the game is not loading at all and this forces you to restart your game. If you are in Campaign, you will most likely loose all mission progress if you are the COOP partner or miss an important cutscene. This means you might have to replay the mission you had just played.
âš«You cannot order your AI team to do anything. Open a door. Press a button. Heal you. They are a bit ""stupid"" to say the least. Hey, no games perfect.
âš«There are no collectables or ""secrets"" to be found. Only Dataslates. I am mentioning this in cons because I feel like they missed a golden opportunity to add little secrets about ""past"" events or ""past"" games that have released.
âš«About the point above - there is no point in really exploring as there is nothing to see or find. Just the dataslates and even at that they are not really hidden at all. The maps were very linear full of dead-ends, wished there was a little more ""exploring"" to be had.

In the end, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is probably the best Warhammer game in a decade. Not only is it faithful to it's lore, it had practically no stutter, lag, fps drops at all, the animations are spot on, the characters are spot on, the world building and story writing were superb... this is what Warhammer should be like when you make it a game!!!

I wholeheartedly, after waiting almost 14/15 years for a new Space Marine game to come out... say this game should be played by everyone, new or old to the 40K universe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Como fan de Warhammer 40K no puedo estar mas contento de verdad. Es un juego increÃ­ble y parece literalmente que estas viviendo una pelicula.

Cosas buenas:


- Los graficos son de 10, me repito, parece una pelicula.

- Fidelidad absoluta a la franquicia

- Jugabilidad y mecanicas


Malas:

- Hay perdida de frames y un uso de CPU elevado que se va a corregir en parches, asi que no es un problema.

- Los colores del pintaejercitos debarian ser gratuitos. No puedo crear a mi capitulo porque el azul que necesito es de DLC. Creo que lo unico de pago debaria ser cosmetico a nivel armadura sin restringir los colores.

- Algunos colores no quedan bien pintados segun que zonas porque el tono no coincide con el color.

- Rangos DLC. Para crear a los tenientes y a los sargentos veteranos necesitas tambien el patron de DLC y no parece justo tampoco. (Me comprare el DLC mas adelante de todas formas)



Cosas que yo meterÃ­a en el multijugador:


- Que cuando personalices a tu marine los colores aplicados sean tambien aplicados al resto de toda la flota para que de esa forma si tienes un capitulo propio sientas esa inmersiÃ³n.

- El modo PVP deberÃ­a tener un PVE tambien desde mi punto de vista porque yo y todos mis amigos somos jugadores PVE. (Esto no es necesario pero si habria mas gente casual que simplemente quiere pasar un buen rato con sus amigos)

Por lo general no escribo reseÃ±as pero este juego lo merece porque es de 10/10

ğŸŸ§ Space Marine 2 sold 4.5 million copies, instead of addressing simple stuff like server connection issues, launch issues and QoL changes. Game devs wanted to 90% focus on nerfing fun gameplay you enjoy in PvE Operations with friends


ğŸ”¸ Still have enemy damage sponges that deal high health damage in higher difficulties you see in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Odyssey, forcing you to level up your class to the max level and play like Sekiro and Wo Long Fallen Dynasty (parry heavy games).

ğŸ”¸ Lethal difficulty forces your Classes to really stick together counter-intuitive to the role of Sniper, Vanguard and Assault (they need positioning and at times far from teammates).

ğŸ”¸ Lethal difficulty last brother standing (if your 2 teammates are down) won't let you have a redemption arc cause you cannot gain armor when both of your teammates are down.


ğŸ”¸ For some reason in higher difficulties like Ruthless and Lethal, PvE Operations Space Marines that come from the Battle Barge with so many supplies then get transported by the Thunderhawk to a planet, cannot even bring 1 Medicae Stimms with them.

ğŸ”¸ You cannot choose a grenade type in the Battle Barge before being deployed in PvE Operations even in higher levels but in PvP you can choose a grenade type (when you level up).

ğŸ”¸ For some reason, very simple stuff like changing Helmet Lens Colors and Bulwark Flag Banner is extremely hard to do for them.


ğŸ”¸ No weapons holstered or sheathed on the hip like the Chainsword you see in early trailers of Space Marine 2. Weapons disappear to thin air while doing executions like what you see in FromSoftware games when you open doors there (play Mandragora demo and see how that game lets you sheathe weapons while climbing).

ğŸ”¸ Wants you to register to the Focus website to voice out concerns and ideas, many nice highly upvoted ideas and concerns there are 95% ignored.

ğŸ”¸ Always changing Armor Colors, now you lose some of those colors and some colors still don't match when applied to a different armor part even if they are the same color.


ğŸ”¸ Parry mechanics change: Fencing parry feels weird now and samish to Balanced. Contested health still disappears so fast, add 1 to 2 secs delay before deterioration. Can't get that health back being staggered, interrupted and busy parrying.

ğŸ”¸ Same weapons just different bad stats like very slow attack speed, I read that Space Marines are supposed to be fast why are they so slow? Enemies move and dodge faster.

ğŸ”¸ So many bad perks that are useless in higher difficulty, makes you choose a select few that are viable. 5% damage increase? 3% heal when you execute an Extremis? Choose a perk between 10% damage for the Tyranids and Chaos?


ğŸ”¸ For some reason you get staggered and interrupted a lot even with the perks ""do not lose control while charging an attack"" and ""after being grabbed, not lose control when taking heavy hits""

ğŸ”¸ Assault Class loses the ability to fly-hover, air-dash, shoot and drop grenades while flying in PvE Operations (play an Assault Class in PvP Eternal War you will know what I am talking about, when you high jump, tap the ability again to air hover).

ğŸ”¸Assault Class eats 1 charge of the Jump Pack when you Dash with it instead of half a charge, Jump Pack is actually used twice during Ground and Pound (once during lift and used again during ground smash) but eats only 1 charge.


ğŸ”¸ Vanguard Class loses the ability to grapple environments in PvE Operations (play a Vanguard in PvP Eternal War and you can grapple to walls, windows and ground).

ğŸ”¸ Very limited pistol choices for the Sniper, Vanguard and Assault Classes.

ğŸ”¸ No shield charge for the Bulwark class, even Fortnite has Captain America's shield charge.


ğŸ”¸ Grindfest MMO and Mobile leveling style for each class, there are 6 classes, you have to replay PvP and PvE countless times

ğŸ”¸ Their idea of padding up gameplay is grinding the same map over and over again. The Tyranid Hierophant Bio-Titan has a smoke screen but the Space Marines do not have a smoke grenade to lose enemy aggro so you can revive a teammate and range enemies to lose accuracy when you are inside the smoke?

ğŸ”¸ Saber Interactive didn't really level up and evolve their talent/perk design coming from their previous game World War Z. Play other games like Dota 2, Hades 1 and 2, Astral Ascent, Ember Knights, etc. to get really good ideas for the Perks system, yours are still the boring, uninnovative, useless in high difficulty perks.




â˜„ï¸ Make Perks actually great that change gameplay in PvE Operations like the Assault Class we enjoy in PvP Eternal War, have him choose among:

ğŸ”¹ Ground Pound Assault Class (what we have now).

ğŸ”¹ Fly-Hover Assault (in PvP Eternal War the Assault Class can fly, hover and dash in the air, shoot his pistol and even throw grenades mid-air). For some ugly reason they won't let you do this in PvE Operations. Air Assault Class.

ğŸ”¹ Jump Pack Dash-Dodge Assault (does not have to be a perfect dodge, jump pack dash eats half a charge and replenishes fast (you can still hover and dash mid-air but don't have damage perks for Ground Pound and Fly Hover). Dash Mobility Evasion Assault Class.


â˜„ï¸ Perks change for the Vanguard Class, let him choose among:

ğŸ”¹ Perks that focus on Grappling Enemies (what we have now). Sekiro and Spiderman web zip Vanguard.

ğŸ”¹ Perks that focus on Grappling Environments (walls and ground) for mobility (fast cooldown) what you see in PvP Eternal Vanguard. Escape and Close-In distance fast Vanguard.

ğŸ”¹ Perks that focus on Parry and Melee combat (you already have some of these perks with the Vanguard Class). Lies of P and Bloodborne Vanguard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 Ã© uma obra prima dos TPS

Uau, Ã© realmente chocante e triste o quÃ£o banal se tornaram os motivos para se negativar um jogo em anÃ¡lises. Simplesmente estÃ£o colocando nota negativa Ã  um jogo praticamente sem defeitos em tudo que ele se propÃµe a ser por causa de ""continha na Epic"", que nem mesmo Ã© obrigatÃ³ria para se jogar o jogo, vocÃª pode simplesmente ignorar e desinstalar, tirando o crossplay entre as plataformas... Mas enfim, vamos Ã  minha anÃ¡lise:


Essa frase define a estÃ©tica e energia que carrega o universo Warhammer 40k. O universo nos leva Ã  um futuro distante onde a humanidade, apÃ³s quase fracassar como espÃ©cie, obteve a ajuda de um humano especial conhecido apenas como ""Imperador da Humanidade"" e pÃ´de comeÃ§ar a se reerguer e recuperar um pouco de tecnologia ancestral para dar inÃ­cio aos seus feitos de conquista, conquista essa NECESSÃRIA, pois a galÃ¡xia Ã© uma floresta negra impiedosa onde outras espÃ©cies, chamadas de Xenos pelos humanos, estÃ£o em busca de domÃ­nio e garantia de sobrevivÃªncia. No entanto, o Imperador caiu, traÃ­do na Heresia de Horus, e agora, no milÃªnio 41, o que resta Ã© apenas a esperanÃ§a de poucos Adeptus Astartes que ainda conseguem sonhar com um futuro para esse impÃ©rio decadente...
Toda essa ideia de um universo ""grim dark"" que sempre esteve presente em WH40K desde sua concepÃ§Ã£o Ã© muito bem traduzida dentro do jogo, com sua ambientaÃ§Ã£o grandiosa e ao mesmo tempo efÃªmera, com construÃ§Ãµes gigantescas que mais parecem relÃ­quias de um passado uma vez majestoso, do que algo para se orgulhar nos dias dos milÃªnio 41. O roteiro tambÃ©m passa bem essa ideia por meio de diÃ¡logos e situaÃ§Ãµes que induzem ansiedade e desesperado pelos olhos dos humanos comuns e atÃ© mesmo dos Astartes, pois eles nÃ£o conhecem nada alÃ©m da luta, e nÃ£o sabem se um dia conhecerÃ£o a paz. Como diz mesmo o voto dos Ultramarines, ""Meu voto, Ã© serviÃ§o eterno"".


A gameplay de Space Marine 2 Ã© uma clara evoluÃ§Ã£o de tudo que jÃ¡ havia no Space Marine 2, com muito mais conteÃºdo e complexidade envolvida. Aos olhos de alguÃ©m que vÃ¡ jogar em dificuldades menores, talvez pareÃ§a bobo, mas se o jogador se empenhar e entender as mecÃ¢nicas para jogar nas dificuldades mais altas, este verÃ¡ que funciona como uma danÃ§a no campo de batalha. Ã‰ preciso diminuir o nÃºmero dos inimigos menores, conseguir se distanciar desses para eliminar alguns que atiram de longe, entÃ£o ter free hit para atacar corpo a corpo contra Tyranids brutos, executar esses com execuÃ§Ãµes gloriosas parecidas com as de Doom 2016 para recuperar armadura e se manter lutando por mais tempo, dar parries perfeitos para dar um tiro crÃ­tico e ganhar momentum na batalha, assim como esquivas perfeitas ou esquivas para meramente se distancias do perigo e recarregar. HÃ¡ muita complexidade envolvida e nÃ£o se trata apenas de correr e atirar. Sem falar na variedade de armas e seus usos para cada situaÃ§Ã£o especÃ­fica, assim como as diferentes granadas e habilidades tÃ¡ticas.
A gameplay aqui Ã© o FOCO principal, como deve ser em um bom jogo de verdade (pelo menos para mim), e o jogo nÃ£o possui problemas de ritmo e em nenhum momento perde a magia, assim como (citando mais uma vez) Doom 2016 e Doom Eternal, onde ao invÃ©s das coisas ficarem repetitivas pela aÃ§Ã£o extrema, elas ficam ainda melhores pelo aumento da intensidade gradativa, com mais momentos onde a escolha e atitude rÃ¡pida do jogador vÃ£o fazer a diferenÃ§a. O jogo pode ser desafiador em dados momentos, mas se vc entrar no mindset de um space marine e a forÃ§a imparÃ¡vel que vc representa com estratÃ©gia e atitude, vocÃª escaparÃ¡ de qualquer situaÃ§Ã£o, atÃ© mesmo de primeira nas maiores dificuldades, basta se encontrar dentro do jogo, e Ã© isso que Ã© tÃ£o incrÃ­vel dentro da gameplay desse novo Space Marine. No entanto, isso nÃ£o quer dizer que a histÃ³ria nÃ£o seja boa.


Mesmo com a gameplay sendo o foco aqui, nÃ£o quer dizer que a histÃ³ria nÃ£o seja boa, na verdade ela Ã© muito boa, e Ã© contada como os antigos faziam, por meio de boas cutscenes que aparecem do nada e conteÃºdos extra kkkkkkkkk. O universo 40k Ã© rico em MUITA LORE, afinal de contas sÃ£o quase 40 anos de existÃªncia, com milhares de coisas nos wargames e tabuleiro, nos livros dos RPG de mesa, mais de 500 livros e histÃ³rias, animaÃ§Ãµes, quadrinhos, enfim, Ã© coisa para caralho. Mas o jogo ele faz bem em condensar a histÃ³ria para um contexto especÃ­fico e se manter nesse contexto.
O jogo comeÃ§a no mundo de Kadaku, um Hive World que estÃ¡ sendo atacado pela recente raÃ§a de xenos Tyranids que chegaram na galÃ¡xia, de origem desconhecida. SÃ£o como insetos poderosos de rÃ¡pida adaptÃ§Ã£o e evoluÃ§Ã£o que agem sob um poderoso consciente coletivo chamado de Mente Colmeia, ou Hive Mind. Eles sÃ£o inteligentes, miram e atacam em pontos estratÃ©gicos e nÃ£o temem morrer para concluir objetivos essenciais, sÃ£o basicamente uma forÃ§a implacÃ¡vel, sem ambiÃ§Ã£o ou emoÃ§Ãµes para atrapalhar, o Ãºnico objetivo Ã© consumir tudo no universo. E a partir daÃ­ entra em cena nosso protagonista Titus, que retorna depois de ter entrado em contato com um artefato de Caos (outra forÃ§a do universo) e ser marcado pelos inquisidores, sendo enviado para a Deathwatch para lutar contra Xenos em diversos sistemas. No entanto, apÃ³s uma gloriosa e importante vitÃ³ria, Marneus Calgar ordenou o mesmo Ã  voltar para os Ultramarines e lutar novamente por Ultramar! DaÃ­ a histÃ³ria se desenrola com diversos twists envolvendo Astartes traidores corrompidos pelas forÃ§as do Chaos, reviravoltas de personagens interessantes, e claro, muita sanguinolÃªncia e vingaÃ§a. Tenho certeza que a histÃ³ria do jogo irÃ¡ empolgar muitos jogadores e inspirar vÃ¡rios deles a irem atrÃ¡s de conhecer o universo e de repente serem floodados por shorts de lore em todas as redes sociais.


Como vivemos em uma era onde todo mundo estÃ¡ viciado em microdoses de dopamina, e somos todos fodidos da cabeÃ§a buscando alguma espÃ©cie de amparo em qualquer tipinho de conteÃºdo, apenas uma boa campanha nÃ£o basta... Sempre querem mais :rottenwalker: . EntÃ£o Ã©, o jogo tem multiplayer e promessas de conteÃºdo novo Ã  cada season para uma maior longevidade, onde teremos conteÃºdos relacionados a outros CapÃ­tulos de Space Marines, armas novas, inimigos, mapas handcrafted (nada procedural, amÃ©m), e muitas e muitas skins para os fÃ£s fanÃ¡ticos colecionarem. Mas de que se trata esse multiplayuer? Existe o multiplayer da campanha, onde vc pode jogar com mais 2 amigos para completÃ¡-la, e hÃ¡ ainda o modo coop de OperaÃ§Ãµes, onde vocÃª escolhe uma entre as 6 classes disponÃ­veis para completar missÃµes difÃ­ceis no bom e velho estilo de Left 4 Dead 2, com muitas hordas chegando, e objetivos para se completar enquanto isso. HÃ¡ o estÃ­mulo da repetiÃ§Ã£o por meio de lvl ups das armas e das classes, com perks para desbloquear e melhorias de armadura por meio de coletÃ¡veis de nodos de armaduras e sementes genÃ©ticas. AlÃ©m do modo de operaÃ§Ãµes hÃ¡ ainda o pvp, que na minha opiniÃ£o Ã© muito bem vindo e me lembrou bastante a era de ouro dos videogames, lembrando especificamente o multiplayer de Halo. HÃ¡ planos para a vinda de um modo de Horda.



Para fechar essa anÃ¡lise, devo dizer que de fato o jogo Ã© incrÃ­vel, para mim Ã© como um suspiro em uma indÃºstria cada vez pior, com tÃ­tulos onde o que importa de verdade nos jogos Ã© deixado de lado, e onde mecÃ¢nicas simples e o convencionalismo estÃ¡ vencendo para agradar pessoas com ""arte em pÃ­lula"", pois essas pessoas estÃ£o doentes e cansadas. Ã‰ um jogo que parece que foi feito em 2010 com grÃ¡ficos e parÃ¢metros de resposta na gameplay dos dias de hoje, que respeita MUITO o material original e sabe o que seus fÃ£s querem ver em uma obra. ParabÃ©ns Saber Interactive por fazer o que estÃºdios maiores nÃ£o estÃ£o dispostos a fazer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm sure this is a great game, but it's literally unplayable for me right now. My computer is well within the game's required specs, but within less than an hour, I had consistent issues with:

- Texture streaming. Textures sometimes simply wouldn't load, leaving the game a fuzzy mess
- Audio steaming. Music tracks stuttered, audio cut out during dialogue in missions
- Enemy lag. Somehow, in a single-player intro mission, Xenos were teleporting around as if I had connection issues
- Objects disappearing. Ammo crates, med kits just disappeared on interaction for some reason
- No ultrawide support. That's more a personal preference thing, but still

I'm happy for the people able to enjoy this game. Hopefully they address some of the blatant technical issues the game is facing eventually. Will look to try pick this up again in future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DespuÃ©s de 28 horas de juego (solo dedicadas a la campaÃ±a en la dificultad final) sin duda puedo decir que es un buen juego, no solo por el apartado grÃ¡fico y su historia sino tambiÃ©n por la sencillez del juego, no busca marear a los jugadores solo presentar un combate desafiante y una historia centrada.

Loved the first game. This sequel is straight up not enjoyable. The levels are designed around 3 players; if you're playing single player than the AI is absolutely useless. They don't play the objective, they don't prioritize targets, they just run around near you and stab random enemies. If a game is going to force you to use AI teammates, they better be able to pull their own weight.

Multiplayer is somewhat fun, but even that falls short. Game play feels very similar to Halo Infinite, except slower, clunkier, and not as much fun. Also, Halo is free and this is full price.

I played this for four hours before coming to the conclusion that it just isn't fun enough to keep playing. Which is a shame, because if I'd stopped before two hours I could have refunded it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8/10. Combat is extremely fun and engaging, PvP feels way more balanced than I initially expected, the game looks beautiful, and mostly runs great. Feels extremely accurate to the lore, the customization options are insane. The negatives are really just long load times, and while we know we're getting more operations and such, eventually running the same 6 will get a bit stale. However, the higher the difficulty, the more random encounters can happen, and makes the game more exciting, even when doing the same thing over and over. Finished the campaign 2 days ago, been in operations and pvp ever since. Love it here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arcvox,Recommended,24.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/arcvox/,"Posted: September 17
Space Marine 2 is an excellent sequel to the original, improving on the original game in almost every aspect. As it currently stands, I think it's a great game and represents the 40K universe very well, capturing grand scale combat zones on gorgeous alien planets. That said, it can certainly do with some quality of life improvements, which is to be expected of most new games out the gate. Hopefully they will address certain issues quite quickly, though most of these didn't affect the game in a negative way. More details on that below.

The game itself follows the story from the first game, which was a fairly basic story about the discovery of a relic which brings about nothing but trouble for the protagonist, Titus. Essentially, he is paying penance for his ""crime"" in the last game, which consists of him not dying. As a result of this, he has grown distrustful of his fellow brothers, which in turn makes his brothers not trust him - along with the obvious fact that he mysteriously vanished for the last couple of centuries. The campaign takes place over 3 planets, while certain storyline events take place concurrently with the Operations game mode, which is essentially another 6 missions in co-op mode, where you can play as a custom Space Marine.

The gameplay is pretty basic. It's very similar to Gears of War without the cover system, instead relying on stunning and executing enemies to restore your overshields. You'll be mixing up melee and gun play mopping up large numbers of basic enemies while eliminating the larger threats, which mostly consist of two large factions each with around 6-7 enemy types each, and some boss type enemies too.

Overall, I do recommend this game, however I do feel that the amount of content itself is a little bit lacking. Saber have made a very good game platform for more content to be added, and I can imagine different scenarios and missions could easily be added to objective mode. Having completed the campaign, it definitely feels as though it's meant to be played co-op too, especially with all the cool cosmetics you can unlock in the multiplayer modes. These additions I feel like would be low effort for the developer, so maybe they will consider it in the future.

Other than the small quality of life improvements and a bit of tweaking on some of the multiplayer classes, I think Saber did an excellent job, and I look forward to more content. The storyline is gripping, the visuals are amazing, and it's the sort of fun gory gameplay that we used to get a lot of in gaming, so it's nice to have a callback to that.


- Excellent visuals that brings the 40K universe to life in an authentic way.
- Captures the essence of the Space Marines in all their glory (though on harder difficulties you won't feel very powerful at all)
- Impressive horde mechanics, particularly in their movement. Climbing up walls and scrambling over each other suits the tyranids amazingly.
- Combat is fairly basic but fun, and glory killing enemies never seems to get old.


- Gaining multiplayer XP is incredibly slow, given that you'll be repeating online content a fair bit. This is exacerbated by the fact that cosmetics use the same currency as productive upgrades such as perk points. I feel like the two should have been separated so you can work towards your favorite chapter AND progress in abilities so you can pull your weight better in teams.
- Melee in particular needs some buffs, as it tends to do little damage compared to firearms.
- Harder difficulties are quite overtuned at the moment. This is especially apparent against ranged enemies, who always seem to have a clear line of sight to your team and make extremely quick work of you while in combat.
- Missing some obvious and easy to implement quality of life improvements, such as a co-op campaign mode, customisable campaign armor sets using cosmetics from the multiplayer, and weapons carrying over from certain chapters. I noticed in the campaign, Titus regularly has his default armor and weapons, which is understandable in CGI cutscenes, but not in the in-game ones. Also, I would have preferred to have the helmets on the team for the custscenes too. There is an option for this, but it only affects gameplay moments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction

I always wanted to make my own space marine, color it, choose the chapter i want, play with but getting into the 40k Mini's is hard and expensive. But with this game you can immerse yourself in the world of 40k and be a Space Marine for US$60.

Regardless whether you're into 40K or not, if you like 3rd person shooter, fighting xenos (aliens) with 2 other people, that has a good Story Campaign, 6 different classes in Pve Operations mode, and a PVP, then this game is for you

Pros and Cons
(Pros) Immersive and great campaign mode that delves into the 40K universe (especially Ultramarines Chapter which is 40k Warhammer golden boy). (Cons) The campaign is quite short, which is less then 15 hours





So in conclusion, think it's a great game and a lot of fun to play with friends or random. This game had been a blast compared to some of the 40K games released before this, and it lives up to the first Space Marine. Whether or not this game is worth it for those who want to buy it, is up to you. After reading all the pros and cons, reading review, taking it all to consideration, is it worth your time and money? only you can decide :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Der Imperator ist enttÃ¤uscht..

Ich war ein groÃŸer Fan des ersten Space Marine Teil entgegen der negativen Kritiken die es damals hagelte! Insofern war meine Freude das es eine Fortsetzung gibt sehr hoch! Leider kann ich diesem Spiel dennoch keine gute Bewertung dalassen!
Es liegt weder an der Technik noch der AtmosphÃ¤re, das ist soweit Top und macht optisch wirklich etwas her. Die Beleuchtung, die riesigen SchwÃ¤rme , die Kulisse, alles sehr schick..ABER...

Diese Spiel schwÃ¤chelt meiner Meinung nach am Kampfsystem, und das , wo es doch ein Action Game sein soll...
Der gesamte Kampf wirkt einfach extrem ""schwammig"". Man prÃ¼gelt wie wild, ohne jeden Sinn und Verstand drauf los. Treffer hagelt es von allen Seiten so das mann zeitweise nichts anderes tun kann auÃŸer permanent die Leertaste zu spammen. Man hat zu keiner Zeit das GefÃ¼hl irgendwie wirklich Einfluss auf den Kampf zu haben ob man nun gut oder schlecht spielt! Es hagelt einen Treffer nach dem anderen und es gibt eigentlich nichts was man dagegen tun kÃ¶nnte. Gelegentlich, wenn man es denn in dem ganzen Gewusel mitbekommt, kann man mal einen Block raushauen. Hier wirkt das ganze dann auch wuchtig, geht jedoch in dem ganzen durcheinander vÃ¶llig unter.
Ich habe es auf Schwer und Leicht gespielt, und vÃ¶llig Wurst ob man sich gut oder schlecht anstellt...irgendwie kommt man schon durch! Das erfordert keinerlei KÃ¶nnen oder Raffinesse sonder ist schlichtes TastengehÃ¤mmere!

Beim ersten Teil war auch ordentlich was los auf den Schlachtfeldern, aber wenn ich hier meine Attacken und Finisher gut getimt habe, hatt ich Einfluss darauf wie sich der Kampf entwickelt! KÃ¤mpfte ich schnell, nutzte BetÃ¤ubungsschlÃ¤ge konnte ich lÃ¤nger im Kampf bestehen und letzten Endes den Kampf fÃ¼r mich entscheiden!

Hier ist es vÃ¶llig egal wie ich kÃ¤mpfe, die Treffer kassiere ich so oder so, dann gibt es alle paar Sekunden mal eine Konterattacke und einen Finisher der sich jedoch extrem schnell abnutzt. Diese Konter sind auch das einzige was man wirklich in der Hand hat. 95% der Treffer kassiert man trotzdem ob man nun geschickt ausweicht oder nicht und am Ende kommt man dann so oder so durch den Kampf ohne eigentlich zu wissen wie!

Die KÃ¤mpfe sind schlicht viel zu unÃ¼bersichtlich und man haut einfach wild drauf los mit immer und immer und immer......und immer den selben stumpfen Attacken! Wenn man sich einem grÃ¶ÃŸeren Gegner stellt wird man in der Zeit hundert mal von hinten getroffen von Hormaganten die einfach stumpf an deiner Figur ""kleben"" .Die stehen einfach dumm da und man verliert Leben und RÃ¼stung ohne etwas dagegen unternehmen zu kÃ¶nnen !
Die SchlÃ¤ge sind extrem unprÃ¤zise und gehen allzu oft ins Leere. Der Marine stapft dabei einfach schwerfÃ¤llig vorwÃ¤rts und haut ein und dieselbe Kombo nach der anderen raus .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C'est bien, une bonne suite au premier mais sa manque quand mÃªme de contenu, quelques armes en plus, avec plus d'opÃ©rations et de maps PvP Ã§a n'aurait pas Ã©tÃ© de trop (mÃªme si il vont en rajouter au fil du temps 6 maps opÃ©ration et 3 maps PvP Ã  la sortie c'est peu).

Autre point nÃ©gatif pour moi, pour avoir pas mal jouÃ© les missions PvE Ã  la plus haute difficultÃ©, le choix de design de rendre les ennemis des Ã©ponges Ã  balles quand on monte la difficultÃ© c'est vraiment nul, ils ne sont pas forcÃ©ment plus nombreux (un peu plus de monstres extrÃ©mis) mais par contre on a beau avoir des armes niveaux max on a l'impression qu'on tire avec des nerfs. J'aurais prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© des mobs un peu moins tanky mais plus nombreux.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(partiellement rÃ©glÃ©e Ã  la 4.1) 1Ã¨re grosse erreur : nerf des munitions. Ils ont buff plusieurs armes depuis le patch 4.1, les valeurs n'ont pas l'air bien Ã©levÃ©es. en revanche les munitions sont toujours limitÃ©es dans les caches de munitions pour les grosses difficultÃ©s, c'est trop pÃ©nalisant pour l'une des classes qui ne possÃ¨de pas de corp Ã  corp. pour ma part c'est juste pour rendre la difficultÃ© chiante , et non difficile,Ã  vous de juger.

(toujours prÃ©sent Ã  la 4.1) 2Ã¨me grosse erreur : le nerf d'armure dans les difficultÃ©s supÃ©rieures, lÃ  c'est costaud, on prenais dÃ©jÃ  globalement plus de dÃ©gÃ¢ts dÃ» au nombre d'ennemi qui augmente, et dans certains cas on se faisait dÃ©jÃ  explosÃ© comme il faut,mÃªme en ayant les bons rÃ©flexes. A la derniÃ¨re difficultÃ©, c'est complÃ¨tement lunaire, on devient une vraie chips, je vois mÃªme lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt, on prend cher mÃªme en se dÃ©fendant bien, on est pas ""rÃ©compenser"" par le jeu en jouant bien, ca ne sert strictement Ã  rien, c'est juste frustrant

(rÃ©glÃ©e Ã  la 4.1) 3Ã©me grosse erreur : la mÃ©canique d'escouade (rÃ©glÃ©e)

(parait rÃ©glÃ©e Ã  la 4.1) autres erreurs : flood dâ€™ennemis puissant (plusieurs extremis)

Ils ont corrigÃ© quelques trucs Ã  la 4.1, mais ce n'est toujours pas aussi bien qu'avant le patch 4 de ce que j'ai vu pour l'instant. ils n'ont pas fait comme ARROWHEAD avec helldivers 2 c'est dÃ©jÃ  Ã§a, mais je ne pense pas que tout est encore bien rÃ©glÃ©. Je ne m'amuse toujours pas comme l'avant patch 4, je dirais bien que c'est surtout parceque les joueurs moyens ne peuvent plus faire de T4 sans constamment devoir Ãªtre assistÃ©, c'est surtout ce qui rend mes parties chiantes parce quâ€™il faut constamment PL les nuls",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meus amigos(a) cai nesse jogo de para-quedas, apenas olhando alguns vÃ­deos no youtube e acabei me interessando por ele, nÃ£o joguei o primeiro jogo da sÃ©rie, nao estou familiarizado com a histÃ³ria do jogo mas estou simplesmente apaixonado por esse game. Que jogo gostoso de jogar ainda mais com um dualsense vc sente o controle a cada passo que vocÃª da, as armas, as finalizaÃ§Ãµes, os gatilhos Ã© surreal uma carnificina total, e o mais legal Ã© que temos muniÃ§Ã£o avonts pelo menos nesse comeÃ§o, nao tive problemas em achar muniÃ§Ã£o pelo cenÃ¡rio!!! Super recomendo o jogo se vocÃª tiver uma grana sobrando e estiver a procura de diversÃ£o, agora se nÃ£o tiver jÃ¡ aconselho a colocar ele na sua lista de desejo e aguardar uma promoÃ§Ã£o porque vale a pena dar uma chance mesmo que nao tenha jogado o 1Â° jogo como eu, bom atÃ© o momento sem palavras pois gostei demais do que joguei, tipo do jogo sem muita frescura de exploraÃ§Ã£o nem coisa do gÃªnero, negÃ³cio Ã© descer a bala e triturar as criaturas com uma arma branca, uma sensaÃ§Ã£o espetacular!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review is based on a review copy played on both PC and Steam Deck.

Overview
(In-depth analysis below)
Space Marine 2 is an exhilarating sequel that nails fast-paced hybrid combat, mixing ranged and close-quarters as you take on endless hordes of Tyranids. With a massive selection of weapons and gameplay mechanics, each encounter feels not only unique but incredibly intense and satisfying. Despite some optimization hiccups, it is still an incredible journey through the dark and gritty Warhammer 40k universe. Whether a long-time fan or new to the franchise, there is plenty to enjoy.

Positives Negatives
















The story picks up one century after the first installment. Titus now leads a squad of Ultramarines in a relentless battle against the Tyranids, a deadly alien swarm threatening humanity. However, Titus' return is clouded by suspicionâ€”once accused of Chaos corruption, his every decision is scrutinized, and trust in his leadership is shaky at best. But as the Tyranid menace grows, survival demands action, leaving little room for doubt or hesitation.

The narrative intertwines high-stakes action with personal drama, as the urgent need to confront a devastating foe clashes with the lingering mistrust surrounding Titus' past. This completes a compelling tale of exoneration, loyalty, and relentless warfare, absorbing you in the adrenaline of battle and the depth of Titus' journey.


SM2 builds on Saber Interactive's signature horde mechanics from World War Z, refining the formula to fit within the chaotic, action-packed Warhammer 40k universe.
The extensive arsenal of weapons offers diverse gameplay mechanics that can alter your playstyle significantly, capturing the visceral intensity of 40k battles with brutal executions and massive gunfights against swarms of enemies. Though a few quirky design choices from WWZ persist, like the absence of jumping, long button presses for actions, and lackluster AI companions that cannot be adjusted, these qualms of mine are minor in the bigger picture. The overall experience remains highly engaging, fluid, and, most importantly, fun.

Each Tyranid has unique abilities and attack patterns, meaning you cannot just rely on the same strategy for every encounter; you'll need to adapt your approach as new threats are introduced. This keeps the horde mechanics fresh with increasingly complex enemy variations. Boss fights are particularly thrilling, often demanding quick thinking and precise movement, and are a welcome change of pace.

Mobility plays a crucial role, and much like weaponry and combat, it feels fantastic. You can sense the weight of the hefty armor, making traversal satisfyingâ€”especially when utilizing mobility-orientated abilities like the jetpack. However, the absence of a cover system or the mere ability to jump forces you to rely on frantic dodge-rolling and the riposte mechanic to avoid being overwhelmed amidst the hordes you face; while fun at first it can become quite repetitive.


Alongside the already impressive campaign, additional game modes are available at your leisure that can be enjoyed alone or with your fellow brothers. The Operations mode offers supplementary missions set between the campaign events, where you can choose from six classes, each with unique playstyles, loadouts, and abilities. Completing Operations rewards you with XP, unlocking new weapons, class, and weaponry upgrades, and the ability to customize your Space Marine. Lastly, Eternal War presents a 6v6 multiplayer mode where you can test your skills against others in the name of the Emperor if a competitive thrill is what you desire.

Altogether, SM2 offers a wealth of content, from raw content alone and experimentation across different classes and weapons extending replayability, with a solid sense of progression and customization. Plus, Saber has already released a robust roadmap, promising even more future content, both free and paid.



The environments span towering Gothic cathedrals and industrial wastelands to the desolate expanse of space, each grand in size and detail. The battle-scarred power armor of the Space Marines and array of weapons are rendered in striking detail, a sharp contrast to the grotesque, bio-engineered forms of the Tyranids, all of which soaked in the oppressive atmosphere of unending war, heightening the tension and chaos of combat. With dynamic lighting, explosive effects, and visceral melee animations, every visual element enhances the epic struggle for survival that is Warhammer 40k.


The audio design as a whole is superb, with each weapon producing a distinctive, hefty auditory punch that highlights their power and impact in combat. This is further complemented by immersive ambient battlefield sounds and compelling voice acting, creating a rich and engaging auditory landscape. The OST is exceptional, greatly enriching the overall experience. It features a mix of intense, atmospheric, orchestral arrangements to craft a dynamic soundtrack that adapts seamlessly to the gameplay, heightening emotional tension during intense battles, and even the calmer moments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game has many strengths but unfortunately fails in the most crucial aspect........the combat.

Playing on veteran (intended difficulty) fails as delivering the power fantasy of mowing down hordes of foes and brutally destroying worthy foes with consummate skill. The armour generating mechanic works but even horde enemies do so much damage it is often depleted immediately. The health regen mechanic just doesn't work - constantly getting downed, scrounging for medicae packs and spamming ultimate ability as much as possible just get some health back the core game play loop. Titus feel sluggish and the enemies are too bullet spongy. The combat just feels 'off'.

That being said, as a huge Warhammer fan, I loved the graphics, voice acting, musical score and the atmosphere of the game.

Just a shame about the actual game play loop.

Only get if you love 40k enough to overlook the flaws.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Review
DespuÃ©s de muchos aÃ±os desde el lanzamiento de la acciÃ³n original de los Marines Espaciales del mundo futurista de Warhammer, la secuela ha llegado. Te llena de adrenalina, pero tambiÃ©n puede traer la frustraciÃ³n de morir a menudo. Afortunadamente, no tienes que estar solo para luchar contra las hordas enemigas, y en compaÃ±Ã­a de amigos, tus posibilidades de tener Ã©xito y, sobre todo, de sobrevivir son mayores.

El personaje principal es el marine espacial Demetrian Titus, que era el personaje central de la primera parte y entonces todavÃ­a era capitÃ¡n. DespuÃ©s de ser acusado injustamente de corrupciÃ³n, es reasignado a la acciÃ³n, pero despuÃ©s de ser degradado con el rango de teniente. DespuÃ©s del desembarco de entrenamiento al comienzo de la campaÃ±a, ya no lucha solo, sino en compaÃ±Ã­a de los marines Chairon y Gadriel. Al jugar solo, sus roles serÃ¡n asumidos por bots, que pueden luchar decentemente y te revivirÃ¡n cuando sea necesario, pero no puedes dirigir sus acciones y no esperes una cooperaciÃ³n mÃ¡s cercana. Afortunadamente, puedes reemplazarlos invitando a otros jugadores antes de ingresar a una nueva misiÃ³n.

Directamente durante la campaÃ±a en la base, desde donde te transportan al Ã¡rea de la misiÃ³n, puedes saltar y jugar operaciones PvE separadas o enfrentarte a otros jugadores en el modo PvP de Eternal War con los objetivos de capturar territorios, capturar con control y aniquilaciÃ³n. Sin embargo, dado que recibimos el juego antes del lanzamiento, fue prÃ¡cticamente imposible encontrar oponentes vivos, pero al menos tuvimos suerte en las operaciones.

La ventaja de la campaÃ±a es la elecciÃ³n de la dificultad y el guardado automÃ¡tico del progreso en los puntos de control. Entonces, despuÃ©s de agotar las vidas o el nÃºmero de resurrecciones cuando caigas, continuarÃ¡s desde el Ãºltimo punto de control. Por el contrario, cada operaciÃ³n termina inmediatamente despuÃ©s de tu muerte (cuando progresas con compaÃ±eros de equipo en vivo despuÃ©s de la muerte de todo el equipo) y luego debes volver a pasar por todo de nuevo. AdemÃ¡s, las operaciones son bastante difÃ­ciles y no llegarÃ¡s muy lejos con los bots, aunque suelen revivirte.

Por otro lado, en las operaciones, puedes elegir la clase de tu personaje: hay seis de ellos para elegir, desde tÃ¡ctico, pasando por francotirador, hasta pesado. Incluso si fallas, ganas experiencia, niveles y nuevas ventajas por separado con cada enfoque utilizado. Aunque solo uno de ellos puede estar activo, pero definitivamente beneficioso en combate. AdemÃ¡s, puedes cambiar de equipo en la armerÃ­a de la base, donde desbloqueas nuevas armas, asÃ­ como sus variaciones avanzadas. AdemÃ¡s, puede personalizar la apariencia y las partes individuales de su cuerpo: casco, charreteras, placa pectoral, etc.

Lo interesante de las operaciones es que complementan la trama de la campaÃ±a, pero no es necesario pasar por ellas. Por ejemplo, sucede que Titus y su equipo deben cumplir el objetivo principal en el planeta, y al mismo tiempo otros tres marines deben llevar a cabo una acciÃ³n de distracciÃ³n de apoyo. El paso de Titus es necesario para la continuaciÃ³n de la campaÃ±a, pero puedes ignorar la acciÃ³n de distracciÃ³n o jugarlo en cualquier momento como parte de las operaciones.

En las misiones, progresas en diferentes entornos, tanto en interiores como en exteriores, pero siempre es una forma de corredor. Por lo tanto, solo puedes caminar por las calles demarcadas y no tienes la oportunidad de moverte libremente por la zona. Los objetivos son inicialmente bastante diversos, pero luego se repiten. Probablemente la mÃ¡s interesante es la protecciÃ³n de las cadenas de los ascensores o transmisores que intentan comerse a las criaturas voladoras. En el camino, recolectas municiones y equipo adicional, puedes cambiar de arma en los puestos. En lugares predeterminados, interactuarÃ¡ con los objetos seleccionados. Utiliza interruptores para activar mecanismos, abrir puertas o arrancar el ascensor, romper una barrera, etc.

Puede tener dos armas con usted, una de las cuales es un arma de mano mÃ¡s pequeÃ±a y, ademÃ¡s de ellas, tambiÃ©n un cuchillo, un martillo o una espada de energÃ­a. Al disparar, puede usar el zoom, donde la cÃ¡mara cambia de la vista en tercera persona a la primera persona y puede enfocar el objetivo con mayor precisiÃ³n, o incluso cambiar los modos de arma. En el combate a larga distancia, usarÃ¡s diferentes rifles y metralletas con diferente alcance, precisiÃ³n y cadencia. Sin embargo, la municiÃ³n debe usarse con prudencia, porque es bastante limitada y los suministros no siempre estÃ¡n a mano.

En los ataques cuerpo a cuerpo, literalmente cortarÃ¡s todo y usarÃ¡s ataques de Ã¡rea mÃ¡s fuertes, que son un placer para diezmar a los tirÃ¡nidos. Finalmente, cuando la vÃ­ctima estÃ¡ temporalmente inmovilizada y se ilumina en rojo, para poder ejecutarlos. Las ejecuciones no solo son impresionantes a la vista, sino que tambiÃ©n complementan instantÃ¡neamente algunas de tus armaduras. Se agota cuando se daÃ±a, y luego los enemigos te quitan la salud. Esto se puede restaurar parcialmente, pero usarÃ¡ estimulantes para una recuperaciÃ³n rÃ¡pida. Otro accesorio Ãºtil son las granadas.

Space Marine tiene grÃ¡ficos decentes con soporte DLSS y efectos y componentes estÃ¡ndar. La apariencia es agradable, principalmente debido al gran diseÃ±o de los sitios con atenciÃ³n al detalle. Se trata de hermosas vistas, por ejemplo, de una base militar, donde, ademÃ¡s de tu equipo, tambiÃ©n puedes ver a otros secuaces y unidades del emperador disparando a hordas de tirÃ¡nidos que se ciernen a lo lejos. Y cuando saltas a la acciÃ³n y eres asistido por un tanque, la atmÃ³sfera y la experiencia de combate son muy intensas. Sin mencionar que los fanÃ¡ticos acÃ©rrimos del universo de Warhammer 40K tambiÃ©n deben estar muy impresionados por los elementos autÃ©nticos, el procesamiento de armaduras, unidades y estructuras.

Space Marine 2, para un fan de Warhammer 40,000, es un sueÃ±o hecho realidad. Aunque no hace falta ser un Ã¡vido fan o haber jugado al capÃ­tulo anterior para apreciar el juego, lo cierto es que se ha hecho con el debido cuidado pensando en las personas que aman la franquicia y les habla con referencias muy especÃ­ficas y con algunas sorpresas. Con Space Marine 2 puedes esperar una acciÃ³n de pasillo sencilla con hectolitros de sangre, ubicaciones bien diseÃ±adas del universo de Warhammer 40,000 y mucha diversiÃ³n en compaÃ±Ã­a de otros jugadores. Al jugar en solitario, puedes disfrutar de unas 10-12 horas de campaÃ±a con una historia, pero el resto es casi injugable sin compaÃ±eros en vivo, aunque se pueden usar bots. Las operaciones cooperativas con amigos son excelentes, adrenalina, sin ellos aburrimiento y muerte rÃ¡pida. Y PvP es para medir las fortalezas y habilidades de los demÃ¡s. Por lo tanto, Space Marines 2 sobresale en el avance en modo cooperativo y la campaÃ±a tampoco se puede desperdiciar y no tienes que haber crecido en Warhammer para disfrutarlo..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exceptionnel, Ã©blouissant, jouissif, hyper bien opti.

Bref, les mots ne manquents pas pour parler de Space marine 2.
La campagne est un chef d'oeuvre, le mode PVE et PVP sont tres tres bon et on ne s'ennui pas. Toujours quelque chose a faire, a dÃ©bloquer etc...

Pour ce qui est de l'optimisation.
Elle est bonne, ceux qui s'en plaignent, j'ai du mal a comprendre.
La Gameplay est jouissif sans etre redondant
Les OST sont excellente, mais pas memorable
La campagne est courte, mais pour le coup EPIC
La Custom est aboutie, hate de voir la battlepass et les DLC a venir

En bref, aucun regret d'avoirs mis 90 euros. J'ai rarement Ã©tÃ© aussi content d'un achat videoludique. Si Focus et Saber font un suivi actif du jeu avec des ajouts important niveau custom, ennemi et niveau. Ca sera un EXCELLENT jeu qui a de longues annÃ©es devant lui

I want to recommend this game, I really do. But this is not an $80 game. Campaign took 5 hours, good story. Gameplay feels good, graphics are great. PvE is garbage right now, servers crap out on you. Just spent almost 2 hours trying to queue for a match and every time I got in it would disconnect me. I only made it into an actual game once, I killed two Rubric Marines and then was disconnected. PvP doesn't appeal to me so I haven't tried that, and likely won't.

I want more value from an $80 game than a 5hr campaign and a multiplayer that doesn't work. And they want seasons on top of that, slowly trickle out content that might have made this an $80 game over the next few years. If you can pick this up for half price or lower then you should grab this game, or maybe wait a year or two for the content to catch up to the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Wait for a sale or an update to fix things. I returned the game because it can take 10-15+ minutes just to start and once you're in it runs fairly well until it crashes and you start the process all over again. When I could actually play I really liked the game.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Als Fan des Warhammer 40K-Universums war ich von Space Marine 2 sofort gefesselt. Das Spiel bringt all das mit, was ich an diesem dÃ¼steren und brutalen Universum liebe: groÃŸartige Grafik, flÃ¼ssige Performance und eine packende AtmosphÃ¤re, die mich voll in die Schlachten des 41. Jahrtausends eintauchen lÃ¤sst.

Grafik â€?Eine beeindruckende Reise ins Chaos

Die Grafik ist schlichtweg atemberaubend. Von den detaillierten RÃ¼stungen der Space Marines bis zu den schier endlosen Horden der Tyraniden â€?jedes Modell ist ein visuelles Highlight. Die Umgebungen sind dÃ¼ster und episch zugleich, genau wie man es von Warhammer 40K erwartet. Besonders beeindruckend fand ich, wie die Explosionen und KÃ¤mpfe visuell eingefangen wurden. Jeder Treffer hat Wucht, jede Explosion lÃ¤sst den Bildschirm erzittern, und die Schlachtfelder verwandeln sich schnell in Ruinen. Es ist, als wÃ¼rde man mitten in einer Schlacht stehen.

Performance â€?FlÃ¼ssig, auch wenn es hektisch wird

Selbst bei den grÃ¶ÃŸten Schlachten bleibt die Performance stabil. Ich hatte keine EinbrÃ¼che in der Bildrate, auch wenn Dutzende von Tyraniden auf dem Bildschirm wÃ¼teten. Das Spiel lÃ¤uft bemerkenswert flÃ¼ssig und zeigt, wie gut optimiert es ist. Besonders beeindruckend ist, wie es selbst auf mittleren Systemen stabil lÃ¤uft, ohne an visueller QualitÃ¤t zu verlieren.

SpielgefÃ¼hl â€?Intensiv und brachial

Was mir besonders gefallen hat, ist das GefÃ¼hl, tatsÃ¤chlich ein Space Marine zu sein. Space Marine 2 schafft es, die Wucht und StÃ¤rke eines Ultramarines perfekt zu vermitteln. Jede Nahkampfatacke fÃ¼hlt sich wuchtig an, und die Bolter-SchÃ¼sse haben einen befriedigenden Klang. Man hat das GefÃ¼hl, unaufhaltsam durch die Feinde zu pflÃ¼gen â€?und genau so soll es sein! Die Steuerung ist dabei intuitiv und flÃ¼ssig, sodass es SpaÃŸ macht, durch die gegnerischen Horden zu wÃ¼ten.

AtmosphÃ¤re â€?Das 41. Jahrtausend zum Leben erweckt

Space Marine 2 fÃ¤ngt die dÃ¼stere AtmosphÃ¤re des Warhammer 40K-Universums perfekt ein. Die BrutalitÃ¤t, die Hoffnungslosigkeit und die stÃ¤ndige Bedrohung durch die Tyraniden sind in jedem Moment spÃ¼rbar. Der Soundtrack und die GerÃ¤uscheffekte tragen zur Immersion bei â€?von donnernden Explosionen bis zum furchteinflÃ¶ÃŸenden BrÃ¼llen der Feinde. Man fÃ¼hlt sich wirklich, als kÃ¤mpfe man um das Ãœberleben der Menschheit.

Fazit â€?Ein Muss fÃ¼r 40K-Fans

Space Marine 2 ist ein intensives, visuell beeindruckendes Erlebnis. Es fÃ¤ngt die AtmosphÃ¤re des Warhammer 40K-Universums perfekt ein und bietet eine flÃ¼ssige, kraftvolle Spielerfahrung. FÃ¼r Fans von Warhammer 40K ist dieses Spiel ein Muss!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game is literally a shooter from 2008. Short but awesome campaign, coop PVE mode, and an uncomplicated PVP mode. No battlepasses, no battle royale, no lootboxes, no MTX â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (although there are some one time purchase cosmetics).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game is fun.
What's not fun is waiting over twenty minutes for the game to start. All it does after the patch (and most times prior to patch) is sit at a black screen and won't load beyond that.
I'm less concerned with keeping the game balanced and more about the ability to play it at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 macht SpaÃŸ und hÃ¤lt sich einigermaÃŸen gut an die Vorlagen und schlieÃŸt gut an den ersten Teil an. Die Kampagne sieht gut aus und hÃ¶rt sich gut an und das SpielgefÃ¼hl insgesamt ist solide. Die Koop Missionen sind spaÃŸig aber insgesamt kurzweilig, da wird ja aber noch nachgereicht. Der Multiplayer ist bisher leider echt mies. PersÃ¶nlich finde ich die Steuerung auch nicht wirklich gut, kann aber auch verstehen, dass es kompliziert ist bei 2 verschiedenen Main Waffen, die gleichzeitig zum Einsatz kommen. Die meisten Spieler verhalten sich wie absolute Bots, der Sound ist gedÃ¤mpft und die Maps sind super langweilig. Fans von 40k und Shooter fans werden aber zufriedengestellt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ok I was happy with the game but now after the patch its a technical mess. Audio stutters and framerate issues that was no there before. Was playing just fine 2 days ago and I come back to resume with a broken game post patch. Characters dont load in cutscenes anymore either. What the heck. It was running great before. Now I cant play it properly anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great game, combat feels heavy, which I absolutely love, but I cannot understand the ""balancing"". Half of the map I have to run without any ammo left in my weapons and god forbid a mini-boss spawns because I'll be running be into the previous sector, if I could, but most of the time it is locked off already as ""the point of no return"". Having no ammo doesn't make the game more ""challenging"", just more frustrating. I'm sorry that I'm trying to have fun in a shooter game by using my weapons and ammo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An absolutely brilliant game, that really encapsulates the feeling of the bulk of a Space Marine. You get the feeling of sense and bulk, which is not always present in depictions of Space Marines.

While there were initially issues with PvE missions not starting, these were fixed quickly. Gameplay, visual design and sound design are all great. A worthy successor to Space Marine I, and definitely my pick for GOTY.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Would not recommend it, AT THIS TIME. Campaign story writing is amazing, 10/10. But gameplay? solid 6/10. Feels very slow and clunky. Sort of how i imagine fighting in a giant metal suit of armour would actually be. You might be a tank but you're a slow tank with very delayed mobility. You can roll, but enjoy the 4 business days before it works. Furthermore, 8 hours in 2024 to beat a campaign? Felt very rushed. Six Operations that tie in to the campaign, again clunky but gun play feels good. But the disconnects every few games and the hackers on day 1 make that a moot point. More so," there's 3 game modes with a couple maps. It gets very repetitive very fast. Definitely not enough content to be a triple A game with triple A pricing.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Edit 10/28/2024 - Patch 4.0 rolled back some of the..worst changes. However, Chaos is still incredibly unfun to fight for the below reasons. They mention things like win percentages, but I wonder if that's Chaos and Tyranid missions lumped together. The buffs to bolters are..lackluster. They still remain the option for someone wanting to shoot themselves in the foot. I'll mark it recommended but hestitantly.

I won't lie. It was pretty bearable at release but.. I don't really know what the devs are doing in regards to balance and I don't think they know either. Everything I'm about to write is taken from someone who runs 90% difficulty 4 of 5 (Ruthless) and has their survivor helmet from the Lethal (5/5) missions. And this is all for PVE only.

They've done balance passes nerfing the damage on weapons when most of the weapons are already pretty bad.

Chaos majoris are the examplars of this poor design. They can teleport around in an instant. You will need to do about a dozen or two full melee combos to down them but, they can teleport away without warning.

The flamer chaos marines are the worst of the worst. They can teleport without warning in the middle of your combo, charge up a dodge only attack while you're still in an animation that you can't animation cancel out of, and reduce your armor and a good chunk of your HP near instantly. Even if they don't teleport, your dodge roll is shorter than the AOE ring you need to flee from but you won't have time to do the second dodge roll before you're hit. They have incredible range but that doesn't matter because, again, they can teleport to you.

And you may think the answer is a gun. But because the guns have been near nerfed into the ground - you will need to spend multiple magazines per marine.

And they did do a patch that made fighting chaos ... not so bad. And then immediately rolled that back partially and amped up the grind by making us worse at fighting into it.

It's starting to feel that a very vocal minority of players at the upper band of skill levels are dictating the required skill level of all the average skill level players.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've only ever dipped my toes in the Warhammer universe, mostly through my friends hobbies and other games based in the universe such as darktide or inquisitor martyr. Despite having little knowledge I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign and felt invested in Titus's story, the gameplay is fairly solid but nothing revolutionary and the game in it's current state is a good base with some content but more importantly it has great potential to be built on.

The game is Warhammer 40K through and through. Grim, Dark and gritty.

The story is good and introduces you to why Titus got turned into a Primaris well.
For the obvious culture war question: No, it is not ""woke"".

Combat is violent and satisfying. A similar experience to what I recently had with Batman Arkham Knight. It is challenging.
(Countering, dodging and learning patterns etc, but it is more simplified here).
When you play as Titus you FEEL like a Space Marine. The power of the melee attacks, ripping enemies limb from limb. The shaking footsteps where you can 'feel' the weight behind every step. The thunderous boom as so much armour, meat, bone and muscle hits the ground after jumping down a ledge.

Started the game on hardest difficulty, and it is very challenging. Still determining if it will be possible to finish playing solo with bots. Edit: Seems possible, but is very challenging. Would only suggest ""Angel of death"" difficulty for the most dedicated players.

Shooting is also satisfying, but can't be completely relied on, engaging in melee is nearly mandatory once swarms close in.

Visuals are very impressive and faithfully 40K.

Sounds are all great and when involved in fighting give you the feeling you are in a battle.
Music is dark and 100% fits 40K theme. The main theme when the game starts actually sent chills down my back. (Awe inspiring).

After a quick look, operations and Endless War mode will provide plenty of replay opportunity.
Edit: Operations is thoroughly enjoyable. Levelling up is fun and very satisfying to become more powerful with more perks, better weapons and the armour skins are beautiful. The artists REALLY put effort into them!

On technical and performance, the game is running beautifully. RTX 3060, I7-10700K, 32GB RAM, SSD, Windows 11. Ultra settings, native resolution @ 1080P with TAA gives 40-60 frames. Lowest frames I've experienced so far are 30 in graphically intensive portions. (Considering my hardware is not high end, the performance was surprising to me, it shows the game is well optimised in my opinion).

The game practically oozes all the effort and work the developers put into the game and definitely worth any 40K fan's attention.

Some are saying it has Epic. The game makes use of Epic online services. (Not an app, just core components that allow crossplay between Steam and Epic as well as the needed files for Easy Anti Cheat. No Epic account was required when I started the game and none created that I am aware of).

A couple of technical issues I can't figure out, sometimes voice lines are normal, then barely audible (with subtitles it isn't too much of a problem, but if playing without them you strain to hear them.)

The most glaring problem is that the so called anti-cheat is doing nothing to keep cheaters out from ruining the game for others. That alone is enough to spoil the entire experience in PVE and PVP.

Couldn't join a friend in campaign and still looking for a solution. (Will update review if I find one or find the cause). Edit: I was able to join friends today with a few retry attempts, but connecting isn't reliable and sometimes doesn't work. Edit #2: Connection much better. Regularly join with friends now and only disconnections now and then.

Edit: No crashes or glitches thus far with exception that sometimes a save seems to glitch out and you restart a checkpoint with lower ammo, different primary than the one you chose along the mission, meds and health than you had when you reached the checkpoint. (This happened to me on ""Severance"" mission when mobbing me. Unknown what exactly happens to cause the glitch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My initial thoughts were that the game is an improvement in every conceivable way over the first one. It obviously looks better, has more combat mechanics, more equipment, additional gameplay modes. However the more I think about the game and try to engage with its mechanics the more frustrating it becomes. At this point in time I only recommend buying this on a sale of at least 30% if not more.

At this moment the game is significantly overpriced for what little it offers.
The campaign is short and looks extremely cool.
PvE has six linear maps in total, each is completed in about 25 minutes or less.
PvP I haven't played because despite there being an anti cheat there are plenty of cheaters anyway.
Congrats on wasting money on EAC.

The visuals are amazing. They are the best part of the game. I know the visuals and assets for the game were incredibly expensive (they look the part) and therefore there isn't that much content, but I wish the gameplay came first. But it truly looks absolutely amazing.

The gameplay, sadly, comes far behind the visuals. At the moment it can be downright painful at times.
I spent the majority of my time thus far in PvE (online coop). My problems with it are as follows:

Class lock in PvE feels awful. You cannot play with a full squad of tactical/devastator/assault. I'm not sure what came first, the idea for class lock and then they decided to make each character ""unique"" to compensate or whether it was the other way around. Anyway it doesn't feel good to be restricted in this way in a game that has so little content to do.
The voice lines attached to each character aren't even that hyperspecific to their class, they would be passable on other classes.

Enemies have mile long healthbars. Knowing the lore it makes sense to me (in particular for larger tyranid gribblies and Tsons) but with how its done in the game it makes combat feel like a chore at times. You just keep shooting your gun or wailing on an enemy with your melee weapon and its not having any noticeable effect other than vfx/sparks (which look nice).
The majoris+ enemies should have more flinch/stagger animations at least when getting shot.
I think its a miss to not add some sort of battle damage system where nids get their limbs hacked/blown off but keep coming at you. The Tsons could have ceramite, adamantium and engravings getting shorn off their armor from bolter fire.
In fact it would be cool if we could shoot off the guns off ranged enemies.

Just something that shows the player ""this guy is taking damage"", not just particle effects.
Small enemies have the beginning of this system, but it doesn't feel right.
Shooting a termagant for it to reset the 1st frame of the same ""owie I'm hit"" animation 6 times in a row makes me feel like my weapon is either a nerf gun or downright bugged.

Its extremely disappointing with how little damage melee weapons deal. The finishers and their animations are extremely cool, I wish there were more and changed with direction you approach an enemy, like in Doom 2016/eternal. I also wish I could decide whether my marine does a hand-to-hand finisher or uses his weapon to do it.
However taking several swings at a termagant/tzaangor with a thunder hammer only for it to keep fighting just feels bad.

The melee feels inconsistent in most situations. Parry and dodge sometimes just don't work, or possibly due to nearby enemies overlapping their attacks when close to you they force you to miss the parry and dodge window. Then you get stuck in the block animation (where at first you don't take damage) but you can't input any command, and then another comes in and keeps you stunlocked and makes you lose majority of your health.

The worst parts of melee is when you are in a crowd and get attacked by lots of small enemies - hormogants or tzaangors. Their attacks come out very fast and overlap and clip through each other, either forcing you to miss the parry window on the warrior/Tson and you block and then take damage, or you just whiff the parry and take damage anyway. Let me dodge/step out of a parry animation please.

Enemies have iframes on their dodges. It feels like you're being cheated out of what little damage you can put out.

The gunstrike is way too slow and I died multiple times while locked in the animation. Its generally a theme for how deaths happen in the game, you get stuck in some sort of animation/stagger you have no way of cancelling or getting out of and then you die.

The jump pack makes me very sad. In the campaign it worked just fine, but it is gutted in PvE.
Lets say you want to jump over a chasm or from one walkway to another, but they are separated by about 2 meters of empty space.
The game seems to draw a line from the base of your character and directly in front of a him. That line must be drawn over terrain you can walk on.
If that line encounters impassable terrain, such as a small safety barrier or a gap, in 90% of situations you can't jump over the barrier or that gap. So you see a distance you are certain you can jump over, you could walk to your target (so you know you should be able to jump there), but the game just doesn't let you. In addition, sometimes when the jump indicator (at the end of the line being drawn mentioned above) hits or collides with certain objects, the jump just won't activate. It just feels very janky and unsatisfying to use.

Now when you jump up, you can do a slam attack where the marine flies at high speed to the target on the ground.
You'd think the victim of that attack would get turned to paste after getting hit.
Nope. They just get staggered a bit.
In addition, during your slam attack you first hover midair ""charging"" the attack. This looks weird and should be removed, if anything the marine at the apex of the jump should slow down a bit, but not become stationary, and as gravity pulls him down he uses the jump pack to get more speed. Also during that little hover I get hit by melee attacks which shouldn't be able to reach me.

It feels incredibly unsatisfying, in particular with how long the cooldown is on the jump. With how little height you get from the jump I think it would be better if instead of a slam attack, it was a targeted charge where there is only 1 target (no AoE), but that target takes lots of damage and likely dies. That and also the marine hits the target with his weapon, not slams it into the ground. Also the jump pack should be the go to choice for tackling flying enemies (zoanthropes, levitating sorcerers), but there is no such option, You can either do a dash on the ground, jump from A to B, or jump and do a ground slam. There is a cutscene in the campaign that shows exactly how a jump pack should feel (it looks a bit OP there I'll admit, but it looks insanely fun) but having seen it and then trying the jump pack for yourself feels like you got cheated.

The ranged combat suffers from the same principal issue as melee - you just don't feel like you're doing any damage or that enemies are at all affected by taking multiple headshots in a row.
I think its most telling that the most fun to be had was using the the underslung grenade launcher or the sniper las fusil and two or three shotting majoris enemies. The melta is excellent at staggering hordes and clearing smaller enemies and leaving the large guys to take care of - honestly this should be a flamer (which for some reason is absent from PvE) and the melta should have a smaller blast but be the choice weapon to deal with heavy armour as in the lore.
When you have strong weapons which have direct impact like the three I mentioned, the ranged combat felt good. However, 90% of the guns do not have such an impact and therefore feel like trash.

Additionally, the amount of spread would be fine for a standard human, but how can an astartes have this much inaccuracy and spread? It makes no sense to me, in particular when all enemies are great at leading the player.

Its all so tiresome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 is a must-buy game that harkens back to the politics-free heyday of gaming. It is like taking a time machine back to the 2010s and going through all those beautifully made games during that era. It also shows how far AAA gaming has fallen. All publishers and development teams should take note and do better, focusing primarily on player experience over 'sending the message' and monetization. Saber Interactive should be very proud of what they have made.

If, like me, you are disappointed with the needless disrespect towards canon and established lore by Games Workshop lately, then you need not fear Space Marine 2. Space Marine 2 follows the story of Captain Titus in a way that respects what has been and does not cater to the tourists and nu-Warhammer fans destroying the hobby currently. Any true Warhammer fans can buy Space Marine 2 guilt-free.

The single-player campaign is long enough to provide a story that ties into the Era Indomitus and the previous story of the first Space Marine game. Playing it solo can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, but I found it to be well worth playing and had very few issues with it even though I finished it on early patches.

Playing Operations solo is also likewise a very meaningful experience that you cannot replicate elsewhere. I am ecstatic that Saber Interactive is continuing to develop more missions for this mode. The mission where you kill the Bio-Titan is my new favourite. I have had a few drops when I played it, but otherwise, I have not had any major issues.

Multiplayer is fun, but I still think the Bulwark class is overpowered, and some balancing is necessary. It is not a mode I have played a ton, but I can report no major issues.

A huge bonus is that the usual suspects hate Space Marine 2 and its success:



Another bonus is that the CEO of Saber Interactive is incredibly based:



As is some of their dev team:



I give Space Marine 2 a very solid 9/10, only citing some minor technical issues in Operations mode. Space Marine 2 is my game of the year this year on Steam, and I highly encourage anybody to buy it. Whether this is your first or tenth Warhammer game, this is a worthy buy and entry into the grimdark universe of 40k. Well done to Saber Interactive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a long-time fan of the Warhammer 40K universe and someone who enjoyed the original Space Marine, Space Marine 2 has completely blown me away!

From the moment I stepped into the boots of Captain Titus once again, I was hooked. The combat is absolutely brutal in all the best ways. Whether you're smashing through hordes of Tyranids with a chainsword or mowing them down with bolter fire, the action is fast, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. The melee and ranged combat balance feels perfect, and pulling off those savage executions never gets old.

The visuals are a massive leap forward compared to the first game. The environments are gritty and detailed, really capturing the grimdark essence of the 40K universe. Whether youâ€™re fighting in ruined cityscapes or alien-infested hives, it all looks stunning and immersive.

One of the biggest highlights for me is the coop multiplayer. Playing with friends and unleashing the wrath of the Emperor as a team is an absolute blast. The teamwork and coordination required to survive against the swarms of enemies really elevates the experience, making it feel like youâ€™re part of a true Space Marine squad.

Graphics 9/10
Gameplay 9/10
Performance 7/10
Both PVP and Operations are fun addition.

If youâ€™re a fan of Warhammer 40K, third-person action games, or just love co-op gameplay, Space Marine 2 is a must-play. Itâ€™s everything you want from a sequel and then some. For the Emperor!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Przyjemna, sentymentalna wrÄ™cz podrÃ³Å¼ do ery PS360, kiedy to wiÄ™kszoÅ›Ä‡ gier akcji ukierunkowanych na pojedynczego gracza byÅ‚a wolna od zbÄ™dnych udziwnieÅ„ i tony rozpraszaczy. W takim wÅ‚aÅ›nie duchu, w poÅ‚Ä…czeniu ze wspÃ³Å‚czesnÄ… oprawÄ…, powstaÅ‚ Space Marine 2.

JuÅ¼ od pierwszych chwil w kampanii czuÄ‡, Å¼e gra wie, czym chce byÄ‡ i dokÅ‚adnie to oferuje. Walka jest miÄ™sista i miodna, a przy tym prosta lecz nie prostacka i sumarycznie jest satysfakcjonujÄ…ca. Naszej uwagi nie rozprasza nawet jakikolwiek rozwÃ³j postaci, a i znajdÅºki sÄ… szczÄ…tkowe (audiologi, ktÃ³re zresztÄ… Å‚atwo przeoczyÄ‡).

Gameplayowo fani GearsÃ³w poczujÄ… siÄ™ tu jak w domu, bo za wyjÄ…tkiem chowania siÄ™ za osÅ‚onami, dostanÄ… wszystko, za co polubili seriÄ™ od Microsoftu. Protagonista oraz inni kosmiczni marines to odpowiednie gigachady, choÄ‡ moÅ¼e bardziej od testosteronu czuÄ‡ tu ich fanatyzm.
Na minus SM2 z kolei wypada mniejsza rÃ³Å¼norodnoÅ›Ä‡ rozgrywki. Biegamy, strzelamy, siekamy bÄ…dÅº tÅ‚uczemy lub robimy uniki â€?tylko tyle, nie liczÄ…c dwÃ³ch doÅ›Ä‡ krÃ³tkich momentÃ³w w ktÃ³rych dostajemy jetpack umoÅ¼liwiajÄ…cy chwilowe wzbijanie siÄ™ w powietrze. Szkoda, aÅ¼ prosiÅ‚oby siÄ™ choÄ‡by o jakieÅ› sekwencje celowniczkowe na pokÅ‚adzie maszyn bojowych, ktÃ³rych w trakcie opowieÅ›ci widzimy caÅ‚y wachlarz.

StrzelajÄ…c i rÄ…biÄ…c ku chwale Imperatora od razu czuÄ‡, Å¼e jesteÅ›my potÄ™Å¼ni.

Co ciekawe, to samo nie tyczy siÄ™ paska zdrowia â€?tu jesteÅ›my uzaleÅ¼nieni od znajdowania apteczek, ktÃ³rych jest doÅ›Ä‡ niewiele.
8-10h, jakie naleÅ¼y poÅ›wiÄ™ciÄ‡ na ukoÅ„czenie singla, przedÅ‚uÅ¼yÄ‡ moÅ¼na jeszcze misjami co-opowymi, na jakieÅ› 30-45 minut kaÅ¼da.

Jest jeszcze tryb PvP, ale o nim nie mam za duÅ¼o do powiedzenia. Szkoda jedynie, Å¼e na premierÄ™ zabrakÅ‚o trybu hordy. Ma byÄ‡ dodany kiedyÅ› tam

Ode mnie solidne 8/10 i polecajka, dla wszystkich, ktÃ³rym tÄ™skno do efektownej akcji i miÄ™sistego strzelania.

This game is amazing..... Well it could be if it didnt have the issues it currently suffers.

My main gripes with this game are the connection Issues - Stuck at loading screens(joining friends or matches), Matchmaking not finding players. Just server connection altogether. I can play maybe one game then the matchmaking breaks for me and wont find anyone else then I inevitably lose connection to the server. This is HIGHLY annoying and one of many reasons that I cannot recommend getting/playing this game right now. I have had crashes multiple times (other friends had full PC crashes with a brand new PC) Mine was only the application that crashed. Also multiplayer party size being cut from 5 to 3 was a low blow and for what? Like WHY?

I want to love this game but in its current state I cant and it really sucks because this if a very fun game (when it works properly)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AprÃ¨s quelques dizaines d'heures je peux estimer le droit de donner un avis le plus objectif possible.

Oui le jeu est bon, trÃ¨s bon.

La campagne est belle, les environnements soignÃ©s et offre un bon moment divertissant avec des cotÃ©s Ã©piques (la fin est monstrueuse) ... et un bon apprentissage des diffÃ©rentes armes et compÃ©tences. Bon c'est pas un scÃ©nario dans la subtilitÃ© mais c'est du warhammer, faut pas dÃ©conner, on est la pour bourriner ;)
Les missions en coop sont vraiment sympa, les cartes et les mÃ©canismes sont bien diffÃ©rentes des unes aux autres et la difficultÃ© est trÃ¨s intÃ©ressante. Evidemment avec des potes en vocal c'est bien plus agrÃ©able.
Point nÃ©gatif cependant, 3 en coop c'est un peu lÃ©ger ... ou alors ne pas avoir beaucoup de potes :D

Aucun avis en PvP je n'en fais pas.

We do not know what our chances of survival are, so we fight as if they were zero. We do not know what we are facing, so we fight as if it was the dark gods themselves. No one will remember us now and we may never be buried beneath Titan, so we will build our own memorial here. The Chapter might lose us and the Imperium might never know we existed, but the Enemy â€?the Enemy will know. The Enemy will remember. We will hurt it so badly that it will never forget us until the stars burn out and the Emperor vanquishes it at the end of time. When Chaos is dying, its last thought will be of us. That is our memorial â€?carved into the heart of Chaos. We cannot lose, Grey Knights. We have already won.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To preface, my review was negative, due to patch 4.0 which introduced a bunch of changes a week ago at the time I am writing this.

Today we had another patch that reversed said changes, and after playing for a few hours, I can honestly say that Space Marine 2 is back in a good position again. This is of course subjective, but I am clearly not alone having this viewpoint.

In its current state SM2 is gory, engaging, testosteronie- filled fun. I usually stick to various RPG, and haven't really enjoyed a shooter (if you can even call it that) since Battlefield 1942.

I can't stop playing this though.

You have a campaign, which takes about 7 hour'ish to complete. While that might sound short, it is highly entertaining. The quality is top notch. At least I was having a blast blasting, hacking and swordchainsaw'ing my way through it.

Than you have the online part. As someone who is generally burned out of online games, this still has hooked me. You have PvE coop missions, called operations, where you and 2 fellow Space Marines clear out 1 of 7 maps. You can chose between 5 difficulties. The lowest one being very easy, the hardest one .. well.. hard.

I could probably write an essay about this game, but bottomline:
This is my years Baldurs Gate 3. Totally different genres, but both are game of the year content for me.

Also kudos to Sabre for listening to the community feedback. They reverted a highly unpopular patch in 1 week. They are also introducing public test servers. So this is apparently a company that listens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

~~The game is very fun but they broke the game on linux after it had been working since launch, therefore I cannot give a positive review. This will change if it ever works again. To be clear, I dont fault a game for not working on linux I will simply not buy it, but breaking it after its working is not acceptable.~~

The game is working with the most recent patch as long as you put ```SteamDeck=1 %command%``` in your launch options.

the negative reviews are absolutely retarded. Epic services is for crossplay, restart your pc if you're crashing (common sense), an fov slider isnt a requirement and its not worth refunding your game for, but it would be nice to have. AND TAA IS NOT FORCED. USE NATIVE AND IT DOESNT CHANGE ANYTHING.
the only fair complaint is no ultrawide support, but again thats not really game ruining but can definitely be a disappointment.

Mixed on release because people are valve shills who hate epic, or they're too stupid to read or reset their pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II, is an alien murder machine simulator developed by Saber Interactive and published by those guys that made their fortune making cycling simulators.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On the planet Kedaku, a Deathwatch Killteam is sent in to deploy a virus bomb to, at the very least, slow down the Tyranid hordes ravaging the planet. Demetrian Titus, former Ultramarine and current Ordos Xenos clean up crew member, however, by his former Chapter, and Titus is reinstated as Lieutenant of the Ultramarineâ€™s 2nd Company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also, his Killteam all died. They seemed nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now, having undergone the Rubicon procedure, Titus is now one of those Space Marines that are taller than normal Space Marines, but their armor isnâ€™t as cool so it always kind of feels wrong. He, along with squad members Chairon and Gadriel (not to be confused with that elf lady from The Lord of the Rings: Galadriel),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some people waited thirteen years for this game, I was one of them. Space Marine II is practically a continuation of the first game with some new and cool features added on. No longer being restrained on the 360 and PS3, Space Marine II does a great job actually capturing the scale and numbers of a Tyranid invasion of a planet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Space Marine II, like the first one, is a third person shooter revolving around shooting aliens in the face and then tearing them apart with whatever beating stick you have on hand. There are a variety of weapons to choose from such as, the Bolt rifle, the other Bolt Rifle, the bolt rifle but with a better scope, the one that shoots plasma, the melta gun that feels like youâ€™re pushing your hand through a ball of wet socks when you use it. And also a bunch of melee weapons like: The knife the side of my entire body, a chainsword so I can stab you while Iâ€™m stabbing you, the power sword which is like a regular sword but also cuts thing gooder, and the big hammer you use because your message wasnâ€™t clear enough when the chainsword was being used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a neat mix of Gears of War shooting and hack and slash action. Dumping an entire magazine of bolt rounds into a swarm of Tyranids and then laying into them with whatever melee weapon you have on hand is the bread and butter of the game play, and its a pretty good bread and butter. Its like the first game where you turn grots and Orks into Swiss cheese, but now theres a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton more Tyranids than there were Orks in the first game, and slicing through them in swathes is basically dopamine injected straight into my brain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are also larger, angrier, hornier Tyranids that accompany the swarms. Warriors are the most common, but you do occasionally have to deal with other variants like the Lictor, a stealthy bastard, a big bastard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zoanthropes are there too, but who cares.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mission variety is mostly just trying to stem the tide of alien bugs, either by blowing them up good or deploying something that upsets them. But thereâ€™s some intrigue in the story, enough to keep you hooked with the plot, like a big reveal that I canâ€™t mention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chaos is there, Tzeentch flavored this time. Thatâ€™s not a spoiler, theyâ€™re in the promotional material. Thatâ€™s not the big reveal, though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Outside of the story mode, you also have two multiplayer modes to keep you coming back. Operations is a 3 player Co-Op mode where you and two of your Space Marine pals do stuff that helps Titus and the 2nd Company, as well as the Cadian 8th and any other Imperial butt hole in the system, deal with the invaders and send them packing. Its an interesting mode, almost reminds me of Left 4 Dead sometimes, just make sure you have 2 other pals to play with or else an NPC follows you around and thatâ€™s lame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The OTHER other mode is PVP, the Eternal War is an 8 vs 8 man murder mode where the Primaris Astartes do battle with the Heretic Astartes, the Chaos Space Marines, the LEGIONES TRAITORIS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You have several classes to pick from, the same ones you pick in Operations, and then go to town on one another, either trying to kill 50 of them before they kill 50 of you or holding objectives until the timer runs out or the meter fills up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a goofy, fun, chaotic time, but its also frustrating at points. It feels like kind of an after thought in a way. And the name of the game seems to be grouping up and melting the other guys via focused fire before they can melt you. You can do some clever things every now and then with your class abilities, but it mostly comes down to who sees who first and who pulls the trigger faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I like the game a lot, solid 8/10 for me, thereâ€™s just some things that irk me the wrong way. A lot of the weapons feel undertuned. I feel like when a weapon is basically â€œThe one you start with, but bigger.â€?it should feel like it. I think a Tyranid Warrior, the ranged ones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Boltguns in general also feel weak, I mean that in a game feel kind of way, not in a balance way, it does have problems balance wise, but. The way it sounds just sounds weak to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Bolter in the first game was mean, it sounded like someone was punching the side of a car door really hard. The Bolt Rifle however may as well be making a â€œpew pewâ€?sound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also, please put more attention into the PVP. I donâ€™t know exactly how to fix it, maybe new maps and random spawns or fine tune the weapon a bit better? It feels like an afterthought since it was in the first game, which it might have been.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah I like it a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Space Marine II does a good job in capturing that fantasy of being a giant, 8ft tall meat mountain murder machine in a messed up super future. Your steps are big and stompy, and everything you hit with any kind of weapon just turns into a fountain of blood. Tyranids coming at you in the hundreds and literally climbing over one another like a tidal wave to get up a wall is amazing to see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Warhammer 40,000 is such a weird franchise to me, mostly just because of where it stands as a series. Its a tabletop War game with a lot of extended universe material like books, comics, and yâ€™know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Having been a Necron Player for the last 20 years or so, because I like winning and Terminator kicks ass, I got to see the war game I love fluctuate and change, introducing new people, sometimes for the better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40K is the only War Game I know where a good chunk of the fanbase actively refuses to play it. Even a lot of the other material is -mostly- ignored in favor of just reading summaries on wikis around the internet. Warpath and Mutant Chronicles probably donâ€™t have this problem, and you probably donâ€™t even know what those are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And if you do, hey! We should play sometime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its a series that people want to change, mostly for the worse. Its also a series that people are way too invested in, and not even from a financial point of view. This endless war on the internet about what 40k should and shouldnâ€™t be is, hilariously enough, sort of indicative of the franchise as a whole. An endless battle between people that donâ€™t actually want a common ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Its still very near and dear to my heart, but thereâ€™s probably going to come a time in the future where I might just have to move on. Mostly because of corporate â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™? but if my friends are all gone, I may as well go too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine II: The Return of Titus Meat Man gets 8 Bolt rounds out of 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After watching the trailer, I was already looking forward to it, and after watching the trial, I was even more excited! Finally, when I was able to play, I encountered numerous difficulties from downloading, installing, to the silly Epic and subspace server, and managed to finish the plot in the first place. I feel a bit disappointed, but I can only say that the advantages and disadvantages of the game you made are basically the same as those of World War of Zombies, with too little content. But there is one difference, the 40k world view volume of Warhammer makes me feel like I spent 399 to buy a DLC. It's just a multiplayer task that can be played for a while, but with only six maps, it won't last long. It can only be said that the future is promising.
Here are some of my personal opinions. Although I feel that the development of this game is still like a semi-finished product, there is still potential for this platform. The tank, armored vehicle, terminator, and various models of knights and titans in the 40k world are game content waiting for you to develop skins for various battle groups. Isn't it selling them for sale. I also saw suggestions in the comments to create a multiplayer battlefield mode and throw these contents into the online game, which will definitely be packed with players. If the balance of the battlefield mode game is done well, there will still be a group of long-term players. There are so many tribes in the Warhammer World that can be developed to the point of devastation. I believe that in addition to loyal players and followers of the Chaos Four Gods, there is also a large number of players who want to experience the magical battles of the Great Waaaag with Brother Mao! Imagine killing invisibly like Licat and chopping SM like a warrior bug, like chopping melons and vegetables. The devourer will eat when hungry. If you want to follow the will of the best way to conquer the universe, or just wake up and find that your home has been mechanically taught to the space undead that has been dug through, you should know that Hammer Friends are not only loyal players of various races and forces. You can also develop a one-on-one mode or battle flag mode to rank and so on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game is the embodiment of too much hype

Cons
-Comes out with DLC already being advertised
-Poor servers that lag (even during single player)
-Single player story is around 8h on hardest difficulty
-PvP mode is bare bones with painfully slow progression that locks any real customisation with high levels (not to mention you can only customise your look half the time as you're forced to wear heretic armour during half the matches which you can't customise)
-Loading screens on loading screens on loading screens (You might think I'm exaggerating to emphasise but you will have to do a loading screen to go into another loading screen for all multiplayer modes)

Pros
-Looks cool, visuals are really nice
-Its warhammer 40k

Do not buy on full price wait for a sale.

I personally do not understand why they haven't fleshed things out and opted for purchasable cosmetic route rather than half releasing the game with a DLC promised on launch.

If anyone is willing to buy cosmetics its warhammer 40k fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J'adore l'univers de Warhammer 40K, j'avais adorÃ© le premier opus et les premiÃ¨res previews de ce Space Marine 2 Ã©taient dithyrambiques alors j'ai foncÃ© : prÃ©commande, ultra Ã©dition collector etc...

Et au final, aprÃ¨s 8 h de jeu : un gros ""mouais""...

Oui, le lore est fidÃ¨le, oui, c'est ultra bourrin, oui, c'est joli mais... c'est tout.

Ã€ cÃ´tÃ© de Ã§a, le jeu est pas super bien optimisÃ© sur PC, c'est lourd et confus Ã  manier, trÃ¨s rÃ©pÃ©titif, le PVP est bien faible cÃ´tÃ© contenu et finitions, les menus sont pÃ©nibles et le tout manque cruellement de QoL... Et puis, ce choix d'avoir mis les Tyrannides en ennemi principal, quelle erreur : on est finalement plus dans un BTA au corps-Ã -corps qu'un vrai jeu de shoot (comparÃ© Ã  Space Marine 1 oÃ¹ l'on affrontait des orks).

Du coup, oubliez toute notion de prÃ©cision ou de headshots : les engagements sont toujours les mÃªmes avec des hordes de bestioles grouillantes qui vous foncent dessus, on balance deux, trois bastos Ã  distance pour dÃ©garnir les premiers rangs mais comme les ennemis sont de toute faÃ§on trop nombreux et rapides, que les tyrannides ""supÃ©rieurs"" sont trop rÃ©sistants (et que l'on est vite Ã  court de munitions en plus du rechargement qui prend une plombe), Ã§a finit invariablement par dÃ©fourailler Ã  l'Ã©pÃ©e tronÃ§onneuse avec quelques parades/esquives pas hyper intuitives.

Alors, c'est trÃ¨s fidÃ¨le au lore, hein. Mais c'est plat et redondant.

Et pourtant, j'ai envie d'aimer ce jeu, j'adore l'univers et tout mais au final c'est un peu la douche froide. Je lis les avis ici et lÃ  qui parlent du jeu de l'annÃ©e, d'un shooter Ã©pique etc... et je me demande si on joue bien au mÃªme jeu : Space Marine 2 n'est pas une bouse mais clairement Ã§a ne vaut pas tous les superlatifs qu'on entend sur lui et Ã§a ne vaut pas 60 â‚?non plus (et encore moins le prix en collector mais bon voilÃ , je me suis fait avoir, c'est la vie).



La campagne :
+ AgrÃ©able avec quelques moments de bravoure bien sentis
+ Un poil courte mais Ã§a reste convenable

- ZÃ©ro envie de la refaire une fois terminÃ©e

Le mode opÃ©rations :
+ Concept sympa qui reprend des passages de la campagne mais sous un angle diffÃ©rent
+ SystÃ¨me d'upgrade et d'arbre de talent sympa
+ Les diffÃ©rentes classes bien fichues et leur gameplay qui change un peu

- Un poil rÃ©pÃ©titif quand on monte plusieurs persos Lv 25
- Parer comme un dieu pendant 25 min, avoir 3 secondes d'inattention et se faire ouvrir en deux en niveau Ruthless, quel plaisir
- Les erreurs de connexion serveur trop frÃ©quentes, c'est vraiment pas sÃ©rieux

Le PVP:
+ Simple et efficace, Ã  l'ancienne
+ Accessible Ã  tous (hitboxes Ã©normes, pas de saut hors classe Assaut, Pas de glissade/couvert, 3 maps Ã  retenir...)
+ LÃ©gÃ¨re composante MOBA/Hero shooter sympa
+ Toutes les classes apportent un truc

- Matchmaking dÃ©bile qui met systÃ©matiquement les plus gros Lv ensemble VS les Lv 3
- On peut passer 2 jours Ã  ne pouvoir jouer que les Space Marine du chaos qui sont visuellement HORRIBLES/low poly/pas customizables (genre relancer le matchmaking entre chaque game et quand mÃªme finir cÃ´tÃ© Chaos, j'ai jamais vu un truc pareil...)
- Les gens qui se font farmer alors que le PVP est simplissime, les Tactical qui ne scannent jamais les ennemis, les coÃ©quipiers qui regardent la zone mais qui ne vont pas dessus, Ã§a rend fou (mÃªme si c'est pas la faute du jeu)
- Les respawns : un coup, c'est 3 secondes, un coup, c'est 8 secondes, au pif...

Au final, et avec les patchs, le jeu s'amÃ©liore doucement mais son Ã©tat actuel fait que c'est avant tout un jeu pour les fans de la licence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Product received for free

I've already gotten to play a quite a bit as I received early review access for my podcast, so I can confidently say this game is worth the time of any Warhammer fan. Saber did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of 40k - the setting, story, sound design, and overall atmosphere are all very well done with an emphasis on attention to detail. Plus they simply nailed both the look and the intensity of ""the swarm"" (much better than Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Helldivers, or even Doom).

Likewise, the combat never gets boring, as you chain endless combos of guns and melee into satisfying executions. The campaign is solid and can be played solo or co-op. The operations mode (which plays a bit more like Vermintide or Darktide missions) has endless ways to customize your character - both with gameplay perks and weapon upgrades, but also a nice cosmetic progression system. There are also class trials to hone your skills and try out the various flavor of marine that best suits your tastes.

I'm looking forward to checking out Eternal War (the PvP mode) now that the game has launched to the general public. All in all it's just a fun game you should get together with the boys and play (or just ride a bunch of cool elevators together, there are a lot in this game).

Note: The 21:9 support wasn't in when I tried it yet, so hoping that comes in the Day 1 patch, as well as a fov slider. I know you want us to feel like big hulking dudes right in the mix, but letting us pull out JUST a little bit might be good so I can see more of the big beautiful world of Warhammer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I cannot fathom in any way shape or form that Focus would decide that the game is entirely too easy. It comes as a very odd notion when you are constantly fighting an uphill battle for Armory Data, to become stronger, to make things easier. The entire premise of the games progression for operations was to complete operations, become stronger, and steamroll. What is the purpose of the entire progression system if the devs want to pull the rug out from beneath you? There genuinely isn't a good reason to have the entire progression system there in order to become stronger, just for the developers to decide that it's ""too easy"" and nerf everything. Genuinely the only people this system hurts is newer, non maxed out players. Because everyone with the maxed out weapons, perk trees, and levels already have the experience required to interchange their loadouts to make the game easier. It appalls me that a powerfantasy PVE game didn't see how these changes ruined Helldivers to a nigh irreparable state. Nerfing the Melta bomb, by SEVENTY PERCENT against the one boss people like saving it for? Ridiculous. Sure, some people on Youtube made it one-shot the Hive Tyrant. That doesn't mean that everyone plays like that. The fun thing about Space Marine 2 is build variety, and the more you nerf certain things the more that is taken away. To return to my former statement about Helldivers, that exact thing is what killed the game for me. I can't enjoy the game where I feel pressured to play the exact same way as everyone else because that is manageable and the way I like playing isn't. The game hasn't reached that point yet, thankfully. But this patch is a clear tell in that direction.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't really want to leave a negative review, the game really is good. But as a solo player going through the campaign on the recommended (albeit second hardest) difficulty, this game feels absolutely terrible to play. You have the two worst AI squad mates I have ever had the displeasure to call battle brothers, with the most useless and unforgiving ""armor"" system imaginable. Is it playable? Absolutely. Is it gratifying in difficulty to carry the bots through every mission while they exist only to throw some mostly ineffective bullets around and revive you (which will occur often)? No.

I do not even feel good getting better at the game sometimes, because it feels like I am competing against the actual combat system more than the enemies. So much of this game is made to be a flowing combat experience of dodging, slashing, and parrying, but often it just isn't. You get stuck in animations. You get notifiers of enemy attacks only like 1/3rd of the time. You get rewarded for parrying and playing it slow, but that just isn't effective when you're also getting swarmed by mooks that CHEW through you if you aren't constantly swinging, which paired with the aforementioned stuck in animations makes you take SO much unnecessary damage. Damage you barely heal from without wasting your ultimate with a lengthy cooldown, or frivolously utilizing the very scant med packs.

Rant aside, the game is genuinely good when it's good and when playing with actual people it's even better. Which is lucky considering the PvE and PvP are the main long term focus of the game. But as a solo player just enjoying the story at present, it is one of the worst experiences I have had playing a campaign.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finalmente un gioco che al lancio Ã¨ stabile, con contenuti e senza particolari bug che ne rovinano l'esperienza. Ho finito da poco la campagna, perfettamente in stile Warhammer, senza particolarissimi colpi di scena e molto lineare ma godibile da subito. Gameplay semplice ma rifinito e che da soddisfazioni. La modalitÃ  PvP Ã¨ uguale, semplice ma che riesce a coinvolgere, non Ã¨ troppo impegnativa ma se avete una squadra, potete togliervi soddisfazioni a livello tattico. Graficamente molto bello e devo dire, ottimizzato anche bene. GPU e CPU non vanno in ebollizione, tutto gira bene. Ripeto, erano anni che non si vedeva un gioco al day one senza problemi, un prodotto FINITO. Non la solita uscita che si rivela un mezzo casino tra server e ottimizzazione per poi scoprire che mancano pezzi, bisogna aspettare DLC e quanto altro. Io lo consiglio vivamente.

NOTA DOLENTE:

La campagna non ha matchmaking purtroppo quindi o avete un amico/a (che vi consiglio assolutamente, Ã¨ molto piÃ¹ divertente) oppure vi dovrete affidare ai bot che purtroppo, sono tutto fuorchÃ© intelligenti e in alcuni momenti, c'Ã¨ proprio da bestemmiare perchÃ© non riescono a dare prioritÃ  a nemici pericolosi e purtroppo vi capiterÃ  di morire malissimo anche un po' per colpa loro.

MINI TIP PER LA CAMPAGNA E PER LE OPERAZIONE (PVE):

In giro per la mappa, troverete delle casse VERDI con l'icona di una spada o qualcosa del genere, bene: DISTRUGGETELE, perchÃ© all'interno troverete colpi, stimolanti e a volte anche upgrade temporanei all'armatura. Sembra una cavolata ma quando l'ho casualmente scoperto, Ã¨ stata una bella salvata a livelli alti con i bot; sopratutto per gli stimolanti.

PER L'IMPERATORE!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Greetings dear friends, the first thing that should be said in the review of this game is its charismatic and heavy atmosphere, which introduces you very nicely to the environment and mood of war-torn areas. The artistic design of the stages and environments is done in the best way. The story of the game is in a good position, but it could have made your mind more involved by adding more and varied complications. But it ends in the best way. And the main pillar of the game is its gameplay. The variety of weapons and equipment for Destroying the new attackers is very well done. The fight scenes are extremely epic. The finishers. The special effects and the sequences of facing the bosses of the game. This charm is maintained until the end of the game. Although I went through the story section with my friends, But the artificial intelligence of the game is also in a good condition if you want to play alone. The online part of the game is very well done and can keep you more entertained. The flaws that can be found in the game are that the story part could be longer and the character development. Let's see a better one, but the character of Titus himself is great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of most climatic WH40K games to date, the maps are gorgeous and the attention to detail is immense.
You can really immerse yourself in the gargantuan scale of Imperial architecture and brutalism of the game universe, all those character interactions and background behaviours are very true to the lore.

Campaign is really well written and very fun with companions.

Coop PVE Operations are bread and butter of the game that deliver a heroic struggle experience, there is quite a large variety of weapons and playstyles that one can achieve from customization.
Just screw meltas. :)

I have yet to go full out in PVP but seems decent, just matchmaking needs to be improved (i.e. so you don't have total team level difference of 25 vs 60).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though I havenâ€™t spent many hours on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 yet, itâ€™s already clear that the shooting mechanics are satisfying, and the melee combat is a lotta fun. The gameâ€™s visuals are stunning, really bringing the warhammer universe to life. The campaign may be on the shorter side (around 8-10 hours) and somewhat average from what I've seen, but overall with its solid design and action," itâ€™s definitely worth the full price for any fan of the series.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and i do not like where the Patch Trend is going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

right now you require Armory Data (upgrade item) from Difficulty 3 and 4 if you wish to Upgrade your weapon and/or Advance the weapons Perktree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if you struggle on Dif. 2, you have to fight through an EVEN HARDER mission(Dif3) to upgrade your weapon to a point where you can enjoy Dif.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Perktree has the same issue, you need to unlock and max out each weapon in the Weaponclass to max out the Perks related tot he weapon. some of them completely altering attacks (Combat Knife) or adding additional Attacks (Thunder Hammer),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so to enjoy the weapon to the fullest you are forced to play a Dif you may not enjoy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a casual player who was challenged (in a good way) by higher difficulties before the recent nerf, I just have to say that I cant remotely understand why the developer decided to make the game harder.

I understand that there are players who have mastered all difficulties and for those players, a new, higher difficulty was implemented. Why punish those players who were fine with the game as it was? I sincerely hope lessons were learned from Helldivers.

To those who react to what I said above by telling me to ""get gud"" or leave the game:
I am still learning and I know I have much to learn still. But as said, Im just a casual dude who plays some operations in the evening with friends and not the best player out there. I wonder who those balance changes are aimed at: the elite of the best players who are bored or a larger portion of the player base.

Theres no denying it: I am severely pissed off. Just got my first fencing weapon, played some really intense operations and barely made it, only to get the thing that made it possible get nerfed the next day.

Also, from consuming content very experienced players created, I understand that once you have perfected your parry timing, you go back to balanced weapons anyways because of their better stats. So the best of the best arent even affected by that change. Its rather kicking away the crutch of those who need it. Telling them to just keep dying until they have perfected their timing. Which does not sound like fun progression. In a cooperative game anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was just playing a match that I hosted with two bots. Halfway through the mission a random player joins my lobby and moments later goes AFK before a checkpoint. ""No big deal"" I think after a minute of waiting ""it's my lobby, I'll just vote to kick him and since it's just the two of us the vote will immediately pass"". Nope, the game had given THEM ownership of the lobby I started and played half a mission in before they even showed up. I was literally a guest in a lobby I had started, a hostage to a host that had joined 15 minutes into the mission.

Good: production values are through the roof, love the presentation, music, vo, anims, all fire stuff
Really Bad: playing solo campaign on veteran and can barely get through any set pieces without dying 100 times and is not skill issue. They did not play their own game to see that combat, while looking great, is derpy af

Will talk about it on core, i hope they see this or hear it, I really like this game but the combat makes it hard to love. will edit review and switch to thumbs up once combat is fixed but I'm super tilted by the sloppy combat in this game.

1) getting pummeled at range while having no cover sucks and weâ€™re no dodge ninjas. Range damage should be hella lowered. I'm busy dealing with the problem in CQC. if they wanna pepper me while i'm in there -- fine. If they improve the health return mechanic maybe its less of an issue, but its just not fun getting peppered relentlessly while I'm in a scrum. I realize it maybe more realistic, but is video game who cares.

2) parry need to cancel current action and take priority over all other moves (except executes aka glory kills), and it needs to be generous with direction and timing. We have hoards of dudes crawling into our butts. It may not be realistic but it feels good video game wise â€?doom 2016 and eternal does this super well with glory kills. Doesnâ€™t matter if Iâ€™m reloading or scratching my nuts I press glory kill and I glory kill. Executes already does this in game, parries should do this as well

3) I find myself parrying even if there is no blue circle. Let parries just work â€?like Arkham games. the number of times a sword guy does an non-blue non-red attack and I parry only for the game to derp and I get hit anyway is massively aggravating. I could have been spamming attack, but when I spam attack, there's a blue circle and I'm in an attack anim and can't parry. This isn't some fighting game where misreads are punished. Let the players parry. The animations looks sick for it I want to spam the parry-gun shot follow up all freakin day man.

4) The game only lets you self heal on glory kill when you have white health. White health lasts like 0.000001 seconds. Get rid of white health, it's dumb. All executes should just self heal. This will let us tank the range damage we're getting pummelled by when we are in a melee scrum. Medkits can then and should be saved for ranged encounters (where executes aren't available).

5) Armor is weird and makes little sense. Make it one bar or just get rid of it. I don't remember needing it in SM1 and I'm not even sure what is does except go away quickly and never come back.

6) mission set pieces seem to be designed for 3 playersâ€?a) set piece mechanic b) hordes of melee c) ranged minions. In solo, I canâ€™t use 3 different weapons at the same time. Example is the rat fight -- I can't shoot the flame thrower, the ranged drones, and the damn sword guys all at the same time. The moment I swap to plasma gun/sword the rat turbines trip me on to the ground and do 1000000 damage. like did you need play these missions solo and go ""man sure seems like some cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ players will love this""

7) exacerbating this problem is the number of times I see ai teammates just standing there, or take a few pot shots at a baby tyrannid while a set piece mission objective is going up in smoke made me put down the game. Again, during rat missions there are drones that need to be taken out, and rats to keep at bay. Since the AI can't be bothered to use the flamethrower, I gotta keep rats at bay. What are my AI buddies doing? Shooting rats. Either make them be more effective at helping or make the set piece stuff make sense for solo play.

I actually love a lot about this game and want to play it more but combat and poor combat encounter design leaves too much to be desired right now and the game is frustrating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Un jeu qui respecte tout les codes de Warhammer 40K, si vous Ãªtes habituÃ©s aux Gears of Wars, alors vous serez pas dÃ©paysÃ©.

Points positifs :

Direction artistique fidÃ¨le Ã  l'univers.
Ambiance Ã©galement.
Beau graphiquement.
Gameplay agrÃ©able.

Points nÃ©gatifs que j'ai pu relever en difficultÃ© maximum :

DifficultÃ© pas trÃ¨s cohÃ©rente : se faire laver le fion par 200 rats tyranyde, bon voilÃ  quoi ...
Des niveaux linÃ©raires comme dans le 1 : On ne demandais certainement pas d'open world, mais des chemins multiples auraient Ã©tÃ© agrÃ©able.
Pas forcÃ©ment adaptÃ© aux petites configs, mais bon on est en 2024 on peux pas trop leurs en vouloir.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is how sequels should be. Take all that was good in the first game, improve on it, then add some new and cool features. Do not change what is already great. Give the core audience what it wants. Thus, create an excellent game.

Just an overall great game, the finishers are well made, the mechanics are well implemented, it provides a great power fantasy for any warhammer fan or a newcomer. only downsides are the stutters and lags which can be extremely annoying

(updated review)
game improved alot and added lots of stuff in it which is fun

La campaÃ±a es 10/10. Entras en el papel de Demtrian Titus, un space marine primaris... y eso es todo lo necesario para completar la campaÃ±a. Nada de builds, nada de talentos, nada de subir de nivel, nada de mejorar armas. Todas las armas sirven para cumplir la voluntad del emperador, aunque sÃ­ es posible utilizar diferentes tipos de armas durante las misiones.

Hay algunas misiones secundarias que complementan la historia principal y se pueden hacer en multijugador, o se pueden hacer completamente solo si eres como yo y no tienes con quiÃ©n jugar este gran juego.

Solo espero que en el futuro agreguen mÃ¡s misiones secundarias, o un DLC que extienda la campaÃ±a principal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simplemente hermoso, ahora que te resumÃ­ el juego en dos palabras hoy aprenderemos a hacer tortitas:

Ingredientes:
.-1 vaso leche
.-1 vaso harina
.-1 cucharada aceite de oliva virgen
.-1 cucharada generosa levadura Royal
.-1 poquito sal
.-1 cada azÃºcar avainillado
.-1 huevo

Pasos:

Paso 1
Batir muy bien el huevo. Yo batÃ­ primero la clara y luego la yema.
Paso 2
AÃ±adir todos los ingredientes en el bol y seguir batiendo sin parar. La masa irÃ¡ cogiendo fuerza y se harÃ¡ espesa.
Paso 3
Ponemos el bol con papel film y metemos 5 - 10 minutos en el congelador para no tener que dejar la masa reposando para que luego salgan esponjosas.
Paso 4
Mientras preparamos la sartÃ©n, el plato y la mantequilla.
Paso 5
Sacamos la masa. Pasamos un poco de mantequilla por la sartÃ©n con papel de cocina. Echamos una cucharada grande de masa en la sartÃ©n.
Paso 6
Esparcimos la masa hasta el tamaÃ±o que nos gusten (las tortitas).
Paso 7
Le damos la vuelta a la tortita, se dora por el otro lado yâ€?Al plato.
Paso 8
Hacemos esto cada vez hasta que nos quedemos sin masa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game is not well optimized at ALL. It takes forever to launch (over 10 min the first time, no joke). It crashed for me several times, even trying to change the settings made it crash for me. Definetly a refund at current state. I might come back to it later, but as for now it is not worth the price to have to deal with these issues.

Fun game play in the PVE but PVP has a bit of delay in lag like dying late. On another note If you cancel an operation you have to either leave barge or back out to title screen to get back in queue as if you directly try to start another operation it wont load people most of the time. But other than that fun dynamics although does need a healing/apothecary class for PVE or the option to heal a teammate. nothing like you having 2 stims and full health while your teammate is at deaths door and you cant help them out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game is fun, exceptionally so.
Thankfully the devs are walking back on trying to balance the game vastly into the ruinous power's favor. Still plagued with numerous issues from crashing, networking, matchmaking, and the like.

Some of the weakest weapons are receiving a small amount of attention, making it seem like they're not afraid of making the game too hard, but afraid of making it too fun.

Hopefully the perk systems are addressed, as a majority of the traits are either wrong to take against one of its competitors, or flat out not doing anything.

The worst part of the game is the class restricting matchmaking, tossing you into games where you possibly cannot play 2 of the classes, with no way to ensure you end up playing what you want, outside of maintaining a private lobby.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

O Universo de Warhammer 40k Ã© por essÃªncia um conjunto de 'coisinhas', E essas sÃ£o: Terror, TragÃ©dia, Brutalidade, Pancadaria, Carnificina e por aÃ­ vai..(JÃ¡ Deu pra Entender que os Fracos nÃ£o tem chance e nem vez), que fazem dele um universo Ãºnico. E essas 'coisinhas' sÃ£o um lembrete curto e grosso, 'NÃ£o hÃ¡ EsperanÃ§a e muito menos uma garantia de Paz'.

A excelente campanha Ã© uma continuaÃ§Ã£o direta do primeiro game, com uma trama muito boa e bem amarrada com as missÃµes Co-op mostrando de outro ponto as missÃµes lideradas por TITUS.
Aqui o Co-op brilha trazendo uma variedade de armas e classes de Space Marines para que possamos completar as missÃµes, que podem ser jogadas solo ou com mais dois amigos (com amigos Ã© melhor).
O multi-Jogador Ã© a extensÃ£o do Co-op para um PvP BRUTAL com vÃ¡rios modos. Game 10/10.

Os DEV's de Space Marine 2 estÃ£o de parabÃ©ns e tenhamos MÃXIMO RESPEITO, foram literalmente na direÃ§Ã£o ContrÃ¡ria de outros, que vem tentando empurrar essas "" Ideologias MÃ¡gicas"" medonhas goela abaixo nos players, E Todos sabemos que MÃ¡gica Ã© coisa de herege, E aqui apagamos o fogo da heresia na Paulada.

Esse jogo me proporcionou uma das melhores experiÃªncias com games em 2024!

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 nos entrega algo que estÃ¡ escasso hoje em dia: diversÃ£o e momentos de admiraÃ§Ã£o. Ã‰ daqueles jogos que te deixam arrepiado com seus cenÃ¡rios ricos e cheios de histÃ³ria. E jÃ¡ vamos comeÃ§ar por aÃ­: a ambientaÃ§Ã£o desse jogo Ã© incrÃ­vel! Recomendo, Ã s vezes, parar durante as fases e observar tudo ao seu redor. Parece que cada pedacinho diante de vocÃª tem uma histÃ³ria. Cada pedra, parede, e Ã¡rvore. Olhe para o cÃ©u, veja essas construÃ§Ãµes... parece que elas querem te contar algo que testemunharam hÃ¡ anos. Esse tipo de detalhamento Ã© raro nos jogos de hoje. Recentemente, li uma matÃ©ria sobre as pessoas envolvidas em Warhammer, e elas realmente demonstram entusiasmo com os projetos e criaÃ§Ãµes. EstÃ£o felizes fazendo isso. E, caso vocÃª nÃ£o saiba, Warhammer Ã© gigante, especialmente la na gringa.

Agora, vamos falar sobre a lore dessa franquia, que Ã© densa, cheia de histÃ³ria, personagens e cenÃ¡rios com um peso gigantesco, o que torna a obra ainda mais completa. Mas se vocÃª nÃ£o tem familiaridade com o universo ou ouviu falar pouco dele, nÃ£o se preocupe. Eu tambÃ©m nÃ£o tinha, comecei a me interessar recentemente, porque o jogo me proporcionou essa curiosidade. JÃ¡ existem excelentes criadores de conteÃºdo brasileiros abordando o tema. Space Marine 2 Ã© uma continuaÃ§Ã£o direta do primeiro jogo, onde controlamos o protagonista Titus. Mas nÃ£o se preocupe, nÃ£o Ã© necessÃ¡rio jogar o primeiro game. Se vocÃª quiser jogar, beleza, mas na minha opiniÃ£o, o segundo jogo Ã© uma excelente porta de entrada para esse universo gigantesco.

Sobre a jogabilidade: no comeÃ§o, os controles parecem confusos, mas com o tempo vocÃª se acostuma, e tudo cai como uma luva. O combate Ã© frenÃ©tico e desperta bastante adrenalina quando vocÃª enfrenta hordas de inimigos. Tudo isso enquanto grandes explosÃµes acontecem, o cÃ©u estÃ¡ recheado de inimigos e aeronaves em combate constante, e o cenÃ¡rio estÃ¡ desmoronando. Ã‰ uma verdadeira guerra.

A campanha Ã© ""curta"", mas tem o tamanho ideal para deixar aquele gostinho de ""quero mais"". Melhor assim do que ficar arrastada, cheia de enrolaÃ§Ã£o como muitos jogos por aÃ­ que tentam vender a ideia de uma campanha gigante. Na minha opiniÃ£o, ela estÃ¡ no ponto certo.

Em relaÃ§Ã£o ao desempenho, joguei no PC com uma configuraÃ§Ã£o mediana. Possuo uma RTX 2060 e posso dizer que fiquei sempre acima dos 70 FPS, usando o DLSS no modo qualidade. Fiz algumas pesquisas antes de adquirir o game e sÃ³ vi elogios quanto Ã  otimizaÃ§Ã£o. Sim, o jogo estÃ¡ bem otimizado e jÃ¡ prometeram melhorias em futuros updates. NÃ£o tenho muita informaÃ§Ã£o sobre o desempenho nos consoles, entÃ£o fico devendo.

Falando em updates, o jogo jÃ¡ tem um roadmap mostrando uma prÃ©via do que estÃ¡ por vir. Novas operaÃ§Ãµes, novos inimigos, armaduras, classes, armas, e muito mais.

A campanha pode ser jogada em coop com mais dois amigos. Mas o mais divertido de jogar em grupo sÃ£o as operaÃ§Ãµes. O jogo tambÃ©m tem um modo PvP, embora eu nÃ£o tenha jogado muito ainda. Vou explorar mais depois.

No geral, Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 estÃ¡ sendo uma experiÃªncia excelente, e eu recomendo demais! Ã‰ Ã³timo ver que ainda existem jogos assim. Se vocÃª tiver um dinheiro sobrando, compre e se divirta!

Pelo Imperador!

[BLOP] Misanthropy-AU,Not Recommended,125.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006448215/,"Posted: September 6
Cannot recommend the game in it's current release state.

Pros first off, followed by cons.

1: the game actually runs well at high framerates, optimization isn't a big issue here.

2: Gunplay & TTK are good. Recoil can be felt, guns feel good to use. not some shoddy CoD shooter with 0.2s hipfire spray TTK. The Player's ability to aim well is rewarded here.

3: The game's audio feels meaty, heavy and (relatively) realistic & believable.

4: PvE Melee combat. can't say much about it because i prefer to shoot things, but it works well in PvE. feels like they've combined valheim with dark souls.

5: Customization. Follows pretty closely from space marine 1 but with further improvements. Some of the best of any Warhammer game i've played.

6: Environment. The maps are pretty with effort and work put into them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons.

1: PvE Co-op/Campaign ques are still bugged for me personally, though they work for most people. i am unable to start any PvE or campaign game of my own due to the bug of being left on the battle barge with no UI after a black screen. - The solution proposed by a comment in the review Does work, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still bugged.
(Edit 9/09/2024)

2: PvP Que limitations. can only bring at most two friends into PvP. on the upside you can't guild stack PvP lobbies.

3: PvP Class Balance: i'm just gonna say it. mid at best. at higher levels the JPA's practically worthless. The Bulwark's relegated to using their flag ability and is otherwise worthless. Melee's just plain bad.

4: Lack of content. the main campaign is extremely short taking only a few hours to complete. There are 8 replayable PvE operations which is where the bulk of this game's content is. Shares similarities to killing floor where the only differences are as you get stronger via weapon upgrades, class & weapon perks, you simply up the difficulty instead of doing something new. if you don't care much for that, you could play through all of the game's content within half a day.
on a personal level i preferred the wave survival of the first space marine. less walking, less talking. more shooting.

5: PvE AI Squaddies. while they do have some nice features like leaving executes for the player when the bot doesn't need the armor regeneration, they overall fall short. they're not great at fighting back against the hordes, and most of the time don't cover you when your stuck doing objectives that leave you defenceless.

6: Class selection limitations - Done for balance reasons that i can certainly understand, however there's no support for people that want to play a specific class. No ability to pre-select the class you desire to play prior to queuing, and having MM filtered to suit your selection.

7: Easy Anti-Cheat. it's awful and players have already cracked it. Players running around with infinite grenades & trainer like cheats etc.

8: Lack of Shoulder camera swap for PvP. It's all about right angle peaks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TL:DR - Overall it's a solid core game. once the release bugs get ironed out and some more content comes out i could definitely recommend this. just not in it's current release state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autant Ãªtre honnÃªte, c'est la premiÃ¨re Ã©valuation que je fais de ma vie sur Steam. Mais j'y suis bien obligÃ©. Je me suis pris une claque MONUMENTALE.

Que dire. N'Ã©tant qu'aux prÃ©mices de l'HÃ©rÃ©sie d'Horus, j'avais quelques rÃ©serves quand Ã  ce jeu : ne pas pouvoir profiter pleinement de l'univers et de ce qu'il avait Ã  proposer. Ne pas tout comprendre. Quelle erreur. C'est beau, c'est bien fait, c'est efficace.

Ce jeu prend tout son sens en multijoueur : affronter des lÃ©gions d'hÃ©rÃ©tiques ou des hordes de xÃ©nos avec de parfaits inconnus, ou des amis, c'est le pied TOTAL. On en redemande, et on en Ã  JAMAIS assez de faire exploser des cranes d'aliens Ã  coup de bolters. On est surpuissant, mais trÃ¨s vite submergÃ©. Relever un alliÃ© au sol avant de repartir au combat a ses cotÃ©s n'a jamais Ã©tÃ© aussi Ã©pique. La sensation de tir est jouissive. Les finish sont bien gore, et on adore dÃ©couper en deux ce qui nous tombe sous le gantelet Ã©nergÃ©tique.

Toujours lutter de toutes ses forces jusqu'au dernier ennemi, par ce qu'Ã  l'arrivÃ©e, il y a toujours quelque chose Ã  dÃ©bloquer. Une couleur, un Ã©lÃ©ment d'armure, une amÃ©lioration d'arme. Cela faisait des annÃ©es, pour moi, que je n'avais plus connu ce lÃ©gendaire ""aller, une derniÃ¨re partie"". Et Ã§a marche, par ce que l'on fini toujours par en relancer une.

C'est addictif. C'est un chef d'oeuvre en la matiÃ¨re. Space Marine 2, Saber et Focus donnent une sacrÃ© leÃ§on aux autres studios qui, depuis quelques annÃ©es, se reposent sur des acquis bancals et sur des lauriers devenus immÃ©ritÃ©s.

On ne peut que IMPLORER Ã  genoux le studio d'entretenir son jeu, d'apporter des nouveautÃ©s et des ajouts rÃ©guliers, car des pÃ©pites pareilles, ce n'est pas tout les jours que Ã§a sort sur le devant de la scÃ¨ne vidÃ©o ludique.

Tirons notre chapeau Ã  Saber Interactive et Ã  Focus Entertainment. Du fond du cÅ“ur, MERCI. Merci pour le poulet. Merci pour les travaux. Quelle grÃ¢ce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Te lo dirÃ© asi de claro, este es el mejor juego de Warhammer 40K.
Tienes un modo historia divertido y rejugable gracias a sus 4 niveles de dificultad, que demÃ¡s te lo puedes hacer en cooperativo con 2 amigos.
Y cuando acabes la historia el modo pvp te va a encantar ya que hay 5 tipos de marine jugables en 3 modos de juego diferentes.
Si no te gusta el pvp puedes jugar con tus amigos el modo pve que se llama operaciones en el que libras unas pequeÃ±as batallas contra la cpu.

La experiencia de warhammer definitiva.

Gameplay excelente en todos los aspectos, no es el mÃ¡s innovador pero a estas alturas importa que sea divertido a que inventen algo raro. No hace falta que sea super ingenioso para que sea excelente. Si es divertido y funciona muy bien. Es excelente para uno

La IA algunas veces se cae a pedazos. Y mÃ¡s te das cuenta cuando te tumban y tenes que esperar, ahÃ­ donde mÃ¡s tus ojos estÃ¡n es en esperar a que vengan a levantarte y te das cuenta que la IA es bastante floja y se traba y quedan por estÃ¡ticos en algunas ocasiones

El resto de perla. Si jugÃ¡s con amigo no hay cosas malas solo buenas. Tan bueno que el punto negativo que tiene te lo podes sacar de encima

TambiÃ©n me gusta volver a recalcar que no hace falta ser super novedoso e ingenioso para tener un gameplay fenomenal y muy divertido. Y es lo que es este juego, como helldivers,etc

Lo simple funciona, no siempre tengo ganas de ver que equiparme, subir,etc para querer
jugar, esto va al grano, melee, pistola,arma que mÃ¡s te guste y te vas a la guerra por el emperador",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gameplay ist gut und das Spiel overall macht SpaÃŸ, aber hat VIEL zu wenig Content...
War nach ~9h durch die Kampagne durch und der Multiplayer-Part besteht aus 5 kleinen Missionen die man nur immer wieder von vorne spielen kann... (und sonst PVP).

Qualitativ ein gutes Spiel, aber fÃ¼r das bisschen Content viel zu teuer.
30â‚?sind die 10h Spielzeit schon wert, aber alles darÃ¼ber ist einfach zu viel =/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J'aurais vraiment souhaitÃ© pouvoir y jouer mais le jeu ne me laisse pas l'essayer ...

SincÃ¨rement, premier problÃ¨me rencontrÃ© : je dois relancÃ© le jeu systÃ©matiquement parce que le Launcher Epic Games pose problÃ¨me ... (EOS-IN-FF-403) Je suis forcÃ© de FORCER l'arrÃªt du jeu pour le relancer systÃ©matiquement si je souhaite que le jeu se lance rÃ©ellement.
Une fois le jeu lancÃ© une seconde fois, il faut 15 minutes pour accÃ©der au menu.
On pourrait se dire que bon, arrivÃ© ici, c'est bon, on va y arriver ... mais NON, je lance une nouvelle partie ... le temps de chargement est horriblement long, puis dÃ¨s que la cinÃ©matique d'ouverture est sensÃ©e dÃ©marrer, on entend le son, mais en rÃ©alitÃ© tout dÃ©file Ã  10 SPF (Oui j'ai bien dit SPF : Second Per Frame) ...
Une fois la cinÃ©matique ""terminÃ©e"" pour ce que j'ai pu en profiter en rÃ©alitÃ© ... L'Ã©cran reste noir avec Ã©crit ""ConnectÃ© : mon_pseudo"" en haut Ã  gauche ...

Pour ce qui est de mon matÃ©riel, je satisfait Ã  la configuration ""recommandÃ©e"",

About a month after Helldivers 2 launched, Arrowhead released a patch that made their game punishingly difficult and it was suddenly no longer accessible or fun to me, so I and many others quit. Their daily active players dropped off sharply after that. Saber has now done the exact same thing that Arrowhead did.

Substantial difficulty is now harder than Ruthless was before the patch with all the Extremis spawns and other tweaks. Ruthless and Lethal difficulties are inaccessible to someone like me who doesn't have the time to no-life the game and ""git gud."" That leaves me without the ability to progress, and without that I have no incentive to continue playing.

It was fun while it lasted. It's too bad this trend of Dark Souls difficulty fetishism is ruining games. What used to be recreational fun time is now far too intense and serious business. No thanks. I already have a difficult and stressful day job. I don't want or need a difficult and stressful game. I'm too old for that and I'd bet a lot of other 40k fans are, too.

Edit: Todays patch was almost everything I could have hoped for. Saber has proven (at least for now) that they actually listen to their customers and care more about whether we have fun than making sure their game is a torturously difficult Elitists Only gatekeeper circle **** like Helldivers 2 became. The rapid response and decision to roll back poorly designed and hastily implemented changes, with a few reasonable caveats, is appropriate and has returned the game to a state of play that is accessible enough to be inviting and enjoyable and challenging enough to be replayable. With that, Space Marine 2 has earned my positive review and recommendation, but I want to leave off my revised review with some words of caution:

Part of my afformentioned stressful job involves data analysis. Space Marine 2 is a great game that was almost ruined by poor decision making based on what I can only describe as poor analysis. Dmitriy Grigorenko, the Space Marine 2 Game Director, says in the 4.1 patch notes, ""Here was our reasoning before Patch 4.0: When the game came out in September, the Ruthless difficulty win rate hovered around 60%. Weeks later, and with the changes introduced by Patch 3.0, we saw that the same win rate had jumped to over 80%, and we received a lot of feedback stating that the game had become too easyâ€”even at its maximum difficulty (at the time)."" Okay. Win Rate by Difficulty alone is a terrible way to determine whether or not a game is unbalanced unless you are also tracking the overall played time of the specific players involved, the weapons they are using, and the degrees and extents to which they've upgraded their class and weapon perks. Of course win rates on Ruthless jumped by 20% over a few weeks! The players were learning the game, learning the enemies, learning where all the equipment spawns, and progressively unlocking more powerful weapons and abilities! A full team of maxed out players (level 25 with fully upgraded Relic weapons) with over 100 hours played consistently beating the game on the highest difficulty should not be surprising or concerning. It should be expected. On the other hand, a full team of newer players leveling and unlocking their first class and weapon set should find it challenging, but not impossible. Saber seems to have looked at and listened to only the most hardcore addicted players and started tuning the game for that small but vocal group of presumably unemployed extreme gamers who compulsively devoured what was meant to be hundreds of hours of content and then whined when the game we were all still learning and progressing through wasn't hard enough for them anymore after they memorized and mastered every aspect of a game that most of the player base were just beginning to explore. As a result, Saber made PvE progression for newer and more casual players impossible (or at least prohibitively difficult) for a week. That's a really dumb thing for a smart team of developers to do.

I don't know how much data Saber is collecting or the different ways that they may or may not be analyzing that data, but this bit of insight from the Game Director is concerning without additional context. At least they did the right thing by rolling back their and they didn't take forever to do it. Hopefully they will make good on their promise to be more measured in their approach to balancing the game going forward by listening to feedback from more than just the most hyper-aggressive terminally-online game junkies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AnÃ¡lise totalmente voltada para a CAMPANHA do jogo!

Este jogo Ã© uma obra que vai alÃ©m de ser apenas um jogo de tiro ambientado no espaÃ§o. Ao entrar na pele de um dos guerreiros mais temidos e respeitados do ImpÃ©rio, senti ao longo do jogo, o fervor que transcende o simples ato de lutar. O jogo me fez sentir como se estivesse em uma verdadeira cruzada, em nome da humanidade, evocando um sentimento de patriotismo e um desejo inato de lutar e de morrer pela luta!

A experiÃªncia foi especialmente impactante nÃ£o apenas pela jogabilidade visceral e brutal (Que vocÃªs todos sabem que tem sido muito raro hoje em dia, tendo apenas Helldivers 2 apresentado algo semelhante ultimamente), mas pelo forte vÃ­nculo que se desenvolve entre o protagonista e os NPCs que fazem parte dos seu esquadrÃ£o, que realmente sÃ£o tÃ£o herÃ³is quanto o protagonista, nÃ£o se limitando apenas a personagens secundÃ¡rios que observam o protagonista fazer tudo. Mesmo sendo o foco principal da narrativa, a intensidade com que os NPCs lutavam ao meu lado Ã© tÃ£o grande quanto a minha. Os gritos de guerra, suas demonstraÃ§Ãµes de lealdade e coragem em combate, e a forma como se sacrificam sem hesitar criam uma atmosfera de irmandade inabalÃ¡vel que me emergiu muito dentro do jogo. Em muitos momentos, nÃ£o me senti apenas como o herÃ³i, mas como uma parte pequena de algo maior â€?uma fraternidade de guerreiros unidos por um propÃ³sito comum: proteger a humanidade a qualquer custo.

Os Space Marines nÃ£o sÃ£o personagens comuns, e o jogo retrata isso de maneira impressionante. Cada um deles Ã© uma forÃ§a da natureza, nÃ£o apenas em termos de habilidades, mas na forma como se entregam completamente ao combate e Ã  missÃ£o. Esse aspecto Ã© particularmente poderoso, pois me fez sentir que a responsabilidade da vitÃ³ria nÃ£o recaÃ­a apenas sobre meus ombros, mas era compartilhada com cada soldado ao meu redor. A fÃºria deles antes de batalhas decisivas, e a vontade implacÃ¡vel e infinita de continuar lutando, mesmo diante de adversidades insanas, me fizeram sentir que eu era parte de uma causa muito maior do que eu mesmo.

Deixando de lado o que mais me tocou emoÃ§Ã£o neste jogo, agora falo dos grÃ¡ficos detalhados que tambÃ©m ajudou a amplificar essas emoÃ§Ãµes. Cada cenÃ¡rio era certamente muito lindo (Tirava muitos prints ao longo das fases), desde os mundos devastados pela guerra atÃ© os sombrios corredores das fortalezas inimigas.

A combinaÃ§Ã£o desses elementos criou uma experiÃªncia que eu nÃ£o havia Ã¡ muito tempo, e acredito que muitos aqui entendem que nÃ£o sentem Ã¡ muito tempo, que Ã© aquela vontade de jogar algo o dia inteiro, gostar cada minuto, e quando acaba, ficamos ""JÃ¡ acabou?"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cuando THQ y Relic Entertainment lanzaron Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine en septiembre del 2011, el juego fue muy bien recibido (sobre todo por los usuarios de PC) a falta de tÃ­tulos de acciÃ³n en tercera persona al estilo God of War durante esa Ã©poca. Diez aÃ±os despuÃ©s, Focus Entertainment y el desarrollador Saber Interactive anunciaron su secuela Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 durante The Game Awards 2021, marcando el regreso de Demetrius Titus a la Segunda CompaÃ±Ã­a de los Ultramarines, pero esta vez como teniente, no como CapitÃ¡n.

Para aquellos que no lo recuerden como tambiÃ©n para quienes no jugaron su previa entrega, Titus es reportado por su compaÃ±ero Leandros al final del primer juego por sospechas de herejÃ­a luego de que el honorable capitÃ¡n sobreviviera a una explosiÃ³n de Warp, lo cual es muy poco comÃºn entre los Adeptus Astartes. A raÃ­z del recelo de su compaÃ±ero, Titus se ve obligado a someterse a la pesquisa de la InquisiciÃ³n (para no manchar la reputaciÃ³n de los Ultramarines), pero esta no logra encontrar nada.

Con esto en mente, Space Marine 2 comienza con Titus sirviendo como un Escudo Negro en el singular CapÃ­tulo de los VigÃ­as de la Muerte (Deathwatch), la cual estÃ¡ compuesta por veteranos experimentados de otras facciones para combatir especies extraterrestres. Luego de mÃ¡s de cien aÃ±os de servicio, Titus recibe una herida fatal y renace como un Primaris (un Space Marine mÃ¡s Ã¡gil, fuerte y resistente) luego de Â«cruzar el RubicÃ³nÂ», una frase utilizada como punto de no retorno en la cirugÃ­a de transformaciÃ³n de estas gigantes mÃ¡quinas de matar de dos metros y medio. No obstante, no hay diferencias tangibles entre el Titus del prÃ³logo y aquel convertido en Primaris.

A pesar de su gran devociÃ³n por servir al Emperador y su desempeÃ±o intachable en el nombre del mismo, Titus es recibido nuevamente por sus hermanos azules con cierta desconfianza por las infundadas conjeturas de herejÃ­a del pasado, ademÃ¡s de tener que rendir cuenta de sus acciones durante las misiones ya que no siempre siguen al piÃ© de la letra el Codex Astartes, la doctrina por la cual se rigen todos los Marines Espaciales.

SerÃ­a el equivalente de un cristiano que sabe interpretar la biblia en tiempos modernos, en vez de estar citando ciegamente palabra por palabra algunos de sus versÃ­culos como un fanÃ¡tico religioso. La voz de Titus, ahora interpretada por Clive Standen en vez de Mark Strong, me pareciÃ³ que encaja mucho mejor con la templanza del personaje, como tambiÃ©n en los momentos en que decide actuar segÃºn lo que le parece correcto.

Similar a Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine en el cual primero luchÃ¡bamos contra los Orkos y luego los Chaos Space Marines, en esta secuela el enemigo en principio serÃ¡n los TirÃ¡nidos, pero ya en instancias iniciales de la campaÃ±a, los Marines Traidores y su maliciosa energÃ­a del Warp serÃ¡n una vez el archirrival de los Ultramarines. QuizÃ¡s algunos me odian por este spoiler, pero esto no es necesariamente informaciÃ³n nueva. De hecho, un trailer extendido de gameplay de agosto del 2023 (acompaÃ±ado de nuevas imÃ¡genes bastante explÃ­citas) ya revelaban a la facciÃ³n de Los Mil Hijos (Thousand Sons), quienes actÃºan al servicio del Dios del Caos, Tzeentch.

Todo esto dejando de lado el hecho de que el juego completo de Space Marine 2 se filtrÃ³ a mediados de julio de este aÃ±o, incluyendo no solo la campaÃ±a sino tambiÃ©n archivos para crear servidores online. Una verdadera catÃ¡strofe para el estudio. No obstante, si bien se creÃ­a que la build era de junio de este aÃ±o, representantes de Saber Interactive dijeron que era mucho mÃ¡s antigua que eso, y se pone en evidencia por la falta de escaladores (DLSS de Nvidia y FSR2 de AMD) e incluso el TAA, que sÃ­ estÃ¡n en el juego final.

Similar a su predecesor, Space Marine 2 cuenta con un gameplay que combina combate cuerpo a cuerpo con ejecuciones al estilo God of War, con la cÃ¡mara y el gunplay caracterÃ­sticos de la saga Gears of War, ahora mucho mÃ¡s refinados. Si bien la fÃ³rmula sigue siendo la misma, la secuela introduce algunas mecÃ¡nicas que lo hacen mÃ¡s frenÃ©tico, sangriento y brutalmente satisfactorio, en gran parte gracias al excepcional trabajo en las animaciones que ahora son mucho mÃ¡s fluidas y realistas, y no tienen nada que envidiarle a Kratos en el reboot de God of War del 2018.

Por un lado, Titus ahora no solo puede bloquear ataques y esquivarlos con un dodge (los rojos no se pueden bloquear), sino tambiÃ©n hacer un parry a enemigos de tamaÃ±o normal, o ejecuciones instantÃ¡neas cuando se trata de enemigos pequeÃ±os, que son bÃ¡sicamente los Hormagaunts que aparecen de a cientos en pantalla.

El parry, marcado con un halo celeste, no solo nos sirve para evitar un ataque, sino tambiÃ©n para estampar a los enemigos mÃ¡s pequeÃ±os contra el piso en pos de despejar un poco el Ã¡rea en caso de estar rodeado de decenas de ellos. Igual de importante es utilizar el golpe pesado (que se ejecuta manteniendo el clic derecho al final de un combo) para hacer un pisotÃ³n en el piso o otros golpes de gran magnitud segÃºn el arma que tengamos equipada (lamentablemente no estÃ¡ la Power Axe, pero si un cuchillo que brinda mucha velocidad).

Similar a Space Marine, la barra de armadura se regenera automÃ¡ticamente o al realizar ejecuciones, ya sean cuerpo a cuerpo o con la pistola. La salud por otro lado, ya no se cura con finishers, sino que debemos obtener medkits y usarlos. Tanto estos como las cajas de municiones pueden estar ocultos en cajas, asÃ­ que romper un poco los objetos del escenario no estÃ¡ de mÃ¡s. No suelen abundar demasiado de modo que hay que racionarlos sabiamente como en Left 4 Dead o el otro juego desarrollado por Saber Interactive, World War Z.

En caso de recibir mucho daÃ±o y que un porcentaje de la barra de vida estÃ© en blanco, Titus puede recuperar un poco al golpear a enemigos hasta llegar al color rojo. Es una mecÃ¡nica de riesgo y recompensa, sobre todo en dificultades altas. Como Ãºltimo recurso, podemos activar la Furia de Titus (la cual que tambiÃ©n estaba en el primer Space Marine) para regenerar un poco de vida y realizar ataques con mayor daÃ±o y velocidad. Los compaÃ±eros de Titus (Chairon y Gadriel) tambiÃ©n tienen sus propias habilidades activas y pasivas, que definitivamente sirven a la hora de jugar en cooperativo y/o en altas dificultades.

Habiendo jugado la campaÃ±a primero en normal y despuÃ©s en difÃ­cil (Veterano), recomiendo jugarlo en esta Ãºltima o la mÃ¡s difÃ­cil de todas en caso de que busquen un desafÃ­o mÃ¡s significativo. La dificultad Normal es demasiado fÃ¡cil y es muy raro -pero no imposible- morir si estamos acostumbrados a este tipo de juegos. Nuestros compaÃ±eros del squad nos pueden resucitar hasta dos veces antes de recibir una herida mortal (que en caso de caer nuevamente moriremos y tendremos que reiniciar el checkpoint) lo cual lo hace aÃºn mÃ¡s indulgente. La campaÃ±a, a lo largo de cinco extensas misiones en los planetas Kadaku, Avarax y Demerium, tiene una duraciÃ³n promedio de 10 horas de juego.

No hay mucho valor de rejugabilidad excepto por los modos de dificultad o en caso de querer ayudar a algÃºn amigo. TambiÃ©n estÃ¡ la posibilidad de querer desbloquear el logro de los 32 dataslates (audiologs), para lo cual es necesario jugar la campaÃ±a como tambiÃ©n el modo PvE. Lamentablemente no se pueden elegir los checkpoints de las misiones, de modo que si queremos jugar un segmento en particular, tendremos que empezar la misiÃ³n de cero.

The Developers have zero respect for their player base, they treat us as test subjects not customers. What is this patch 4.0? Are you seriously punishing your player base for having fun and enjoying the game from before? Are trying to role-play a Greek God?

1. You stealth nerfed the dodge distance and invulnerability window, now my space marine felt like he is overweight and hasn't exercise in years. The distance traveled felt unnatural even to the naked eye, its like my character hit an invisible wall as he jumped. The fact that the Developers kept this from us is a big red flag.

2. The new teammate distance mechanic on ruthless and lethal has never been tested before release, you can tell they never take snipers into consideration at all, how can they play their role as range support if they cannot stay back and provide cover fire. And why implement this to ruthless, if you want to provide a challenge for the elites among us, this mechanic should only be in lethal difficult if ever. This is clearly Hubris on the Developers part, and the success of Space Marine 2 have gone to their head.

3. Your current Operation enemy director is not functioning as intended, enemy spawn rate is all over the place even on low difficult. 6 to 7 Majoris drowning a single level 1 to 3 player on Minimal is crazy (I have encounter this multiple times when joining a game). How are new players able to learn if they are getting hammered from the very beginning.

4. Enemies are still able to shoot at my feet and damage me through the elevator floor, imagine getting sniped from underneath the floor plate by a Tyranid 5 secs after the elevator has already left the previous floor. This has been an issue from day one, 4 patches in and still not fix. I do not wish to dodge around like an idiot in the elevator, so how about you fix this immersion breaking bug asap.

5. Lastly I am extremely disappointed with the cosmetic rewards for clearing all 7 missions on lethal. One helmet for all 6 classes? Why not one for each class, the design on that helmet took your team how long to make? An hour? Two? You could have move that damaged look to all of the relic helmets, one for each class, how lazy have you gotten, I have already purchase the season pass, unfortunately in this case, honestly i don't think I will be getting my money's worth if this is the amount of effort for such an achievement.

This review will not effect the current sales of this game, but keep this type of updates and lazy work going, and the next time i see a Saber Interactive game, I will pick any other developers who respects their player base to support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The picture is pretty good. If you look closely, you can see that the character's face is rough. The one with the red helmet was paralyzed all day long, but overall it's passable.

Effect sound: monotonous sound of gunfire, unqualified

Shooting, close combat, not enough impact
I'm a Astartes. I hold a bolter in my hand and shoot away the weakest insect with one shot. Isn't it reasonable that you won't give me such an effect? If you think the insect is not a threat enough, just add more mobs and shoot them for me. ...
But I did a good job in executing, parrying, dodging, etc.

The single-player campaign, plot, and level design are all considered passable.
Several levels, such as the scene with the swarm of swallowing insects, are impressive.
Moreover, after changing the production company, there are still some parts that pay tribute to the previous spacemarine1 (leaving it for everyone to discover when they play)

However, there are still many pain points. The following shortcomings are included in the cooperation mode of END GAME.

Start vomiting next

The hardness of medium-sized elite enemies is unreasonable. It takes almost an entire magazine of bullets to kill an ordinary elite monster.

However, when arranging the spawning of monsters, sometimes 7-8 elites can appear at once, rushing across the entire formation and killing the entire team in an instant. Moreover, the TTK specialties of ordinary elites cannot be cleared quickly.

If you don't want to be slaughtered, you have to hit me with a supermodel's melta gun.

And you asked me to use one magazine to shoot an elite, but you gave me insufficient ammunition?!?!?! The bolter has 210 rounds of ammunition?!?!?!?!

The guns obtained in the cooperative mode cannot keep up with the improvement of monsters at each level. Unless you get a new gun and reach a low difficulty level, otherwise, there will be no happy feedback from upgrading when you get a new gun and reach a new level.
The effect of the character specialization tree is not obvious. Can you please learn from Warhammer40K:Darktide ??

There are many unreasonable skills in the weapon specialization tree. The knife needs to kill 10 enemies in a row before it can be activated. How to kill??!?!

All of the above are fundamentally unsatisfying points.
It makes people wonder if the producers have ever played their own games.

The following is a complaint about the design

The level route is completely single and there is not even the slightest bit of explorability (of course the producer doesnâ€™t have any collectibles...)
And there are only 6 MAP to play. Where is your sincerity??? Look at Remnant2 next to it?!!?!?

If you do this cooperative mode and have a bunch of appearance collections, you might as well get some equipment for us to grind...

And why are there only 3 people in a team?!?! Do you know how many people a team is instructed by the Codex Astartes?!?!
Anyway, letâ€™s give it to 4 of us together!!!!!

I can't even play the game all of my time has been just trying to get in. Most importantly it frequently crashes on the opening cinematic and just opens with a black screen. I hope they patch some fixes to this so I can play, because right now I've basically wasted my money at this point.

Edit: Once it was fixed, this game has become a real blast. I really do think sometimes starts are always rough, but sometimes it does get fixed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm going to be honest here, i'm on the fence about this game!

i love 40k and have been anticipating this game for so long.

The campaign is short but cinematic AF. Visuals, game play, the sound is all on point!

The PVP just feels meh to me, it doesn't really offer much at the moment.

So the reason i'm on the fence, Whats going to keep me coming back for more?
I mean, i've completed the campaign and the side missions. So basically all that's left for me to do is rinse and repeat on higher difficulties to level up my brother, for what? So i can just log in and be like, wow he looks awesome. For me the eternal war should of been more like a hell divers type of mode, drop in and defend planets from different races. just hoping that they bring in some new modes to keep it playable.

Well that's my view anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For almost a decade, I wished for a sequel to Space Marine.

I was afraid it would never happen. THQ crashing and burning had left the possibility of a true sequel in limbo. In spite of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, and a fairly large cult following, I had doubt that anyone would pick up the ball, and finish what Relic started.

Then, to my shock, a couple years ago, a trailer drops.

I wanted to shout for joy, but almost instantly, I became skeptical.

Worried that my beloved game could never have the sequel it deserved in our current development culture. The new studio would gut it of what made it's soul, insert contrived modern tropes and disrespect the source and setting.

I have NEVER been so happy to be wrong.

Space Marine 2 is Marvelous. Jaw-Dropping.

Saber has taken Relics Masterpiece to new heights, added new mechanics that enhance the experience and expanded the multiplayer, seamlessly weaving it into the campaign, making it far more interesting and addictive that it's predecessor.

It's BIGGER, BLOODIER and even more BAD*SS.

Titus' story continues, wonderfully connected to the previous installment, ending it's chapter with a promise of more, and leaving me READY for the next sequel. SM2 NAILS the vibe of Warhammer 40k, outright stunning at few moments. The setting and the previous game are treated with reverence and attention to detail.

For hours, I lost myself, engaged, immersed and awestruck at the spectacle, even more so because I had come to believe it would never happen.

Bravo, Saber, Focus, GW and Everyone who made this happen.

Bon...
Je tiens Ã  prÃ©ciser que j'apprÃ©cie Ã©normÃ©ment la licence. J'ai poncÃ© le premier opus plus jeune, je dÃ©vore les romans, j'aime peindre et jouer sur table. Tout Ã§a pour dire que j'avais de grandes attente et Focus et Saber ont su faire monter la hype.

J'ai prÃ©-commandÃ© le jeux en version Gold sur Pc, Rtx2070, i7-10 etc...
J'ai maintenant 40h de jeux.

Spoil : je ne le recommande pas...

Okay ! le jeux est bien. L'univers est bien rendu. On prend part Ã  de belles batailles. Les combats sont dynamique, c'est gore, il y a du lore, de la personnalisation etc...

Mais... Beaucoup trop de points nÃ©gatif.

En solo dÃ©jÃ  la campagne est trop courte. Douche froide Ã  la derniÃ¨re mission. Quelques heures de plus aurait Ã©tÃ© bienvenue pour un projet de cet envergure extrÃªmement attendu. Les scÃ©nariste ont fait un boulot propre, ressemblant aux bouquins mais c'est tout.
Le Gameplay par contre a Ã©tÃ© vraiment mal foutu et brise complÃ¨tement l'immersion.
Des murs invisible sur notre chemin. PressÃ© une touche plus d'une seconde pour ramasser un objet ou activer un bouton. ÃŠtre obligÃ© de se taper deux ligne de dialogue avant d'ouvrir une porte...
Niveau combat c'est de l'arÃ¨ne. On se met au milieu et on encaisse. Aucune stratÃ©gie, pas de couvert. un systÃ¨me extrÃªmement bancal de bouclier, rÃ©gÃ©nÃ©ration, exÃ©cution, parade qui n'a pas de synergie. Pas de systÃ¨me d'upgrade de notre hÃ©ros. Certains ennemis deviennent une vraie purge et la masse ne sert pas Ã  grand chose si ce n'est mettre le bordel Ã  l'Ã©cran.

La Coop... Bon ! C'est super cool de pouvoir jouer les missions parallÃ¨le de l'aventure principal. Par contre oÃ¹ sont les autres missions ? 6 c'est tout ?? Un systÃ¨me d'upgrade qui m'a empli les yeux de larmes aprÃ¨s mettre rendu compte qu'il faudrait faire en boucle des missions scÃ©narisÃ© que je n'ai vraiment pas envie de recommencer. Surtout qu'il n'y a pas de lien entre le PvE et PvP...

Le PvP... J'en attendais Ã©normÃ©ment. Je pensais mÃªme qu'il foirerai la campagne pour se focaliser dessus... Ba non. Le systÃ¨me de progression est vraiment mal pensÃ©. Les classe me paraissent dÃ©sÃ©quilibrÃ©s. 3 maps... sÃ©rieusement ?? TrÃ¨s peu d'armes et d'armures Ã  dÃ©verrouiller et qui n'ont que peu de rapport avec le fait de monter une classe en particulier. PAS DE SKINS POUR LE CHAOS ?!

Franchement il y a une trÃ¨s bonne base pour un bon jeux mais ils n'ont produit que la moitiÃ© de ce qui aurait du Ãªtre attendu. Les graphismes sont ok tier, l'ambiance rattrape le coup mais pas l'optimisation... Le PC en PLS en graphismes moyen.
Il n'y a que des promesses pour la suite (syndrÃ´me Darktide ?) et j'ai beaucoup de mal Ã  y croire.
Je n'ai pas envie d'attendre et me dire ""oui mais dans quelques mois le jeux sera complet"". Bordel ! Les fans ce sont ceux qui ont achetÃ©s Ã  la premiÃ¨re minutes ! Trahis... Comme d'hab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is What a True Experience Of a Warhammer Game! Looks Like

Chaos , Bloodshed , Victory , Everything is amazing about this game

We Have a Lot Of Warhammer Games But As You Know They Are Just Using The Warhammer Name And They Are Not Good At All

but this game delivered it all

i already seen the Roadmap and i just wish they put alot of time into this game ( More missions ,More classes , More enemy variations )

i'm Pretty Sure a Person Without Any Knowledge About Warhammer Lore Gonna Love This Game

Saber! Please Keep up the good work and Never Let the game die

And Hopefully We See a MMO Warhammer Game in Future i Always Said With a Huge Lore That The Warhammer Series Has it Can Be a Big MMO Game",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fan de l'univers depuis mon adolescence, ayant fait le premier Ã  l'Ã©poque, j'en attendais beaucoup de la suite (peut-Ãªtre trop d'ailleurs).

PremiÃ¨rement, cela fait plaisir de retrouver l'univers dans un jeu Ã  gros budget. En effet, depuis les dÃ©boires du dernier Dawn Of War, les grosses productions Ã©taient frileuses.
En revanche, il y a eu plein de jeux Ã  petits budgets ou indÃ©s qui sont des pÃ©pites.

Niveau graphisme, c'est vraiment trÃ¨s beau. Je n'ai pas grand-chose Ã  dire de plus, le visuel de l'univers n'a plus rien Ã  prouver.

CotÃ© technique, il est rÃ©ellement trÃ¨s gourmand en ressources processeur, j'ai eu du mal au dÃ©but.
i5-8600K
7900XT
16Go RAM

Avant le dernier patch, mon i5 n'en pouvait plus. J'ai quand mÃªme plus observÃ© l'efficacitÃ© du systÃ¨me de cache du jeu, bravo les devs. En effet, plus je jouais, moins j'avais de problÃ¨mes de performances. Cependant, j'ai eu de nombreux crashs Ã  un moment donnÃ© en jouant au multi.

Niveau gameplay, c'est un retour dans les annÃ©es prÃ© 2015. Cela ne conviendra pas Ã  tout le monde, mais la recette est efficace.
Il y a le mÃªme esprit que le premier, mais bien amÃ©liorÃ©. Je pense aux exÃ©cutions qui sont jouissives, l'esquive, la parade, le tir et la parade rÃ©flexe. Tout vient naturellement. L'arsenal est assez gÃ©nÃ©reux.

Niveau histoire, c'est dans la lignÃ©e du premier, Ã©pique, voire vraiment trÃ¨s Ã©pique par moments. Du bon W40K, quoi !

Niveau contenu, on reste dans les jeux modernes qui font les paris de tenir ou de faire revenir les joueurs sur un an. Donc, le contenu de base peut paraitre moyennement abondant.

Le multi je n'ai fait que la coop opÃ©rations et franchement, c'est rÃ©ellement sympa Ã  jouer.
Je pense que le jeu va me durer quelques mois, voire l'annÃ©e, vu le contenu annoncÃ©.

Pour les points faibles. Ayant jouÃ© au jeu depuis l'accÃ¨s anticipÃ©, je dirais :

- Les bugs, c'est chiant, on le rÃ©pÃ¨te : ne pas jouer Ã  la sortie.
- Un aspect rÃ©pÃ©titif dans le gameplay : si tu n'aimes pas, passe ton chemin.
- La sortie des patchs et des features de base tardive, je pense au support de l'ultra-wide.
- On en veut plus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, it's an okay game, but it's clearly selling for a higher price than it should. It's very monotonous, but it's pretty enough. If you get it at a discount, yeah, it's worth it. But for a full price - unless you're a warhammer fan... 7/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The feeling of being one of the most powerful fighting forces of the WH40K universe seems to have been intentionally removed by some highly questionable balance decisions with this most recent patch. The developers are going down the same path as another group of devs of a different high profile and popular PVE game. If you are looking for your Space Marine power fantasy fix then this would not be it in its current state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Globalement, le jeu est sympathique, surtout pour des fans de l'univers. Cependant, je peux vraiment pas le recommander, parce qu'il faut bien se rendre compte de certains points assez importants qui font que le prix n'est absolument pas lÃ©gitime :
- DÃ©jÃ , c'est un jeu couloir et pas forcÃ©ment des plus intÃ©ressants, c'est sympa mais Ã§a devient trÃ¨s trÃ¨s vite rÃ©pÃ©titif.
- Le jeu ne va rien rÃ©volutionner, faut bien le comprendre, c'est un Hack and slash classique.
- Actuellement, j'ignore si c'est uniquement mon cas mais quand mÃªme, l'optimisation en dehors du jeu, c'est Ã  dire les chargements, les tentatives de connexion, toussa, sont complÃ¨tement foireux.
- La personnalisation des personnages, sur-vendue Ã  l'origine, est vraiment pas si poussÃ©e que Ã§a, y'a assez peu d'Ã©lÃ©ments de customisation Ã  dÃ©bloquer (et ils sont assez longs Ã  dÃ©bloquer histoire de faire durer).
- Le bestiaire est assez peu fourni et, sans compter les rares boss, on se retrouve avec pas plus de 5 types d'ennemis diffÃ©rents pour les deux factions antagonistes.

Mais Ã  part Ã§a, c'est sympa et si on aime l'univers, Ã§a reste bien, le jeu est trÃ¨s beau et y'a mÃªme certaines scÃ¨nes (surtout Ã  la fin) qui sont trÃ¨s stylÃ©es (mais vraiment, faut attendre que le prix baisse).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Das Spiel ist wirklich toll und macht auch sehr viel SpaÃŸ, aber die Technischen Probleme, selbst bei Modernen PCs ist wirklich schlimm. Viele AbstÃ¼rze und VerbindungsabbrÃ¼che.

I LOVE Warhammer and the Storytelling. Little details like one tyranid spotting you and all turning their head because theyre a hivemind are amazing.

Sadly the technical side leaves the game as a ""no"".
Slow loading (even after moving it onto my SSD), start up issues, and ""losing connection"" during my single player campaign is just not a good look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the moment the gameplay loop is just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥
For melee:
- Chip damage is way to high with no tools of either preventing it, or replenishing health. (EDIT: A melee with ""fencing"" defence type has significantly reduced this problem)
- The idea of trying to keep getting armour as if it was replenishing health just isn't a sound one. The chances to replenish it are rare, but on top of that armour has such little HP and therefore what you regain is insignificant and often immediately lost.
- Parry is so odd. Not only have I found that holding the parry button delivers better results, but also a successful parry timing is done BEFORE the hit would land, unlike all other famous parry systems.
This is not an inherently bad idea, I think it's quite novel and interesting. Especially with the imagery of a parry that is prepared for being better than a parry that is ""just in time"". However this utterly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?the bed against small enemies in hordes. There is no predicting in a horde, there are attacks all the time and when you see an enemy wind up and you prepare to parry, that parry is highjacked by a random enemy that you weren't prepared for, turning your Perfect Parry into the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ parry. This leads to you getting STUNLOCKED which is a cardinal â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?sin in games like these. Absolute wank. (EDIT: This is completely removed by using a ""Fencing"" defence type weapon. Using one removes the ""just in time"" parry and makes all successful parries the same *actual* parry. Although this makes the game much much more playable and fun and removes the stunlocking, I kinda liked the preparing idea and would like to see it delegated to rare and boss heavy attacks).

Ranged:
- Guns feel like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?in terms of damage. A Rubric Marine cannot tank 20 Bolt rounds to the face unless the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is named.
- Ammo is rare as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and because of the mentioned above, is absolutely useless as you burn right through it. I only don't feel this rarity when maining a melee class for obvious reasons.

Misc:
- What the everliving â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ did they do to the Jump Pack in Operations? I don't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ if I could fall out the map, just spawn me on top of a Player or NPC if that happens. There is no good reason to have neutered it so massively.
- also why is customisation just kind of poor? I guess more will come later but just in what I'm able to change, SM1 was superior. Why can't I change lens colour or thigh armour colour? And the fact there is only Mark X â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?me off. Give me my gorgeous Mk 7 helmet and please don't make me pay Â£10 for it.
- The loading screens are abysmal and absurd. Sometimes it is faster to task manager the game out of existence than to sit through loading screens
- EDIT: the new fencing weapons feel kind of OP? I know it sounds like I'm complaining that one of my problems mentioned above is now fixed, but I can now just spam-parry my way out of minor-hordes. Not very engaging, stimulating or cognitive.

Fixes:
- Either reduce the damage Minor enemies deal in melee (one Tzeench minion should not take a whole bar off my shield), OR increase shield HP (shield HP is decent in Mini-boss events like Helbrutes so if HP is raised, so should Helbrute's damage by slightly), OR increase shield regen from specific enemy executions. Rubric marines should not give 1 shield with how much damage they deal, OR increase the health recovery after taking damage lifespan. It goes away far to fast to actually act upon.
- Have an more purposeful way to regain shield. I get nearly all of my Gun Strikes just unexpectedly, even though I'm always attempting to bash and stun enemies. Make bashing leading to a Gun Strike more consistent for minor enemies.
- You should not have to use the Prepare Parry mechanic for minor enemies. Not only does it play like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, they just aren't strong strong enough to put a Space Marine on the back foot.
- Buff the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?Jump pack in Operations. It should go as far and be active as much as the campaign or PVP. ""Oh the slam, it would be too OP"" then nerf the slam damage dibshit.

I'm going to keep playing this game every now and then in hopes that the higher class level experience is better, but it can't be a good game if I have to slog through â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for 25 hours just to get it to play nice. Also I haven't tried PVP yet but I didn't come here to do that, I came to slaughter xenos and traitors and indulge in a rare substance called fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the emperor hocam, for the emperor.

10 kÃ¼sÃ¼r sene Ã¶nce Ã§Ä±kmÄ±ÅŸ oyunu bile hala taÅŸ gibiyken bÃ¶yle bir baÅŸyapÄ±tÄ±n geliÅŸi harika oldu.

Hikayesi Ã§arpÄ±cÄ±, grafik sÄ±kÄ±ntÄ±sÄ± Ã§ekmedim ve grafikler gerÃ§ekten tatmin edici. En Ã¶nemlisi horde mekaniÄŸi ile kendinizi tank gibi hissetmeniz Ã§ok gÃ¼zel yansÄ±tÄ±lmÄ±ÅŸ. Benim iÃ§in Space Marine oyununun baÄŸlayÄ±cÄ± tek Ã¶zelliÄŸi vardÄ± o da gerÃ§ekten 3 metre boyunda bir Uzay Piyadesi gibi hissedebilmekti. BastÄ±ÄŸÄ±n adÄ±m yeri titretecek, gariban insancÄ±klar Ã¶nÃ¼nde diz Ã§Ã¶kÃ¼p sana lordum diyip imparatorun melekleri bilecekler. Ä°ÅŸte bu oyunun zevki burada Ã§Ä±kÄ±yor. Sinematik bir aksiyon ile sunumunu tamamlayan bu oyunda bize de tadÄ±nÄ± Ã§Ä±kara Ã§Ä±kara horde ayÄ±klamak kalÄ±yor. MÃ¼zikler gÃ¼zel genel olarak, zaten grotesk mÃ¼zik beÄŸeniyorsanÄ±z bu oyunun arkaplanda tÄ±ngÄ±rdattÄ±ÄŸÄ± mÃ¼zik sizi gaza getirecektir. SonuÃ§ olarak optimizasyonu ve sinematik performansÄ± gerÃ§ekten Ã§ok gÃ¼zel.

Oyunun gÃ¶ze batan en bÃ¼yÃ¼k kÃ¶tÃ¼ yanÄ± maalesef hikayesinin bitmesi ve online PvE modlarÄ±nÄ±n hikaye modundaki bÃ¶lÃ¼mlerden oluÅŸmasÄ±. Random generate PvE gÃ¶revlerde devasa bir savaÅŸÃ§Ä± olarak horde kesebilsek bu oyun bir 10 sene daha oynatÄ±r kendini.
Online kÄ±smÄ±nÄ± biraz daha renklendirirlerse ve hikayeden baÄŸÄ±msÄ±z PvE modlarÄ± gelirse bu oyun tadÄ±ndan yenmez ve yÄ±llarca daha oynatÄ±r kendini.

Ã–zetle hikaye modu iÃ§in bÃ¶brek verilir. Ama benim gibi PvP moduna Ã§ok aÅŸina olmayÄ±p aramayanlardansanÄ±z online kÄ±smÄ± ÅŸuanlÄ±k tatmin etmez. Dev ekibi 2 yÄ±llÄ±k plan aÃ§Ä±kladÄ± ve pve hakkÄ±nda planlarÄ± da var.

Karakter Customization kÄ±smÄ± Ã§ok aÅŸÄ±rÄ± ayrÄ±ntÄ±lÄ± olmasa da size sÃ¼rekli aynÄ± ÅŸeyi yapÄ±yor hissiyatÄ±nÄ± verdirmeyecek kadar tatminkar. Neden Salamanderstan bir assault yapÄ±p koluna altÄ±n sarÄ±sÄ± bant takmayayÄ±m ki?

Enis KirazoÄŸluâ€™nun Ã¶nÃ¼ne Ã§Ä±kan yeni 900 saat oynanmÄ±ÅŸ oyun olup olamayacaÄŸÄ± online modunu ne kadar geliÅŸtireceklerine baÄŸlÄ± malesef.

Tr ÅŸartlarÄ±nda must have denemez bu oyuna. Paran yoksa indirim bekle, ama Ã§ok da bekleme. Ã–nceki oyun kaÃ§ yÄ±l geÃ§miÅŸ hala 50 dolara satÄ±lÄ±yor. Ufak bir fÄ±rsat gÃ¶rÃ¼rsen yapÄ±ÅŸ. Paran var ve gerÃ§ekten hala burada yorum mu okuyorsun?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Really good sequel to an amazing game. This is one of those games that makes you feel like you're part of something way bigger than yourself. Gameplay is weighty and the guns have impact and feel great. It is a stunning game that runs really well. Excited for future updates.

That said, they really need to disclose that Epic Games Online services is required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2, Velmi oÄekÃ¡vanÃ¡ hra mnoha hrÃ¡ÄÅ¯. Tak co k tomu Å™Ã­ct. K tÃ©to hÅ™e jsem se dostal kvÅ¯li pozdnÃ­mu dodÃ¡nÃ­ Ultrawide podpory o nÄ›jakÃ½ Äas pozdÄ›ji, ale vÅ¡echen ten hype, co jsem kolem slyÅ¡el, jak je to vynikajÃ­cÃ­ a super hra, mÄ› drÅ¾el furt v nadÄ›ji, tak jsem Äekal, aÅ¾ si to budu moci poÅ™Ã¡dnÄ› vychutnat.

Je to tak vynikajÃ­cÃ­ a nejlepÅ¡Ã­ jak vÅ¡ichni Å™Ã­kajÃ­? NENÃ! Je to Å¡patnÃ¡ hra? Taky rozhodnÄ› ne. Je to dobrÃ¡ hra na jedno dohrÃ¡nÃ­, kterÃ¡ je sraÅ¾enÃ¡ Å¡patnÃ½mi gameplay rozhodnutÃ­mi vÃ½vojÃ¡Å™Å¯. KdyÅ¾ nebudeme brÃ¡t lore v potaz, ponÄ›vadÅ¾ lore 40K moc nesleduju, skonÄil jsem u Fantasy, tak i jÃ¡ jsem si vÅ¡iml pÃ¡r divnostÃ­. Ale to stranou.

ZaÄnÄ›me pozitivy: Hra vypadÃ¡ dobÅ™e, je skvÄ›le optimalizovanÃ¡, pro nÄ›kterÃ© typu ""ÄÃ­m vÄ›tÅ¡Ã­ tÃ­m lepÅ¡Ã­"" dokÃ¡Å¾e hra vyvolat wow efekt. Soundtrack, byÅ¥ nenÃ­ nejlepÅ¡Ã­, tak se zde najde pÃ¡r dobrÃ½ch skladeb, kterÃ© si chcete poslechnout nÄ›kolikrÃ¡t za veÄer, OzvuÄenÃ­ a dabing.

A co zÃ¡pory, kterÃ© podle mÄ› tu hru srÃ¡Å¾Ã­? Å patnÃ© rozhodnutÃ­ typu ""PodrÅ¾ tlaÄÃ­tko E pÅ¯l sekundy, aby sis mohl kompletnÄ› doplnit munici."" Level Design, byÅ¥ svÄ›t je pÄ›knej, tak se Äasto opakuje. DojdÄ›te na bod A, zmÃ¡ÄknÄ›te tlaÄÃ­tko, dojdÄ›te na bod B, braÅˆte bod... A to jsou asi ty jedinÃ© 2 vÄ›ci, kterÃ© v tÃ©to hÅ™e budete dÄ›lat.

DÃ¡le ovlÃ¡dÃ¡nÃ­... hru jsem hrÃ¡l na nejtÄ›Å¾Å¡Ã­ obtÃ­Å¾nost a vÄ›tÅ¡ina ÃºmrtÃ­ byla zpÅ¯sobenÃ¡ prÃ¡vÄ› proto, Å¾e Titus udÄ›lal nÄ›co, co jsem po nÄ›m nechtÄ›l. ÃštoÄÃ­te meele Ãºtokem na nepÅ™Ã¡tele? co kdyby se na to Titus vykaÅ¡lal a zaÄal ÃºtoÄit do prÃ¡zdna, kde nikdo nestojÃ­? Ve hÅ™e totiÅ¾ ovlÃ¡dÃ¡te svÃ© Ãºtoky na blÃ­zko pohybovÃ½mi klÃ¡vesami, ne tak, Å¾e ÃºtoÄÃ­te tam, kde se zrovna dÃ­vÃ¡te.

A dalÅ¡Ã­ vÄ›c. Hra nemÃ¡ moc dobÅ™e vyÅ™eÅ¡enÃ½ input. provÃ¡dÃ­te Ãºskok a hned potom chcete provÃ©st parry? Well, mÃ¡te smÅ¯lu, musÃ­te poÄkat, aÅ¾ titus dokonÄÃ­ celou animaci a aÅ¾ potom stisknout tlaÄÃ­tko, neboÅ¥ hra toto nezaregistruje. A takovÃ½ch momentÅ¯ je ve hÅ™e spousty. SkoÄÃ­te a chcete hodit granÃ¡t? zase mÃ¡te smÅ¯lu.
Hra hold neobsahuje ten ladnÃ½ combat, jak to dÄ›lÃ¡ tÅ™eba doom, kde doslova provÃ¡dÃ­te bojovÃ½ balet a vÅ¡e je v krÃ¡snÃ© harmonii.


DÃ¡le Titus, Space marine, nejlepÅ¡Ã­ z nejlepÅ¡Ã­ch. Geneticky upravenÃ½ jedinec... Tady si vÃ½vojÃ¡Å™i Å™ekli, Å¾e by nebylo Å¡patnÃ©, kdyby stÅ™elba od boku byla totÃ¡lnÄ› nepÅ™esnÃ¡ a i na 20cm tak mÅ¯Å¾e vÃ¡Å¡ nÃ¡boj minout nepÅ™Ã­tele o velikosti budovy. Ve hÅ™e si mÅ¯Å¾ete i zamÃ­Å™it, abyste mÄ›li vÄ›tÅ¡Ã­ PÅ™esnost, ale v tuto chvÃ­li jste zpomalenÃ­ a to v reÅ¾imu, kde vÃ¡s mÅ¯Å¾e nepÅ™Ã­tel bÄ›hem 1 sekundy totÃ¡lnÄ› rozsekat, opravdu nechcete. NepomÃ¡hÃ¡ ani fakt, Å¾e nepÅ™Ã¡telÃ© jsou se svou stÅ™elbou na oplÃ¡tku na 100% pÅ™esnÃ­.

BossovÃ© nejsou Å¡patnÃ­, ale u nich jsem si vÅ¡iml dalÅ¡Ã­ho problÃ©mu. Ve hÅ™e je dodge mechanika, kde kdyÅ¾ ji naÄasujete sprÃ¡vnÄ›, tak mÅ¯Å¾ete nepÅ™Ã­teli utrÅ¾it vÄ›tÅ¡Ã­ zranÄ›nÃ­, kdy mu stÅ™elÃ­te pomocÃ­ scriptu do slabÅ¡Ã­ho mÃ­sta. Toto znÃ­ dobÅ™e na papÃ­Å™e, ale v provedenÃ­ to zase nenÃ­ vyleÅ¡tÄ›nÃ½, ponÄ›vadÅ¾ pÅ™i tomto nejste na ten vÃ½stÅ™el imunnÃ­ vÅ¯Äi ostatnÃ­m jevÅ¯m, a tak vÃ¡s zase bÄ›hem zhruba 1 sekundovÃ© animace mÅ¯Å¾e nepÅ™Ã­tel seÅ™ezat.

AI nepÅ™Ã¡tel je OK, AI spoleÄnÃ­kÅ¯... snaÅ¾Ã­ se, ale nÄ›kdy dÄ›lajÃ­ divnÃ¡ rozhodnutÃ­, jako kdyÅ¾ tÅ™eba mÃ­sto toho, aby vÃ¡s zvedli, tak si vÃ¡Å¡ 3x obÄ›hnout, podÃ­vajÃ­ se na vÃ¡s, zaÄnou stÅ™Ã­let a aÅ¾ pak zaÄnou oÅ¾ivovat.

PÅ™Ã­bÄ›h tu je, ale nic z Äeho byste si sedli na zadek.

Hra jako takto je dobrÃ¡ a rozhodnÄ› jÃ­ mÅ¯Å¾u doporuÄit vÅ¡em, kteÅ™Ã­ rÃ¡di vypnou mozek a zmasakrujÃ­ si hromadu nepÅ™Ã¡tel. BohuÅ¾el tÄ›chto pÃ¡r nedokonalostÃ­ z nÃ­ nedÄ›lajÃ­ tak vynikajÃ­cÃ­ hru, jak vÅ¡ichni Å™Ã­kajÃ­. Opravit tyto nedostatky, zrychlit combat a bude to vÃ½bornÃ¡ hra.

They did it right this time. Don't expect much from the PVP, but the campaign and additional operations are 9/10. A great blend of fun and difficulty. If you like 40k, you'll like this game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 isn't just good, it is phenomenal. It is one of the best action games ever made. I cannot recommend it enough. If you missed old-school games where you just played the game, it's for you. There are no absurd skill trees, open worlds, or other BS, just pure game. I missed that.

If you don't know about Warhammer, don't worry. You don't need to know anything about it. But I would recommend watching a short recap of the first game because it's direct sequel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

El 4 de septiembre, justo antes del acceso anticipado, empecÃ© a tener miedo. El hype estaba tan por las nubes que temÃ­a que al momento de empezar a jugar, me supiera a poco. Y entonces llegÃ³ el dÃ­a y pasÃ³ uno de esos momentos extra satisfactorios que pasan una vez cada 50 o 100 juegos. Cada minuto de hype, de machacar el botÃ³n de replay de los trailers en YouTube, se vio ampliamente satisfecho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Estamos ante un shooter con cÃ¡mara al hombro total y absolutamente tradicional. Algo criticado por algunos, pero que sin duda, somos mayorÃ­a quienes echÃ¡bamos de menos Ã©ste tipo de juego. Sin complicaciones, sin medias tintas, directo a la acciÃ³n pura y cruda, los primeros Wolfenstein o el mÃ­tico Quake. PodrÃ­amos decir que Ã©ste juego hace exactamente lo mismo pero con los Gears of War-like de sexta generaciÃ³n, aquellos maravillosos dÃ­as de Xbox 360 y Playstation 3. Y tal como pasa con los Boomer-Shooter, lo hace trayendo lo mejor de aquellos tiempos fusionado con lo mejor del videojuego contemporÃ¡neo, siendo esto controles mÃ¡s pulidos y satisfactorios, apartado grÃ¡fico moderno (de infarto me atreverÃ­a a decir en Ã©ste caso), y explotando la tecnologÃ­a moderna para entregar un apartado artÃ­stico digno de revisiÃ³n.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Y es que en Ã©ste Space Marine 2, las carencias de un lado balancean con las virtudes del otro. A priori el gameplay puede antojarse soso y anticuado, pero te olvidas al momento cuando Ã©ste se desarolla con un control fluido y 100% accesible, y una ambientaciÃ³n que ya quisieran muchos juegos de licencia. Y es que Ã©ste es quizÃ¡s su punto mÃ¡s fuerte, Ã©ste juego es sobre y ante todo, aÃºn con las limitaciones tÃ©cnicas de la Ã©poca, conseguÃ­a entregarnos escenarios y situaciones dignas de Ã©ste universo Grim Dark," en Space Marine 2 Ã©ste aspecto se ve vitaminado y anabolizado a niveles de locura. Recorrer y luchar en las calles de ciudades colmena que hasta ahora solo habÃ­an sido representadas en artworks de Games Workshop o en escenografÃ­as para el juego de mesa de torneos tipo """"Apocalypse""""", las llamadas escenografÃ­as de en sueÃ±o," que requieren de varias mesas y aÃ±os de trabajo. O el las junglas que de un modo u otro de susurran al oÃ­do """"Katachan"""". Si eres nuevo en el universo de Warhammer 40k", muy probablemente te despierte un genuino interÃ©s en saber mÃ¡s, pero si venÃ­as con cierto grado de conocimiento, o incluso fanatismo como es mi caso, vas a desear que el juego no termine nunca.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Y Ã©sto se traduce en las propias mecÃ¡nicas tambiÃ©n. El ver una horda hormagauta que se extiende hasta el horizonte, pudiendo disparar y ver como hasta los individuos mÃ¡s lejanos caen ante el fuego de tus armas, y en cuestiÃ³n de minutos verte rodeado por docenas, incluso cientos de tirÃ¡nidos atacando al unÃ­sono, llegando," realmente te lleva sentir genuinamente aquello de """"Ellos serÃ¡n mi bastiÃ³n contra el terror"," los defensores de la humanidad."""" No han sido pocas las veces", siendo yo alguien que evita las osbrereacciones frente a la pantalla," que me he visto al borde de gritar """"Muere escoria"," por el emperador"""". O inclusive salir airoso de una situaciÃ³n peliaguda y recitar de forma totalmente orgÃ¡nica y sin forzar un """"el emperador protege"""".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Todas las armas son satisfactorias de usar, desde las tipo bÃ³lter, ya sean pistolas, rifles o ametralladoras pesadas, cada una en su estilo, pero nos traen a cambio la espada de energÃ­a, la cual consigue ser mejor punto medio entre la espada sierra y el martillo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Si hay algo que echarÃ­a en falta, y es algo que ya me pasaba en el primero, y sin embargo en Ã©ste aspecto, Space Marine de 2011 llegaba a hacerlo mejor, es algo mÃ¡s de personalizaciÃ³n para los modos cooperativo y multijugador online. En el caso de los Marines leales, sigue estando muy centrado en el capÃ­tulo de los Ultramarines, cuando se trata de capÃ­tulos con una estÃ©tica propia y distinguible, a lo sumo podremos arroparnos a un Ãngel Oscuro o un Templario Negro, pero ya serÃ¡ mÃ¡s difÃ­cil conseguirlo con otros como serÃ­an la Guardia del Cuervo, los Lobos Espaciales o inclusive un capÃ­tulo tan querido como los Ãngeles Sangrientos. En el caso de los Marines traidores, Ã©sta es ya casi nula, limitÃ¡ndose a cambiar el color y la herÃ¡ldica del armadura, teniendo cada clase una legiÃ³n asignada. Si quieres un Marine de Asalto de los Devoradores de Mundos, tendrÃ¡s que hacer de tripas corazÃ³n y hacerlo llevando las piezas de armadura de los Amos de la Noche, por poner un ejemplo.

So far i am enjoying the game, a friend gifted me more than enough to get the gold edition. The first day was before the patch note a day ago, my cpu was cooking at 90c+ but now it is hovering between 65-75c max.

Honestly got no idea about the space marine story or lore, but i did play some warhammer games such as vermintide 1, and 2, darktide, and this one currently.

Graphics wise the game looks great, some details are more focused on than others, but it is really nice looking.
Not sure why they went with 3 players co-op and not the usual 4 player majority of people got used to, but maybe they have their reasons.

Game running buttery smooth, 4k max settings, native resolution, no upscaling, 65+ fps all the time. PC specs 14900k, 4090, 64gb ram.

one thing they may need to improve on, but this might be due to my region, is that i dont have any nearby servers to join to, and this affects people like me in Middle East, as the least ping we saw was 87 or 94 ping, never lower.



i recommend buying the base for now and upgrade later if you feel like it. 8/10.

*to avoid confusion for the received product for free in my first review, a friend of mine gifted me $ to buy the game. and didn't get a key or such from developers..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For all the improvements made to the core gameplay loop, a glaring issue can be found in the half-arsed implementation of the Operations mode. Unlike it was claimed by the devs, it does not have a solo play mode. It also doesn't have a proper way to ensure we are the hosts, forcing us to matchmake into an unstable pool of players with extremely long load times (we cannot kick them while they are loading), players who are either AFK or are playing dress up, or simply hanging lobbies that don't even load at all. This lack of control has, personally, forced me to leave several lobbies nearly every time I want to play a mission.

I cannot recommend the game while one of the features that offers it replayability is held back by such a poorly thought out matchmaking system. Allow for private lobbies and give us a server list, this has been solved for decades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Super jeux, je le recommande. Tout fan de warhammer 40000 sera comblÃ©, bon exceptÃ© son prix qui est pas trop donnÃ©... Mais bon, super jeux tactique, bourrin, ce qui change d'autres jeux mdr (que je nommerai pas) et en prime, chaque joueur peut vraiment avoir sa propre personnalitÃ© dans le perso qu'il joue c'est ouf xD. Je remercie Focus Interactive et Saber pour ce jeu, c'est vraiment une pÃ©pite. Encore une fois, le seul petit defaut qui picote c'est son prix et le fait qu'il faut un pc de ouf pour le faire tourner (ma config Ã  7 ans, mais j'ai changÃ© certains composants et je le fait tournÃ© Ã  peine en low et partout," du coup c'est un peu moche mais si vous avez une formule 1 vous en prendrez plein les mirettes).""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Um dos melhores jogos que joguei ultimamente, sem wokismo, sem relacionamentos amorosos, apenas muito sangue, muito gore, muito odio, muito fascismo, muita xenofobia e mais outras coisas boas, e esse jogo me abriu os olhos pra comecar a entender a lore do warhammer 40k q eh bem interessante...infelizmente eu sei que nao eh todo mundo q vai gostar desse jogo pq precisa de testo alta pra conseguir aprecia-lo da maneira correta

8/10 - so gostaria que tivesse mais tipos de inimigos, talvez mais faccao (mas eu sei que nao faria sentido mais faccao nessa historia)

I've finished the campaign and have a few more hours. I have some additional points I want to add while still maintaining my original points. I have friends to play with but a lot of the time I only have so much time or I just want to play alone. Steam having this in the single player category with the tag and, the promises of the devs to be able to progress solo caught my attention. Especially with this having a huge emphasis on co-op, that got me incredibly interested. That's the kind of basis I'd like to start with. Obviously these are just my points and opinions.

It's an odd choice when most pc players (I think) will be on Steam based on the community consensus of Epic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, as I'm sure is defined somewhere in the fine print like usual. This is plainly unacceptable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-Progression is tied to online services. I don't believe this applies to the campaign, I repeat this doesn't affect the campaign but, you won't be leveling up your classes while offline. I've seen a lot of people try to say based off of that, that this isn't a Live Service game. You will be wasting your time, you will not be progressing if you don't play online. Online services are a core part of this game. I absolutely hate Live Service games bc, one bad decision from the devs could potentially destroy the game and it's future. Helldivers 2 is a good example of being the biggest, best and fan favorite game of the year quickly turning into a very unenjoyable one. This Live Service model needs to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-Playing solo is not possible while maintaining your online status in the Operations Gamemode. You're forced into a server, and to play with others. The devs stated it would be possible to play alone and make progress but, to my knowledge it isn't possible at this time. So if you're short on time, like to play casually, or just want to play alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-You cannot customize your Space Marine in the campaign or use classes. There are pre-applied skins that you can use with Titus in the campaign but to my knowledge the only skin I've seen, comes with the ultimate edition. Nor can you use classes in the campaign. The campaign will most likely be a sort of intro into the game and it's mechanics for most players and will be untouched after completion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, nor their abilities. I liked tactical and sniper but I cannot stand the equipment that you are limited to with some of the other classes. I didn't watch this game like a hawk as some did but, when I first picked it up, I didn't think the classes would be so neutered in what weapons they're able to equip. Especially after finishing the campaign, I felt extremely limited in my options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-The performance in my experience isn't terrible but it's extremely inconsistent. My GPU and CPU will jumping all over the place. My FPS never got over 60-65 no matter what settings I tried. I have an good pc and even then, I don't like running my system too hard. I couldn't find a nice middle ground between performance and visuals. Definitely going to need some smoothing out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, I found that hitting parry to the blue prompts, or dodging the red ones, half the time didn't register. There's always the possibility of human error here but it seems I am not the only one experiencing this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#NAME?, there's only one other than the base edition that I even consider. If you'd like to get the season pass as well as some of the skins, I would recommend the Gold Edition but, the Ultimate Edition (UE) is plainly disappointing. Especially since the skins are not universal. Ex. Titus's skin from the UE can't be used in Operations or PvP. The only class-based skin you get is, I believe, that can't be used in the campaign. You get three other skins I think for certain weapons but again, they're not universal so I can't exactly say it's worth it. Just do not buy the UE. It simply isn't worth it. I bought the Ultimate Edition for a hefty discount from another store. I'd advise looking into that if you still want the UE but $100, heck even the $90 Gold edition just to play the game early, get the season pass and, a few skins is not enough to justify that price tag. Absolutely outrageous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Good Points are:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-The game's performance isn't great but I didn't experience crashes like a lot of others did. I have crashed maybe once. There were times when I thought a bunch of stuttering would lead to more crashes but they didn't. I'm reading that some people can't get past the first cut scene...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-The Campaign's story although very short, is great. I am not very fluent in Warhammer lore so I can't say how it is lore wise but, I was happy with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have much more criticisms of this game than I have praise but, this review will turn to positive when the devs smooth out the performance, rebalancing the classes is a must IMO as some are quite bad. then to deliver on promises of playing solo for us solo players and the casuals. This is a typical game where the devs say it'll have features and, performance etc. just not at launch... give us a few weeks and then it'll be the game you were promised. Ultimately," it's up to you to decide but I would wait a few weeks... even months then check back in.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it doesn't run as well on my 4070ti as I'd like, this game kicks utter ass. It feels, genuinely, like a game from 2010. Both in good and bad. A singleplayer/co-op campaign, a PvE operation mode that has its own separate progression from it but ties into it narratively, and a pretty solid, no-frills-all-skill PvP classic arena-esque modes. A full package.

I almost forgot what it felt like to have a game release as a full package. Nowadays most games release with either the solo experience, completely a PvE coop one, or are PvP only. Most in the former camp have, at best, a small DLC of a mission or two to look forward to, and the latter is a microtransaction hellscape of every-other-month season passes. But here comes Space Marine 2, of a franchise I dismissed until recently, to give me it all. Visceral PvE combat against swarms of Tyranids both in campaign and the PvE operation mode (for a Halo nerd, seemingly very akin to Spartan Ops from 4) and the ability to shoot people's virtual, heretical avatars. And yet they promise more content to come, with a grand amount of customization to make your own little Imperium soldier spaceman.

I'm not going to say it's perfect. There's 6 PvE missions and as many, if not less, PvP maps and modes. But given the success so far and how good the final product is regardless, I'm going to put my faith we'll see that extra content. The season pass isn't a 10$ gate to a cosmetic progression system like everything else post-Overwatch, but rather the early 2010s version of a Season Pass. Which is to say, ""Give us 40 bucks and we'll give you the rest of our content later. Nebulous content we can't exactly assure you the quality of, but hey, it's coming regardless"". 10 years ago that version of a Season Pass was scummy, but maybe my will is eroded. I prefer that infinitely to 10 bucks for battle royale skins every 3 months. Like I said, it's a game that feels directly lifted from the early 2010's, and balance, especially in PvP, can feel a iffy (why can Bulwarks block my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?Bolt Sniper).

It makes up for it way more in what it offers though, and promises more to come in Marine Chapters and PvE/PvP content, a horde mode, et cetera. Easily a GOTY 2024 contender, and that's not just because it's been a light year. You'll swap from playing Gears of War third person shooting to Arkham countering and melee bashing on a dime, and cover yourself in excess gore as you do it. Easily recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Updating my review as promised. This game is an easy 10/10 for anyone who likes a healthy challenge, unique but fair (and rewarding) combat, and a fun class/perk system. Easy to spend hours on, especially when playing with friends. Such a well rounded game.

Devs addressed my review and the gripes most players had with the previous patch and made sincere improvements to game play with the latest patch which is more than I can say for the majority of newer games. Super happy to add this game back to my rotation. I know I will be playing this game for a long, long time to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great game so far, no issues as of yet. Highly recommend if you are thinking of buying, brutal combat amazing scenes to behold. The swarms are incredible to witness.

Epic games stuff doesnt phase me

Ultrawide support will come in time so not a problem.

All these unwarranted negative reviews for a 'game' that they havent played yet due to being snowflakes under some EULA waiving your rights to what exactly, nothing thats gonna stop you enjoying the game. Just relax and enjoy the carnage.

The other half of people crashing/freezing I'm sure they'll patch these issues whatever they may be. Or is this your first time playing a game on launch?

All just my opinion so take it with a pinch of salt, but I hope you enjoy the game as much as I have so far if you plan to buy it!

Overpriced console game.

Combat is very cinematic and looks good, but gameplay is actually rather clunky and below average in quality (badly designed and implemented arkham knight mechanics).

Difficulties for the campaign are done the worse way possible : weaken the player character and increase enemy dmg an hp while keeping encounters exactly the same aside from that. This completely ruins the flow, which is already not too great to begin with. Players should always select normal difficulty if solo, especially since AI is an insult to intelligence and increase the frustration of the bad flow even further. Higher difficulties might be fun with a group of competent players (may be).

Campaign is 6-8h long, same for PVE...won't even mention PVP which has clearly been added to the game for reddit whiners who can't handle not having PVP in an RPG (play one game to see how hilariously bad it is though). So you get what...15-20h tops out of the game tops (unless you want to farm the same 6 PVE missions over and over again for skins...but why do that anyways?). For a base price of 60 bucks + 40 bucks season pass that you won't even want to farm, this is the definition of a VERY BAD investment. Check Steam store to see what you can get for a 100 bucks and cry.

Story is cool and fits well in the current 40k storyline developments though.

Money for the emperor !

Update : even though it lacks content, PVE missions (AKA Operations) are quite tasty. The different classes, with their respective gameplays and the progression systems are nice. There have been a bunch of gameplay balancing passes that have been done since release, some are good, some are bad. They address issues that are inherent to the core gameplay, and require a lot of work for the team, I hope they will eventually bring the game to an even better place, and that they will release a lot more content, because it has the potential to be really great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 isn't interested in those futile Guardsmen digging their trenches, it's not interested in showing you the horrors of war (although, come to think of it, Conscript with Kriegsmen would go hard). Neither is Saber Interactiveâ€™s sequel interested in giving you a look at the grand scale of humanity's vast empire 38,000 years from now. This is a power fantasy through and through, so don your power armour, pick up your Thunder Hammer, and purge this world of xenos filth!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until they fix some major issues I'm done with this game. I'm convinced the game is single handedly being held up by the fact that it's a 40k game alone. If it were any other franchise it would have tanked day one. The game was already in a state that desperately needed changes and buffs, but instead they just nerfed the players to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The coherency feature is just godawful and makes absolutely no sense in this game. Your forced to either stay with your ranged team mates on melee classes, or stay with your melee team mates on ranged classes. Forget about splitting up to more efficiently complete objectives or to flank enemies. Most classes have perk options that are obsolete and never worth taking. The game was advertised as a hack and slash type horde game, but the game punishes you for using a hack and slash style. The enemies are all reactive to you, so any time you start swinging your melee weapon or shooting, they are interrupting you with attacks, which you then need to dodge or parry, and while you're being swarmed in melee, there are 10 ranged gaunts and 5 majoris with devourers peppering down your armour, which you won't get back if you aren't within 5 feet from one of your team mates now, and then every 100 meters you travel you have to deal with an extremis encounter of some sort on top of all of that. The whole game is like a souls game fight, except with additional enemies. You make one mistake, you're downed. I thought this was Space Marines, not Space Guardsmen. Only 17% of the player base has actually completed an operations mission on ruthless, but somehow the devs think the game was ""too easy""? Be wary of all the positive reviews that don't actually go into any detail about gameplay. Most of them are just fan boys who were going to give this game a positive review regardless just because it's a 40k game with decent graphics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Was going to see what they do with this first season patch to make a review and the review is a NO....
Saber is going the same way as Helldivers 2 NERFING instead of buffing useless weak weapons IN PVE!!!
Exactly the same stupid mentality as Arrowhead... your not going to feel like a space marine in this game your going to feel like Imperial Guard instead this was a PATHETIC patch and now we all see what Saber really wants to do like Arrowhead ""OuR ViSiOn"" hurrr duurrr good luck when your game dies idiots....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The design and epic is absolutely amazing. But from a technical standpoint, it's very clunky and stiff, it feels like the game was made 15 years ago

- Uncomfortable controls
- Weird parry system
- Just annoying ranged enemies
- Changing the difficulty level only alters enemy HP and damage output
- When choosing equipment/classes, it feels like you're heavily restricted

""They shall be my finest warriors, these men who give of themselves to me. Like clay I shall mould them, and in the furnace of war forge them. They will be of iron will and steely muscle. In great armour shall I clad them and with the mightiest guns will they be armed. They will be untouched by plague or disease, no sickness will blight them. They will have tactics, strategies and machines so that no foe can best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines and they shall know no fear.""

T L D R - Learn to dodge and parry to make combat make sense, there is not enough content to justify the price, and it's a cool glimpse into the 40k universe through the personalities of the characters. Also, the operations mode is fun and replayable, but the weapon progression system sucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was refreshing but ironic to find authentic characters in peak fiction. The campaign story is just a glimpse into the grim dark of 40k, but more about the universe is revealed through the personalities of the fear incarnate warriors known as Space Marines and the machine cultists who assist them. Even though the story is short, through their dialogue and interactions you learn why the characters are motivated to continue existing in one of the bleakest, most depraved, and nightmarish universes ever conceived. No matter how bad things get, uh, finds a way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Operations mode multiplayer missions are fun, but the progression system is bad because by the time you start unlocking the higher weapons, you will be bored out of your gourd from doing the same mission(s) 40,000 times. You just unlock things far too long after your desire to grind expires for how repetetive the gameplay loop is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is way too little content in the launch week to justify the price of the game. I guess inflation does not only affect packages of bacon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tutorial is fun, but it did not adequately teach my inner ape how to use the dodge and parry mechanics. Once I learned how to frequently use dodge and parry to counterattack and stagger, the combat became more interesting and my survivability went up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P.S. Why TF is the shield not attached to his arm? There are so many skull symbols," you could throw a dart at a Space Marine and it would hit 3 skulls while flying through the air.

After working on Linux since launch, the latest patch has made online play impossible. They have since changed Linux to unsupported and have emailed people that the game will not be supported. Other people have received emails that it's an issue being worked on.

The devs themselves have said full steamdeck (linux support) is coming by end of year on their website.

Most people have probably exceeded the 2 hour playtime as this point, so no refunds and no official statements of any kind.

All in all I can't recommend it currently.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will leave up the original but they have fixed it in their latest patch. They do not mention that you have to add launch command SteamDeck=1 %command% or it wont work.

Right click on the game in Steam -> Properties -> General -> Launch Options.

The game itself is definitely a labor of love, it shows that a lot of attentions went into the details. I think for a lot of WH40K fans this was exactly the game they were waiting for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As it stands now I can't recommend this game at this point. I paid for the gold version, so I'm 90 bucks deep into this game. I paid a premium for it.

On the technical side of things I don't have much to say. I've got a beast of a PC and it ran well. Never had a hickup. I did have many bugs however where my camera would bug out during a finisher or be thrown across the map while doing a finisher.

I had high hopes for this, being a massive 40K fan. Especially since I would get to play a Space Marine. Or so I thought. More on that later.

Campaign:
It is alright. Not much to say on it. It is so short it is barely worth mentioning. The story is cool, I think. You get to see a couple of different factions and a pretty big ending. The power scaling in the campaign makes you feel like a space marine. Barely.

I doubt that anyone who isn't into 40k would get as much as I did out of the campaign given teh lack of ""Oh I know that!"" moments which was around 40% of the fun. Can't fault them for the accuracy, it feels pretty authentic.

Haven't played it and I suspect that not many will.

Here is where the issues lie. Given that the campaign is over if you blink too fast you'll find yourself either playing operations or PVP. With these operations you have 6 missions. Bland, uninspired. Any misconception of you playing a space marine will vanish at this point. Basic ennemies (Minoris ennemies) will delete your health faster than a guardsman falling during a Krieg assault. You feel about as durable as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient. You deal about as much damage as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient too. Oh and don't worry, you can increase your damage output from 1 to 1.2 if you reach level 25. So you can look forward to upgrading your damage to that of an overzealous toddler if you can manage to stick it out for that long.

Weapon variety is non-existent. You get maybe 4 weapons per class? A bit more if you play the tactical. Forget about playing any kind of melee class as well. You'll find yourself stunlocked. Yes, stun locked... in a horde shooter and slasher game. You missed that weird parry window? Well too bad you're dead now. Good you had that expensive Space Marine armor on right? Otherwise, you'd be dea-... oh right. Oh and don't forget that for many classes you don't even get a rifle or a melee weapon.

Sadly you are very sloooow in this game. Attacks take a financial quarter to complete only to provide diminishing returns. You have all the bad aspects of being heavily armored while not being tanky at all. Usually, games will make you slow and heavy in order to being able to take a lot of damage, and quick and nimble but able to take less damage. Not in this game. You'll take massive amounts of damage from a small critter of which there are around 30 around you at any given time aaaand be slow and deal no damage. Remember from the lore when they said ""Nothing that big should be that fast""? Yeah, must have been something the devs missed or something.

I feel like I do have to talk about this... I've seen a lot of ""skill issue"" comments brought to people who don't like the clunky combat and broken parry system. I have finished all from software games with the exception of sekiro and elden ring. So the choice is all follows: Either Space Marine 2 is harder than Bloodborne, Darksouls 1 to 3 and demon souls, or there might be something wrong with the gameplay.

I'd say buy this when it is on sale or maybe just buy another game. I hear good things about Black Myth Wukong. Strangely enough in Darktide you feel more powerful than in this game. Despite playing a prisoner under the orders of an inquisitor and not a superhuman angel of death.

This game had all my bias stacked in its favor, yet I still canâ€™t recommend it. I played it for 20 hours, thinking that at some point the fun must start. Around any corner now. But it never came. I never felt like a space marine. And if I could refund it I would. But Iâ€™ve been punished for being optimistic. If you buy this game, expect nothing and then maybe it will surprise you by mistake.

I may revisit it if the devs rework many of the systems but we all know that it isn't going to happen;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40.000: Space Marine II, is truly a masterpiece action game for this year. Masculinity, gore, action, and combat are the best.

Das Table-Top von Warhammer ist teuer und so ist auch dieses Spiel (auch wenn 60â‚?im Vgl. zu heutigen Vollpreistiteln wieder total im Rahmen liegt). Es ist somit ein Spiel, was viel Liebe zum Detail zur Vorlage zeigt. Leider sind dadurch die AnsprÃ¼che an Komponenten anspruchsvoll und es kann vor allem am Anfang zu viel Rumprobieren fÃ¼hren, um die richtigen Einstellungen zu haben.
Die Kampagne ist schÃ¶n knackig, hat wunderschÃ¶n designte Level und den ein oder anderen epischen Bosskampf. Wenn man diese dann durch hat, kann man in den sogenannten Missionen nochmal die Geschehnisse aus der Sicht seines eigenen modifizierbaren Space Marin erleben.
Wer dann noch immer nicht genug hat, kann sich auch noch in einen Multiplayer stÃ¼rzen, in welchem sich Astartes und HÃ¤retiker die KÃ¶pfe einschlagen.

Am Ende bleibt nur noch zu sagen: ""FÃœR DEN IMPERATOR!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The wait was worth it so far, one of the best games of the year

Runs perfectly on high settings for me, buttery smooth 99% of the time, campaign is excellent so far and the combat feels great, graphically a very impressive game, co-op works great but there are some server issues at the moment which was to be expected for Day 1 I guess.

If you like Warhammer 40k, or co-op horde shooters in general, its a must buy for me, and that's without having even touched the PvE Operations or the PvP modes yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm very conflicted about this game. I will continue to play and might change to a positive. But right now these are my thoughts. I have played through the single player on veteran. (which is basically hard difficulty).

Hopefully this helps people if they are struggling to enjoy the game. I know I was in the very first hours. Even now I cannot recommend at the current price even if I am enjoying it more.

In short, Space Marine 2 is effectively Darksiders crossed with Doom: Eternal, without the parts that made either of those games good.

The combat is... not particularly fun? It's very difficult to figure out how the game actually wants you to play it.

For example...

You will take damage. I think this is intended, but initally feels at odds with the fact you are a hulking tank of a space marine. That's werid, but okay I just don't understand the game perhaps.

Anyway, you can't avoid taking damage, so in order to not die, you have to perform executions/context specific moves to get back armour (which is basically health). This is very much like doom eternal where you get enemies into a stun like state and do an execution to get back ammo/health (even has the same flashing red thing around enemies)

But the problem, this play style is full of inconsistency. In Doom Eternal you can attack enemies while reliably know you can get ammo/health/whatever. In Space Marine 2, this is not possible. The gun shot thing might happen or it might not. Parries sometimes work, and feel like sometimes they don't. It can be hard to tell when an enemy will go into an execution state while you are attacking it and so predicting when you are about to get the next armour boon is hard.

This makes a lot of the combat is more random and about chance than anything, and the game is about managing your health in this regard.

So you think, okay, maybe I'm doing it wrong. I'll sit back and used ranged weapons instead of melee.

No.

Guns are piss weak.

As far as I can tell, they are designed to close the distance with enemies and open them up for melee. Some special/heavy weapon are designed to shred mobs, but even then some of those enemies can block all ranged damage lol.

Okay, I'll go back to closing the distance with guns, using melee combos and parrys to get armour and fight through the enemies that way. Maybe I'm just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at parrying?

Nah, because some of the early level design has ranged enemies that you can't get to... Those ranged sniper enemies can take upwards of 100 bullets to kill with some weapons. That is almost all of your ammo for one enemy?! How the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ does this game want you to play? I still have no idea after 9 hours.

Enemies also need to be taken out in order because other wise you will get utterly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Once you know this the game is exponentially more enjoyable. But when you don't...

For instance, the ranged dudes, you might think its fine to just keep dodging and killing the little mobs first. No, no, no. If you don't go for the ranged dudes with an almost suicidal vigor you will be absolutely creamed.

You will be dodging. A lot. Pretty much spamming the space bar.

Which brings me onto the controls for PC. They are utterly utterly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™? Change these as fast as you can.

I recommend making right click aim (you know like in every game known to man) instead of right click being melee.

Then make middle mouse button parry instead of C. C being parry is utterly deranged.

Then make F melee. Trust me, again, this makes the game exponentially better.

Anyway, it' s very weird game that I am forcing myself to try and like. I do not understand the reviews that say the combat is brilliant. I feel like I'm playing a different game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bon, faisons simple : Le jeu vous a tapÃ© dans l'oeil parce que vous Ãªtes fan de w40k ? Si vous connaissez l'univers que vous comprenez le lore et que vous avez le vocabulaire qui va avec alors bienvenu dans la barge de bataille. Il est temps pour vous de prendre les armes au cotÃ©s de vos frÃ¨res.

Par contre, Si vous pipez rien a w40k que vous savez pas reconnaitre un bolter d'un fusil laser dÃ©solÃ© l'ami mais passe ton chemin. Le jeu est lÃ  pour plaire aux fans. Aucune explication n'est donnÃ©. Exemple si vous ne savez pas par avance qu'il faut tuer les porteurs synaptique pour tuer une horde de tyranide vous Ãªtes dÃ©jÃ  perdu. Donc vraiment ce jeu est fait pour ceux et celles qui aiment l'univers et sont fan w40k. Si vous Ãªtes casu... Vous pouvez l'apprÃ©cier mais vous ne comprendrez pas.

Sur le reste et bien pour ma part sur ma 3070 aucun bug mis Ã  part 1 crash une seule et unique fois face Ã  trop d'adversaire. Sinon vraiment le jeu est nickel aucun soucis technique beaucoup de contenu. Le fait de devoir faire la campagne pour unlock les missions coop multi est pas plus mal. Ca nous donne vraiment l'impression que les missions coops en parallÃ¨le nous raccroche Ã  l'histoire. Par contre bon dieu que c'est difficile ! En normal le jeu commence dÃ©jÃ  Ã  vous punir sÃ©vÃ¨rement lorsque vous ratez un contre alors dans les modes de difficultÃ© plus dur ca doit Ãªtre un vÃ©ritable dÃ©fi. En tout 6 missions coop, 6h de campagne je dirais ( + si on souhaite augmenter la difficultÃ© ), Beaucoup beaucoup d'arme et de classe Ã  monter en coop/multi pvp, et bien entendu beaucoup de custom pour ravir tout bon space marine. Je n'ai pas encore test le pvp mais s'il est digne du 1 aucun doute que ce sera vraiment incroyable.

TrÃ¨s heureux pour ma part de revenir chez les blood raven une nouvelle fois pour exterminer des xenos.
Par contre IMPORTANT :
Le jeu a besoin d'un ssd pour fonctionner sinon vous pouvez rester comme un idiot sur les chargements pendant trÃ©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©s longtemps. Le jeu fonctionne trÃ¨s bien sur des config en dessous de la norme ( la preuve mon processeur a 8ans ) par contre vÃ©rifier de le mettre sur un ssd si vous voulez pouvoir lancer le jeu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope nicht fÃ¼r 60â‚?
das game fÃ¤ngt das Warhammer feeling richtig gut ein und sieht in der UE5 unglaublich gut aus.
aber es schwÃ¤chelt an vielen stellen.

Der Content der fÃ¼r 60â‚?geboten wird ist einfach viel zu wenig. die Kampagne ist nach gut 15 stunden auf normal durch.
Die KI Kollegen sind dumm wie Brot und wenns drauf ankommt bleibt alles am spieler hÃ¤ngen.
Dazu kommt noch das sich nach Zwischensequenzen meine AusrÃ¼stung wie von geisterhand Ã¤ndert. Man findet in der Mission eine Plasmapistole und ein Energieschwert, cutscene, plÃ¶tzlich hat man wieder einen Bolter und Kettenschwert..... was soll das?
die Spezial Operationen die man im MP spielen kann, belaufen sich genau auf 6 stÃ¼ck. das ist einfach zu wenig.
Aus mir nicht ersichtlichen grÃ¼nden kann man eine Operation nicht starten wenn zweimal dieselbe klasse vorhanden ist.
Manche klassen sind mMn aktuell unspielbar wegen diverser design mÃ¤ngel. Der ZerstÃ¶rer zum beispiel kann in der schweren haltung weder kontern noch ausweichen. auch fehlen mir Warhammer key features. Warum kann man keine Tarantula BoltergeschÃ¼tz als airdrop rufen bei verteitigungen oder minen legen? es gibt auch keine Terminatoren RÃ¼stungen, und die dazu passende bewaffnung ala Sturmkanone oder Cyclon-Raketenwerfer. auch is das allgemeine Waffenarsenal recht dÃ¼nn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct upgrade over the first game in every way.

A dream come true! Hyped for future content and hoping for the Chaos Space Marine Survival / Defence game mode

Edit:
Just finished the campaign in co-op and oh boy is it a ride. I really missed linear shooters and this has scratched the itch. We did encounter a few minor visual bugs but nothing game breaking. The pacing is great and the cinematics give you the urge to give your life for the Emperor.

Easily one of the greatest games I've ever played, but I might be biased :')

Please note that if you expect a long replayability and game content, you'll be disappointed. It doesn't offer much in terms of content and I believe the live service trend of the modern gaming scene is disgusting, but I have my hopes up for the future co-op content!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIe Story macht spaÃŸ, ist interessant und hat viele Epische Momente die einfach Bock machen.
Koop Missionen 7.5/10
An sich sind die Missionen gelungen und schÃ¶n gestaltet, aber dennoch sind zum Release 6 Missionen doch sehr mau und werden schnell Langweilig, dafÃ¼r kann die hÃ¶here Schwierigkeit und das zusammenspiel mit Freunden dies gut entgegenwirken.

Okay the game is fun to play and I love it. HOWEVER

UPDATE:
The CPU temp problems have been fixed finally and I don't have to worry about it overheating on me.

This game is my first ever Warhammer game apart from the actual board game itself and I've got to say. I absolutely love everything about it. Just killing so many creatures at the same time with a whole sword and stuff feels extremely satisfying and the gore makes it 100x better too.

The story itself is pretty short but the missions are quite long so you've got around over 8 hours of gameplay with the campaign alone.

The side operations are really fun to do as well as they are linear to the story line of the game.

Aside all that. 9/10 fantastic game, definitely recommend",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patch 3.0 broke the game on windows and linux. I can't connect to the game servers and constantly get an AVF error. Whatever changes made in 3.0 has basically made this game a complete waste of money. I liked the game. Sucks that I can't play it so I'll be returning the game as the developers have zero incentive to fix the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game has so many massive issues that it's infuriating. The gameplay is good, when you can actually get to it. The problem is that it's constantly dropping players from servers or just keeping them in a pseudo-excluded state where you can't matchmake. I've been stuck in perpetual, non-resolving loading screens at least a dozen times; and the only way to get out of those screens is to alt+esc and end the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall: 8/10 (Only played the main story until now, will add more later)

Well, pre-ordered this game as fast as possible since I saw the gameplay... it was like love at first sight, never played read anything about the universe of Warhammer 40K and I knew this was the entry point for it, didn't disappoint at all.

Positives:

-Main story is very good, for a person that didn't played the first game I get to knew Titus and understand what he did back there and that it is still haunting him.
-I didn't knew the universe of warhammer 40k but got a pretty good taste of it because of this game and I want to know MORE!
-Character development, even tho the campaign is short the characters have a good development (will not talk about it because of spoiler), specially the other 2 brothers that fight along side you.
-You can play co-op in the main story and the other mode which is super interesting, you can play your story with your brother and enjoy the masterpiece that it is.
-The Swarm technique is insane, seeing all the hundreds of monsters around and around the map without taking a huge toll in your pc performance its incredible, it feels marvelous fighting hordes of horrendous heretics without burning your pc!
-SO MUCH TESTOSTERONE ! FOR THE EMPEROR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Negatives:

-Bots-AI they get stuck sometimes
-Some visual bugs in pieces of the armor while watching a semi-cutscene, kind of distracts you
-Super short main story, around 8/9 hours which is a bummer since it was going pretty well.
-Can't customize anything in the campaign basically, it is poor the characterization of Titus and his brothers, your basically only choose which weapon to start the mission...
-It had that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing, if your pre-ordered with gold edition you got 3 or 4 days in advance which is a petty move to do in this days... no I will not pay more 30 Euros for skins and 3 days of early access.

This is one of those times when I wish there was a middle ground between Recommended and Not Recommended. Aside from what are largely circumstantial issues, such as the Epic Games integration and performance problems that some people are having, neither of which I have personally had a problem with; there are things that this game does right, and things that it does worse than the first game. I don't normally write reviews, and especially ones that are longer than a few sentences, but I feel like I have to say at least a few things about every general aspect of the game here.

To start with the good sides:
- Story: It serves its predecessor well, it answers a lot of questions with some subtle references which I really liked, and is overall well written, especially when compared to some of the recent 40k lore.
- Visuals: The sense of scale is impressive, the fidelity is as you would expect from a AAA title, and the animation work is unique in the sense that it doesn't necessarily copy from either Space Marine or Astartes, but has its unique take on depicting space marines which is fluid and satisfying.
- Audio: It's not on the same level as Darktide, especially in the soundtrack, but it gets the job done quite well in a lot of places. There are a few disappointing sounds, like the heavy bolter, but it otherwise manages to feel atmospheric.

Now the bad or mediocre sides:
- Gameplay: It's so hit and miss. When you break it down on paper, it sounds good, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The ranged combat is okay; the weapons are a bit too inaccurate during longer bursts for being carried by the superhuman warriors that space marines are, and most of them feel the same, with a lot feeling like they're less powerful than their counterparts in the first game, or fulfilling a purpose that another weapon can fulfill better. It's the melee combat that is the main problem. You're better off playing it like Dark Souls and rolling around, both in PVE and PVE, because parry is simply too inconsistent. It doesn't matter if you perfectly time your parry if you are already playing an animation, like an attack, because you cannot cancel that animation. This problem gets worse when the attacks, even for the knife and chainsword, are much slower and clunkier than their counterparts in the first game. Additionally, in PVE, enemies can interrupt your attacks by hitting you, but you cannot interrupt theirs using the same method, which makes it not only feel unfair, but also weightless. The animation-pause does more to hurt the experience than help, as timing gets offset every time you hit something. Finally, melee in PVP can be cheated easily by just rolling, kind of like you can cheat the PVE by just rolling. Do not even try for parrying, it's a gamble. All of this makes the combat feel unfinished or badly designed, and I really hope this is addressed because it is currently my biggest pet peeve about the gameplay.
- Customisation: Nonexistent for Chaos, and practically nonexistent for space marines. With Chaos, each class is limited to a warband, so if you're playing a raptor for example, you will be a Night Lord. You can change colours, but you will still retain Night Lord model pieces, same goes for the other classes and warbands. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist for Chaos. For the Primaris, it is also very lackluster. There are less options than there were in the first game, and they're lacking in the variety department, especially when it comes to chapter-specific content. Also, please, for the love of the Emperor, give us back Space Marines. Not Primaris. Space Marines. Not everyone likes the Primaris designs, and I certainly don't. But I feel like this would fall on deaf ears, it's not like GW ever listens to what the community wants.

Overall, it's a decent game. It's hard to judge because there are parts that are very good, and then there's a couple parts that are really bad, and it's hard to dictate which one outweighs the other because they're largely dependent on what the user expects from the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not a Souls-like player and I usually gravitate towards the medium difficulty settings of a game. So when I tell you that I find this game highly satisfying for the challenge it provides, take that as you will.

There are 3 primary game modes:

1) Campaign. The campaign is fun, but rather short. The game itself is highly cinematic, so it feels HIGHLY cinematic in the best way. Recommended to play with friends, as the bots are fairly incompetent when you need them most (the most annoying enemies, the mini bosses, and the bosses). There is very little replayability here, as none of the unlocking or leveling mechanisms in the other parts of the game apply to the campaign and it's very linear. But there are some amazing moments that I will literally never forget, so I recommend playing it.

2) Operations. This is a PVE setting somewhat akin to L4D or Darktide that I find to be the meat and potatoes of the game. On the scale of a lifetime gamer who does not revel in the hardest games or bragging about how good I am at hard games, I found this game mode to be VERY challenging. Here more than anywhere else, you will be forced to play a certain way in order to thrive. That said, the feeling of accomplishment I get out of winning rounds at the highest difficulties is very good, and there are a ton of crunchy weapon leveling mechanisms and class perks to fine tune.

A recent patch was released with some amazing free content, but also with a significant difficulty spike that catered to a loud minority of players. More than a mere difficulty spike, it sought to increase difficulty by making the player less effective rather than making the enemy more dangerous (it did some of both to be fair). The result for me was that I almost quit the game. Fortunately, the devs listened to the community outcry and reversed many of the changes in record time. To me the game still has not fully been returned to its former state of perfect balance, but I'm optimistic for future patches. Class and weapon balance is severely lacking (only 2 classes have effective ranged defenses, making the other 4 classes highly ineffective against the Chaos faction, which is heavily focused on range attacks for example). Still, on the balance, all difficulties are beatable and this game mode is fun and rewarding. When I need to let off steam, there is little more satisfying than parrying, pummeling down, and executing a Tyranid warrior or Lictor.

3) PVP. I'm not a huge PVP guy but I've played a few hours of it. I found it rather simplistic. You will play as a space marine or chaos marine, at random. Strangely, the incredible depth of customization that is available to your space marines is NOT available to you if you happen to get assigned Chaos Marines. There is a separate leveling mechanic in PVP vs PVE, which felt dissatisfying to me when I gave it a try after 100 hours of PVE.

Overall, this is a great game with a lot of flaws, deeply satisfying and often frustrating. The devs really listen to the community, which, as long as they don't revert to catering to the self-titled ""hardcore"" minority, can only lead to more positive growth.

Maybe, if we're really really lucky, we'll even get to play as Terminators one day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 est tout simplement Ã©pique. L'action est brutale, rapide, et on se sent vraiment comme un Space Marine, Ã©crasant les ennemis dans un dÃ©luge de violence. Les graphismes sont magnifiques, et l'ambiance sombre et oppressante de l'univers de Warhammer 40K est parfaitement retranscrite.

Les combats sont un vrai point fort : fluides et satisfaisants, avec une bonne variÃ©tÃ© d'armes et d'ennemis qui poussent Ã  sâ€™adapter constamment. L'histoire est bien ficelÃ©e et offre de grands moments d'adrÃ©naline, le tout servi par une bande-son Ã©pique qui renforce l'immersion.

CÃ´tÃ© nÃ©gatif, il y a quelques moments oÃ¹ l'action peut devenir rÃ©pÃ©titive, notamment lors des vagues d'ennemis. De plus, certains aspects des commandes pourraient Ãªtre mieux optimisÃ©s sur PC.

MalgrÃ© ces petits dÃ©fauts, Space Marine 2 est un incontournable pour tout fan de Warhammer 40K ou de jeux d'action intense. Si vous aimez l'univers sombre et violent de Warhammer et que vous avez soif de combats nerveux, ce jeu est fait pour vous. Ã€ vos bolters, prÃ©parez-vous Ã  dÃ©fendre lâ€™Imperium !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROS
+ Simulador de marine espacial
+ Tanto el modo campaÃ±a como el modo operaciones se pueden jugar en cooperativo
+ Las clases son muy diferentes entre sÃ­, con habilidades y equipo diferente, pudiendo mejorarse o personalizarse
+ El combate cuerpo a cuerpo se siente muy satisfactorio, especialmente las eliminaciones
+ Suficiente complejidad en los niveles de Operaciones como para necesitar de estrategia
+ EstÃ©ticamente el universo de Warhammer 40K es una gozada
+ Aunque simple, cuenta con modo PvP, que alarga la vida del juego

CONTRAS
- La historia de la campaÃ±a, aunque mejor que la del primer tÃ­tulo, sigue siendo un poco sosa (excepto la Ãºltima misiÃ³n)
- La personalizaciÃ³n de tu marine espacial estÃ¡ mÃ¡s limitada que en Space Marine I (ciertos colores o capÃ­tulos son de pago)
- Las 6 misiones del modo Operaciones saben a poco

Ã‰ incrÃ­vel como um jogo com tÃ£o pouco conteÃºdo narrativo consegue compensar com um design robusto e gameplay divertida. Como alguÃ©m que recentemente mergulhou nesse universo, os grÃ¡ficos sÃ£o impressionantes e direcionados a criar uma atmosfera caÃ³tica, tal qual Ã© a vida de um Space Marine..

A campanha Ã© curta, mas dentro do suficiente para a proposta do jogo. Com inÃ­cio, meio e fim, apresenta com bases memorÃ¡veis seus personagens. Seu PVE tem relaÃ§Ã£o com a campanha e se destaca por ser bem desafiante em nÃ­veis maiores.

JÃ¡ o PVP, ao menos no perÃ­odo em que joguei, foi um show a parte. Extremamente divertido e sem frescura. Todos os modos de jogo sÃ£o bem feitos.

Talvez o Ãºnico ponto negativo de desse jogo Ã© a falta de uma trilha sonora que o tornasse ainda mais Ãºnico em um mercado de padrÃµes. Definitivamente, Space Marine 2 nÃ£o estÃ¡ aqui para agradar as massas. Sua Ãºnica proposta Ã© ser divertido, e nesse quesito ele Ã© altamente recomendÃ¡vel.

Conquistas/100%: Seu 100% nÃ£o tem nada de complicado, a maior parte vai ser farm. Um destaque para a conquista ''Impiedoso'' que pode ser o grande empecilho para os completistas futuramente, com o tempo pode ser que se torne difÃ­cil fazer a sequÃªncia de abates no PVP sem morrer. A conquista ''Acabe com eles'' Ã© recomendÃ¡vel que nÃ£o marque os inimigos da campanha no modo operaÃ§Ãµes (HÃ¡ uma possibilidade de nÃ£o contabilizar o inimigo no modo operaÃ§Ãµes). Quanto a conquista de abater 41k de inimigos, existe um glitch na campanha bem fÃ¡cil para se fazer essa quantidade em pouco tempo.

O que Ã© a sua vida? Minha honra Ã© minha vida.
Qual Ã© o seu destino? Meu dever Ã© meu destino.
O que vocÃª teme? Meu temor Ã© fracassar.
Qual Ã© a sua recompensa? Minha salvaÃ§Ã£o Ã© minha recompensa.
Qual Ã© seu ofÃ­cio? Meu ofÃ­cio Ã© a morte.
Qual Ã© seu voto? Meu voto Ã© o serviÃ§o eterno.

Jogo incrÃ­vel!

Que esse jogo fique de exemplo para outras produtoras de como lanÃ§ar um jogo funcional. Space Marine 2 Ã© um jogo completo. NÃ£o lanÃ§aram metade do jogo, nÃ£o Ã© um early acess ou coisa do tipo. Ã‰ realmente um jogo completo e polido sendo lanÃ§ado.

Vamos para os fatos:

Space Marine 2 Ã© bom em todos os aspectos! A Gameplay Ã© Ã³tima, os grÃ¡ficos sÃ£o lindos e a trilha sonora Ã© espetacular (Diria que Ã© o ponto alto do jogo) e a histÃ³ria Ã© muito boa tambÃ©m. AmbientaÃ§Ã£o incrÃ­vel e hordas absurdas. Esse jogo Ã© um daqueles poucos jogos que realmente te colocam na aÃ§Ã£o. VocÃª se sente lÃ¡ dentro!

Um detalhe importante: VocÃª consegue tranquilamente jogar esse jogo single player! PorÃ©m esse jogo Ã© bem mais divertido se jogado com amigos. Eleva muito a gameplay vocÃª conseguir bolar tÃ¡ticas e combinar posicionamento com os amigos.

Ele Ã© bem amigÃ¡vel se vocÃª nÃ£o jogou o primeiro, porÃ©m eu recomendo DEMAIS vocÃª dar uma olhada bÃ¡sica na lore do Warhammer 40K porque tem muita coisa coisa legal que rola no jogo que o jogo nÃ£o necessariamente te explica.

Vale muito a pena! Esse universo Ã© incrÃ­vel e o jogo Ã© maravilhoso. Poucos jogos eu aconselho a comprar no preÃ§o cheio e esse aqui Ã© um deles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello,

En quelques mots...

SynthÃ¨se :
Le jeu est pas mal mais c'est Ã  mon sens surtout un bon dÃ©fouloir sous licence Warhammer.
Dans ce genre, il est bon, dynamique et impressionnant avec des scÃ¨nes sanglantes, des combo sympa, du bon bourrinage, etc. Mais c'est Ã  peu prÃ¨s tout. Et surtout, on en fait vite le tour et on le ressent.
Je prÃ©cise que je donne mon avis sur le fond et non la forme qui reste jouissive et stylÃ©e.

NB : je changerais peut-Ãªtre la note en fonction des mises Ã  jour et ajouts possibles.

Pour en revenir Ã  mon point de vue, le jeu me semble incomplet et sur-cÃ´tÃ© Ã  l'heure oÃ¹ j'Ã©cris ces lignes (""warhammer 40K fan service bonjour"").
Le jeu est beau et Ã  peu prÃ¨s stable (quelques bugs de dÃ©but de jeu, on peut penser que cela ne va pas durer.
Exemples : plantage sans raison en cours de parties, certains modes de pvp qui tournent dans le vide (aucun lancement possible), temps de chargement affreusement longs, etc.




Elle est cousue de fil blanc voire insipide, donc Ã  faire 1 fois. Ne serait-ce car elle introduit les classes et les opÃ©rations.
Si vous avez fait Space Marines 1er du nom, aucune surprise scÃ©naristique.
Mais il n'est pas nÃ©cessaire d'avoir fait le 1er, l'actuelle histoire se suffit Ã  elle-mÃªme.




Il s'agit de missions dites ""OpÃ©rations"" : elles se passent en parallÃ¨le de l'histoire principale.
Il y a 6 classes, avec leurs spÃ©cificitÃ©s (et non, pas de construction de classe possible, j'en vois dÃ©jÃ  espÃ©rer ^^).
> Chacune a aussi 1 capacitÃ© spÃ©ciale Ã  activer.

Il est bon de prÃ©ciser qu'une escouade (de 3 donc) ne peut compter plus d'une classe unique.
Une mÃªme classe ne peut pas Ãªtre prÃ©sente plus d'une fois : pas de doublon, pas plus mal ?
L'esprit de la coop' est sympa.

CÃ´tÃ© environnements :

Pas d'environnement ""surprise"" ou dynamique.
Il s'agit d'une sÃ©rie de couloirs, ni plus, ni moins.
Saviez-vous qu'un Space Marines peut casser un mur d'un simple coup de pied mais ne peut pas passer Ã  travers un buisson ou pousser un tas petits tonneaux ? ==> murs invisibles en pagaille ? Oui.

De mÃªme, vous n'avez pas le choix et le scÃ©nario est Ã©crit d'avance.
Il n'y a qu'un seul objectif principal et les objectifs secondaires sont obligatoires puisque couloir, donc chacun est nÃ©cessaire au prochain. :D

Il y a 6 cartes pour le moment mais d'autres vont arriver. Je crains hÃ©las que l'effet couloir soit conservÃ©.

Il y a aussi plusieurs niveaux de difficultÃ© (4 mais bientÃ´t 5), c'est lÃ  que l'aspect coopÃ©ration prend tout son sens au fur et Ã  mesure de l'avancÃ©e.

Il y a Ã©videmment un principe de niveaux avec un dÃ©diÃ© au personnage, un autre dÃ©diÃ© aux armes.
Mais les 2 fonctionnent de concert.

Pour les armes :


Comme non mentionnÃ© : il n'y a pas de systÃ¨me d'armure en tant que tel (exp : +% Ã  la rÃ©sistance Ã  l'acide ? C'est non).

Pour le personnage :




ProblÃ¨me : pour avancer, il va falloir farmer. Et c'est un doux euphÃ©misme.
> Tout d'abord car il faut beaucoup de certains Ã©lÃ©ments trouvables uniquement en pve mais cachÃ© dans des recoins de la carte (qu'on connaÃ®t dÃ©jÃ  mais il faut quand mÃªme chercher car le petit bonus se cache :p) et sur les boss (donc plus ""facile"" quand la difficultÃ© augmente, couloirs obligent).
> Il y a aussi une sorte de monnaie - utilisable d'ailleurs pour les skins (on y reviendra) - mais qui se fait beaucoup plus rapidement en pvp, au moins sur toute la premiÃ¨re partie.

Et sans transition...




Il s'agit ni plus ni moins que d'un TPS trÃ¨s moyen avec les 6 classes et leur compÃ©tence unique (j'ai quelques titres en tÃªte).
Pas d'armes Ã  amÃ©liorer (!) ni de talents mais des niveaux de personnages afin de dÃ©bloquer certaines armes (et skins) propres Ã  la classe.
D'ailleurs, l'Ã©quilibrage paraÃ®t difficile tant le jeu est orientÃ© coop Ã  la base. Quoi que... ;)

Seulement quelques cartes pour le moment et de niveau assez inÃ©gal.
Il est dÃ©jÃ  annoncÃ© que d'autres feront leur apparition.

Enfin, le cÃ´tÃ© Spaces Marines vs. Spaces Marines du Chaos est sympathique.



La customisation du personnage est peut-Ãªtre l'aspect le plus mis en avant (avec le cÃ´tÃ© sanglant / dynamique des combats).

Avec la monnaie du jeu Ã©voquÃ©e, il n'est pas seulement possible d'amÃ©liorer ses armes mais... de dÃ©bloquer couleurs et Ã©lÃ©ments dÃ©coratifs et de crÃ©er votre propre Spaces Marines (inventer le Chapitre le plus fou ! ^^).

Il y a quelques points Ã  bien diffÃ©rencier :







Il y a dÃ©jÃ  une ressemblance avec un certain Doom - pour les connaisseurs. ;)

Prenons en vrac :










Le jeu n'est pas mauvais mais il n'est pas aussi bon qu'annoncÃ©.
La hype l'a fait monter en flÃ¨che Ã  grands coups d'images bourrines et de customisation mais il ne s'agit que d'un nouveau dÃ©fouloir.

Je ne le conseille pas en tant que tel car ses dÃ©faut sont Ã  mon sens assez/trop gÃªnants et qu'il me semble qu'il y a eu tromperie sur la marchandise.

L'effet couloir et le manque de diversitÃ© a Ã©tÃ© une rÃ©elle dÃ©ception (pour moi).
Il n'Ã©tait pas utile d'en faire des caisses mais lÃ ...
Â« C'est tout droit mes frÃ¨res ! Tout droit ! Â»

Je reconnais que je vais encore y jouer pour le cÃ´tÃ© dÃ©fouloir mais... Sans plus.

Comme prÃ©cisÃ©, j'attends aussi de voir la suite.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A masterpiece that is so rare in today's gaming landscape - reminiscent of a time we called the ""golden age of gaming"" with absolute Warhammer 40K brutality that we all love.

Graphics
â€?Incredible model detail everywhere
â€?High fidelity and dense environments
â€?Loincloth physics is ğŸ‘Œ
â€?World just looks amazingly beautiful - sheer scale 'shock and awe' at every horizon

Gameplay
â€?Simple but satisfying, much polished from Space Marine I
â€?Movement feels super satisfying and heavy as an Astartes should
â€?Gunplay is impactful and smooth, though aiming feels a bit clunky at times due to the way it's configured
â€?Melee is a transcendent experience, as the Emperor intended, with all the right splashes of red
â€?Old school gaming feel, this plays like a true Space Marine successor/sequel should


â€?Well-paced, Titus, Chairon, and Chadriel have some amazing moments in this campaign to save the Recidious System from annihilation by xenos and Choas scum alike
â€?Background characters like Major Sarkaana, Cpt. Sevastus Acheran and others aboard the battle barge were all memorable in their own rights - though many Ultramarines don the same Primaris power armour their dialogues and faces behind the suit intrigued me enough to warrant their own spin-off campaigns if possible
â€?World-building elements in the story campaign created a larger-than-life immersive experience, thanks to the attention-to-detail when designing the objects in the game - everything feels so authentic to the 41st millennium time period
â€?Epic, grand, dazzling - are all words that are too small to describe the awe I felt when finishing the campaign, it was a religious experience to say the least
â€?Too short, would have loved a longer campaign - easily finish-able in a day. Hopefully future expansions could be added that bring fourth more stories in this game/engine.

Overall, this was the successor to Space Marine that was worth waiting 13 years for - in fact there was a time when this game would not have been possible and to see it and play it is a blessing and a great privilege. For anyone who is a fan of the 40K universe I say this is a must buy - my only complaint is that it will leave you wanting more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really like the game. I do wish the campaign offered more of a sense of progression and customization and rewards for completing missions in it other than just knowing you did so plus the accompanying achievement on whatever platform you might be playing the game. That aside, the first couple missions of the campaign I did were pretty fun and then I started doing Operations and never really felt a desire to go back to campaign.

In Operations, you get 6 different classes to play as and level up, with their own perks and 3 loadouts for each class to choose what weapons you want to bring into a mission. You'll be able to swap to any of those loadouts during various predetermined points in the mission and even if you don't want to change loadouts, you can at least use it to reload your ammo. Even if you fail an Operation, you get credit for each part of it you completed, and awarded some xp based on how far into it you got before you all died. If you win, obviously you get the normal amount awarded for completing that tier of difficulty and even more if you find a Gene Seed on the map during your run and whoever is carrying it doesn't die before the end of the Op. If you find a Gene Seed, be warned that you can't also carry a Guardian Relic-the item you can find on maps that can be used to revive yourself if you get downed. Scattered around the maps can be crates that can be smashed and often hold anything from ammo packs to med kits to the different types of grenades: shock, frag, krak (sticky), and melta bombs.

The xp you get for completing the Operation goes not just to your class of Space Marine, but your weapons used as well. Any class able to use the same weapons as another will benefit from that weapon xp and unlocks as well, meaning you can spend all your time with a chainsword on one class and switch to another at level 1, but still use the higher tier chainsword you unlocked with the higher level class. Once you level up a weapon, you get a Mastery Point to use to unlock a perk on the weapon. The more versions of that weapon you master, the more points you get to spend on perks that further upgrade any version of that weapon you use. Ranged weapons and melee weapons can each have at least 1 other version you can craft that works a little bit differently in combat once you unlock the 2nd tier of weapons. Melee weapons can often also have a different version that offers a block instead of a parry (at least judging by the description in game and how it's seemed to function so far). For example, I just got to the 3rd tier of weapons and made a force sword that hits nearly twice as hard as the one I was using before, but it's speed is at least 3 times slower according to the stats, and you can definitely feel it in combat. Even if it looks like there's only about a dozen or so different weapons in the game, you will be able to make a decent amount of different kinds that play quite differently from each other to keep the combat feeling fresh even beyond having 6 different classes and therefore 6 abilities to choose from.

I've mainly been playing the Bulwark class cause I liked the sword and shield combo it offered at first, but over time have really grown to love not only how powerful it's shield is (can block sniper fire-sure it staggers me, but i don't take any damage) but how good it's ability it. It can be upgraded to not only revive downed allies, but fully restore Contested Health of any allies within it's radius when used, plus deal damage over time to enemies within it's area of effect. Contested Health is HP you can recover if you deal damage within a short amount of time (or get a finisher) and it quickly fades over time, but again, the Bulwark can get a perk that slows that rate by 50%. There's currently no medic or dedicated healer class in the game, but the Bulwark is the next best thing for now and it's honestly not a bad substitute. My main gripe with it is there's a perk it can get that drops a shock grenade when it's armor pops, but that shock grenade also damages me when it drops. Not my allies-just me, it seems. I hope/assume it's a bug and not the intended design, because it can really get you into trouble at low health.

The Operations themselves are supposed to be unlocked alongside the main story as you play thru it, but I chose to just play my way thru the first 4 before I stopped and definitely not because I lost that one. Each one I played was not only pretty different from the others in terms of what was being done during the mission, but a decent 20-40 minutes in length depending on how things play out and how mean it wants to be to you. It can get pretty difficult at times, especially going from tier 2 to tier 3 in the levels of difficulty. I haven't tried the final tier/level of difficulty yet, but I can only imagine how much more difficult it gets. Just going to tier 2 ""average"" difficulty, there was a noticeable spike in how hard it was, plus how much less stuff there was and how much less the health kits restored-speaking of, you no longer dropped in with a free med kit from average difficulty on up. The higher difficulties are definitely more rewarding to play, though. Not just in terms of xp and extra coins, but how fun and brutally hard they can be and how satisfying it can be to survive waves and encounters in it.

The coins you get from completing Operations successfully and from playing pvp matches can be spent on unlocking new cosmetics for your Space Marines as well as new weapons for them to use to gain more mastery points for weapon perks. They're also used for unlocking perks on each of your 6 classes, so you'll probably be going thru a lot of them. Fortunately you can also get up to 75 coins per class if you complete each of their trials-they're little tutorials on how to better play as each class since each class plays so differently from each other.

I tried a couple matches of the pvp with a friend and while I thoroughly lost both of them-especially the first one-I had a lot of fun and want to play more of it. It feels kind of like third person Halo Reach multiplayer with more melee focused combat. You definitely have more of a chance to tank some shots than something like Call of Duty, but you and enemies aren't bullet sponges. It feels very fair in how they approached it as well. From what little I saw, it seems like you have your own progression system for pvp and you unlock more weapons to use in it. Even if you lose, you get xp based on what you do and if you do well, you're still rewarded for it. How do you ""do well"" things as simple as healing a teammate with the Bulwark's ability, assists, and of course kills, but also objectives, avenging allies-basically all the things that would get you those medals in Halo multiplayer would go towards giving you xp.

With only 6 Operations and 3 pvp modes, I was worried the game wouldn't have enough content to keep me interested for a while because I was expecting something more like their WWZ game where the main story missions basically were the main operations you did and then they had horde mode as another mode you could play-but I really think they structured things in such a way that it will offer a decent amount of replayability and keep enough people interested for long enough to feel like it was worth their money even if they decide to not finish the main campaign.

That said, I think starting things off with a forced campaign tutorial and then wanting you to play the first campaign mission before unlocking the first Operation was a bad decision. They should have dumped you straight onto the battle barge and let you at least do the first Operation and saved the whole forced tutorial and ""play a mission to unlock an Operation"" mechanic for after your first Operation rather than doing it the other way around. ---

I've run out of room for review. Go check out the game if you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

geiles game! Ich hab 0 Probleme mit der Performance konstante 120+ fps :) vielleicht solltet ihr mal etwas AufrÃ¼sten und nicht direkt das Game schlecht bewerten, weil ihr noch mit einer 1070 zockt xD

Und es war ja klar das die Server am Anfang etwas Ã¼berlastet sind aber wegen sowas das Game schlecht zu bewerten ist eigentlich echt Traurig :(
Abgesehen davon hatte ich persÃ¶nlich keine Probleme mit den Servern und Gruppen erstellen mit freunden.

aber vom Gameplay ist es ne Mischung aus World War Z und Darktide! Kann ich nur Empfehlen.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 â€?Ä°lk Ä°zlenim Ä°ncelemesi

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, uzun sÃ¼redir beklenen ve ilk oyunun hayranlarÄ±nÄ±n sabÄ±rsÄ±zlÄ±kla takip ettiÄŸi bir devam oyunu. Ä°lk oyundaki aksiyon dolu ve yoÄŸun savaÅŸ atmosferi bu oyunda da aynen devam ediyor, ancak bu sefer yeni mekanikler, geliÅŸmiÅŸ grafikler ve daha derin bir hikaye ile karÅŸÄ±mÄ±za Ã§Ä±kÄ±yor.

Grafik ve Atmosfer
Space Marine 2, gÃ¶rsel olarak oldukÃ§a etkileyici. Oyun, Warhammer 40K evreninin karanlÄ±k ve gotik estetiÄŸini baÅŸarÄ±yla yansÄ±tÄ±yor. DetaylÄ± Ã§evre tasarÄ±mÄ±, devasa savaÅŸ alanlarÄ± ve Tyranidâ€™lerin Ã¼rpertici tasarÄ±mlarÄ± ile oyunun atmosferi inanÄ±lmaz derecede yoÄŸun. Daha Ã¶nce ""World War Z"" oyununda da kullanÄ±lan ""Swarm Engine"" sayesinde, karakter animasyonlarÄ± ve patlamalar gerÃ§ekÃ§i ve etkileyici gÃ¶rÃ¼nÃ¼yor. Ã–zellikle bolca kullanÄ±lan kan ve parÃ§alanma efektleri, Space Marine 2'yi tam anlamÄ±yla bir gÃ¶rsel ÅŸÃ¶len haline getiriyor.

OynanÄ±ÅŸ
OynanÄ±ÅŸ aÃ§Ä±sÄ±ndan, Space Marine 2 ilk oyunun aksiyon dolu tarzÄ±nÄ± koruyor. Yine bir Space Marine olarak Tyranid'lere karÅŸÄ± destansÄ± savaÅŸlara giriyorsunuz. YakÄ±n dÃ¶vÃ¼ÅŸ silahlarÄ±, aÄŸÄ±r makineli tÃ¼fekler ve plazma silahlarÄ± gibi ikonik Warhammer silahlarÄ±nÄ± kullanmak, savaÅŸ sahnelerini daha da heyecanlÄ± hale getiriyor. YÃ¼ksek tempolu, kanlÄ± savaÅŸlar ilk oyunun ruhunu canlÄ± tutuyor. Ancak yeni eklenen kombolar ve daha akÄ±cÄ± kontrol mekanikleri sayesinde dÃ¶vÃ¼ÅŸler Ã§ok daha akÄ±cÄ± ve keyifli bir hal almÄ±ÅŸ.

DÃ¼ÅŸman Ã§eÅŸitliliÄŸi de oldukÃ§a etkileyici. Tyranidâ€™lerin farklÄ± tÃ¼rleri, her biri farklÄ± taktikler gerektiren Ã§eÅŸitli savaÅŸ senaryolarÄ± sunuyor. Devasa boss savaÅŸlarÄ± ise oyuna epik bir his katÄ±yor.

Hikaye ve Atmosfer
Warhammer 40K evreninin derinliÄŸi, oyunun hikayesine de yansÄ±mÄ±ÅŸ durumda. Hikaye, baÅŸ karakterimiz Titus'un etrafÄ±nda ÅŸekilleniyor ve onu, Tyranid istilasÄ±na karÅŸÄ± savaÅŸÄ±rken gÃ¶rÃ¼yoruz. Oyunun atmosferi, gotik bilimkurgu ve kaosun birleÅŸimiyle oldukÃ§a kasvetli ve yoÄŸun bir his veriyor. Ã–zellikle Warhammer evrenine hakim olan oyuncular iÃ§in bu atmosfer bÃ¼yÃ¼k bir artÄ± olacak.

Ã‡oklu Oyuncu Modu
Ä°lk oyunda olduÄŸu gibi Ã§ok oyunculu mod, Space Marine 2'nin en heyecan verici yanlarÄ±ndan biri. ArkadaÅŸlarÄ±nÄ±zla birlikte devasa Tyranid sÃ¼rÃ¼lerine karÅŸÄ± hayatta kalma mÃ¼cadelesi vermek oldukÃ§a tatmin edici ve eÄŸlenceli. AyrÄ±ca kooperatif modunda ekipman ve karakter Ã¶zelleÅŸtirmeleri de oyunun Ã§ok oyunculu kÄ±smÄ±nÄ± Ã§eÅŸitlendiriyor. PVP'si de ayrÄ± bir keyifli. Ã–zellikle COD gibi fast-pace oyunlardan sÄ±kÄ±ldÄ±ysanÄ±z, dÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼k temposu, yavaÅŸ movementÄ± ve takÄ±m bazlÄ± Ã§atÄ±ÅŸmalar size ilaÃ§ gibi gelecektir.

SonuÃ§
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, ilk oyunun hayranlarÄ±nÄ± memnun edecek ÅŸekilde tasarlanmÄ±ÅŸ ve yeni nesil teknolojilerle gÃ¼Ã§lendirilmiÅŸ bir devam oyunu. YÃ¼ksek tempolu aksiyon, gÃ¶rsel ÅŸÃ¶len sunan savaÅŸ sahneleri ve Warhammer 40K evreninin karanlÄ±k atmosferi, oyunu baÅŸarÄ±lÄ± bir deneyim haline getiriyor. Warhammer 40K evrenine aÅŸina olmayanlar iÃ§in bile, yoÄŸun savaÅŸ mekanikleri ve etkileyici gÃ¶rsellerle dolu bir aksiyon oyunu olarak dikkat Ã§ekiyor.

EÄŸer aksiyon dolu bir Ã¼Ã§Ã¼ncÃ¼ ÅŸahÄ±s niÅŸancÄ± oyunu arÄ±yorsanÄ±z ve Warhammer evreninin fanÄ±ysanÄ±z, ""Space Marine 2"" tam size gÃ¶re olabilir.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 is a fantastic game that excels in both graphics and gameplay. The visuals are stunning, with detailed environments and smooth animations, while the combat feels satisfying and intense, perfectly capturing the Warhammer 40k universe.

However, there are a couple of drawbacks: the lack of a field-of-view (FOV) slider and no ultrawide support. Despite these minor issues, the game delivers a thrilling and immersive experience for fans of the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I am biased on the basis of nostalgia, this game not only nails the spirit of the first game but also knocks it out of the park in terms of gameplay and the single-player campaign narrative.

Whats more the Developers are looking to support this game on the long term for more content, classes, etc - and are actively listening to their community for direction!

So yeah, I'd put this at a solid 10/10 no question",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a great game, visually stunning, and has a sound design that is meaty, metallic, and manly. the story is ok made great by the visuals and staging.

Biggest critiques: NO FOV SLIDER! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the character takes up like 1/3 of the screen, also the gameplay after finishing the story and doing the Operations is kinda repetitive not much changes once you've completed the current 6 Ops, I've yet to progress through all the perks and weapon trees which may add flavour to the moment to moment gameplay but wouldn't change what you're doing in the Ops.

I'm not a big PvP guy, especially in 3rd person shooters but it's pretty good, I use it to take a break from the repetitiveness of Ops",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A shooter that truely pumps up your dopamine levels.

The guns connect, the melee feels nice, executions look wonderful, breathtaking atmosphere with a brutal no nonsense warhammer playstyle. Playing this game solo is fun but it's definitely designed to play with your friends in a co-op. It makes the gunblasting so much more satisfying.

There's definitely some tweaks needed in buffing some weapons/perks/health systems.. Some classes outshine others. But overall the game is really polished from the start.

Can't wait for all the promised content they showed on the roadmap, gonna be a blast!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lore wize its a great 40K game and it was beutifully executed in visuals and stability, good microtransactions policy and great content yet to be released.

However, i dont feel like a space marine when i play it anymore. The weapons don't feel impactfull, melee feels like a gentle massage on most of the enemies and a smal group of the weakest ones is capable of taking you down very fast and easilly.

Moreover, Saber Interactive, repeating the same mistakes of Arrowhead on the Nerfdivers fiasco, listened to the sweaty try hard minority of the comunity, and just released an update bumping up even more the dificulty across the board, Making you feel more like a guardsman than an Astates.

Not the game i bought, not the power fantasy i wanted to play anymore.

UPDATE:
Recently i received an answer from the developer:

Brother Numitor [developer] Posted: 26 Oct @ 7:02pm
Hello Cisco,

Thank you for the comments on the game. The feedback from our battle brothers is always welcome, and used for future updates of the game, and this time it'll be no different.

Also, I'm glad to inform that patch 4.1 fixed the balancing of the weapons in the game.

Please keep the comments coming, brother!

The Emperor Protects.

After this answer, I went back into the game, played one mission with each class, played the new mission and tested the new gun. My impression was that nothing about the game feel had changed.
My previous review / recommendation stands: Im not looking to play SPACE MARINE to feel weaker than a Helldiver, I feel more powerfull and have more fun playing Ogrin in Darktide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't have many hours played yet but I don't need to. When you experience greatness you feel it from first moments. This game is what I hoped for and more than I expected. There are some issues with game stability but we are in very early stage of game life so it's understandable. Game is fun and with proper support from Mechanicum it will provide us, loyal servants of the Emperor, decent amount of pleasure from ripping chaos traitors apart with new weapons and in new stylish armor.

Just don't make them too stylish - cough <Fulgrim> cough cough -.

I approve and recommend this game for further distribution on remaining imperial worlds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is from a co-op PVE perspective, if you are here for the single player, it's good, get the game.

Initially this is a good, fun game but the higher difficulties were incredibly difficult which made me simply not want to bother playing anymore. Matchmaking didn't seem to work most of the time and the bots literally did nothing and armor would only protect a single hit except from the most damaging attacks which could take more.

Patch 3.0 changed the armor to work like you would expect, an extended health bar, and vastly improved the bots and made them actually do something. The game was suddenly way easier on the highest difficulties and you could actually progress. Honestly bots were usually better than the players I got matched with.

Patch 4.0 doesn't list any bot AI changes, but they seem like they are back to doing nothing.

Just had an amazing 5-hour co-op campaign experience with my two bros (and still have more to do in the following days to come). I haven't had such good, visceral, fun, challenging combat like this in a long time with them in a game like this - it deserves the highest praise out there for including the co-op campaign as a feature from the beginning. Be sure to play this on the hardest difficulty setting when with other players," you'll get the proper sense of accomplishment after completing a mission then.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game is an incredible sequel to a great game from 13 years ago however my biggest issue is in regards to the multiplayer and that's the fact that there's almost no customisation for the Chaos Space Marines and there's literally only 3 maps.
Despite this there's still a great foundation and I hope they expand upon it in future updates.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Veramente molto bello, intriso della pura Lore di WH40k che si respira da ogni singolo pixel durante tutto il corso della campagna e delle operazioni.
Ottimizzato bene (con una 3060, tutto ad alto, MAI avuto problemi fino ad ora), divertente, immediato, buon gameplay (per quanto con tastiera e mouse si faccia veramente fatica sia a parare che a schivare e consiglio caldamente di giocarlo con un pad).
Il multiplayer ho avuto modo di provarlo per qualche match e non mi ha preso per niente, trovandolo unicamente una caciara dove muori con 2 colpi e ti vengono praticamente a camperare in base, ma sicuramente verrÃ  fatto qualcosa in futuro per bilanciarlo.

Da prendere come esperienza puramente PVE sperando in forti aggiornamenti di contenuto in futuro.

Assolutamente consigliatissimo.

Prior to the recent patch this was a real blast and just right in my view, adding a new difficulty would have been fine for the tryhards but what has happened here has completely ruined the enjoyment of the game.

Things that were good fun have been nerfed into the ground and the weapons and classes that were crap have remained crap.

This is going the same way that Helldivers did, i don't understand why devs do this and fail to learn from the mistakes that other titles make.

This is being parked until they sort it out and stop pandering to the sweaty 1% who don't live in the real world and have infinite leisure time. Such a shame, gone the exact same way as Helldivers 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II

Pros:
+ Plenty of WH40k lore, references and easter eggs... Warhammer 40k fans will be pleased
+ Truly an epic campaign
+ Looks great
+ Gameplay is solid, brutal, bloody and gives a good challenge on higher difficulties
+ Soundtrack
+ 6 unique classes for PVE and PVP
+ Great optimazation
+ Polished, no bugs ( except Tyranids )


- No Chaos customization in multiplayer, you can only changes their color not a single piece of armor
- Only 3 maps for multiplayer... truly a heresy
- 3 multiplayer modes aren't much better... Team Deatmatch, Capture point and Mobile Capture Point. Truly nothing special.
- For me game takes literally few minutes to quit... faster is just to press ALT+F4
- Though 6 PVE scenarios that we curently have are pretty good, on longer run they will lack replayability


- Campaign takes around ~10 hours to finish
- Multiplayer have 3 maps and 3 game modes
- There's 6 PVE scenarios each take around ~30 minutes
- There's 23 weapons, some are available only in campaign like Flamethrower",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game is great:

- works like a charm (no major bugs)
- great story and narration
- very good graphics
- good optimization
- no stupid propaganda (to hell with Heretics!)
- Awesome Cinematics (specialy near end of a game)



- server efficiency needs more work (lower ping)
- multiplayer PvP needs more modes like a Siege, Capture and Destroy ect.
- mp maps are a bit small and not fully thought out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PLAYED IN COOP:
Gameplay is fine and solid, a pretty enjoyable combat system. Story is exactly what you'd expect, graphics are fine. That's about it.

Optimalization is very subpar.
Connection to online services is very spotty, you'll get stuck at loading screens, disconnected, the ping is not great, etc. It's all hosted on epic online services so go figure.
No FOV slider.
Veteran difficulty does not really make you feel like a space marine, one difficulty level lower is way too easy.

Tyranid section:
Enemies shoot through walls CONSTANTLY, that one elevator section in particular is awful - you have to one-shot it, otherwise after dying you cannot pick-up any medkits/ammo/weapons/etc., it all gets bugged. (reloading the level is not very optimal, the loading screens are so long)
The long-ranged enemies are insanely strong and don't give you too much indication that they are shooting at you. The bigger long-ranged enemies are bullet sponges.
The lyctor boss was underwhelming, repetetive and quite easy. The ""minigun/shotgun"" type enemies the boss spawned in were 100x harder than he was (they melt you down to zero HP in one good burst). They re-use him after as a normal enemy, actually much more fun.
The section with the small critters and the flamethrower was a cool concept but executed extremely poorly - it was more annoying than fun.
The flying enemies have way too much HP.
Teammates missing cutscenes, only see a black screen instead.
The bosses are so uninspired, filled with enemy spam because they are not worth it to fight on their own.

However, after you survive all this bs, the rest of the game is quite enjoyable (the connection and loading issues still persist tho).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Absolutely recommending it.
- For me no bugs, no crashes, no nothing. Runs like a charm.
- Story mode is fantastic.
- Combat is fluid. The system itself is easy, but the fights are exciting.
- Graphics are breathtakingly beautiful.
- Not woke.
- Companion Ai is not the best, but not the dumbest I've ever seen. Could be better.
- Warhammer feeling is great.
- Multiplayer missions are fun.
- It is not a looter shooter.
- They nerfed the difficulty significantly. Right now Ruthless is the highest difficulty and sadly it is not difficult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Le jeu est bien , mais le contenu a l'heure actuel ridicule ce qui mâ€™empÃªche de le recommander.

Niveau histoire : 4 missions d'1 heure une de 2h (1 a 3 joueurs)
Niveau co-op : 6 Missions de 40 minutes a faire en boucle non stop pour up chacune des classes & armes (Ca changera mais pour le moment obligatoire d'Ãªtre 3 joueurs impossible de jouer solo et aucune classe en doublon)

NERDBONER!

If you miss the mid 2000s games like Gear Of War you will love this one! No Coporate greed BS, no DEI, no ""suprise mechanics"", just big dudes killing big things. My updated review after completing the campagin on veteran and countless OP Missions: this is the best non-RTS 40K game out there at the moment! The last view fights of the campaign are the most 40K boner-material there is!!

Gameplay: Art, graphics, music, atmosphere are top notch. Its war everywhere, like it should be, the weapons have a punch, gore is deliciously over the top. Campaign is a little repetitive during the first half, a problem the first game had too. The second half of the game is amazing with new enemies, guns, locations etc.
Corporate greed/BS: No lootboxes, no microtransactions! Campaign can be played offline, OPs with bots.
Bugs: During the campaign I had one animation bug. Multiplayer was great, I had some connection issues once but thats it.
Balancing: The classes need finetuning in OP/MP, also some weapons.
Difficulty: Played campaign on veteran. Its a challenge sometimes, the defense sections can be hard, but otherwise than that its doable.
Multiplayer: Coop so far was VERY fun and this is where SM2 shines the most!

Verdict so far: To my knowledge everything is lore accurate, they went into great detail in this one. Big dudes with bigger weapons killing stuff, this is what I want to see! If you know 40K you will love this game, its a love letter to all the fans!

13 Jahre haben wir gewartet......und es hat sich verdammt nochmal gelohnt.
Beim Gott Imperator, wie geil ist dieses Spiel den, es sieht gut aus, es spielt sich gut und ich hatte keine Technischen Probleme oder Bugs. Es hat sich gelohnt das sie sich die Zeit gelassen haben fÃ¼r das Spiel. Die Kampagne ist ein Wilder Ritt und das Finale ist einfach nur geil. Das Spiel ist eine Liebes ErklÃ¤rung an alle Warhammer Fans, vor allem was die Details angeht. Deutsche und Englische Stimmen sind beide gut und der MP/Koop ist auch gelungen und die Swarm Engine gibt die Tyraniden gut wieder. Von mir aus kann ein Space Marine 3 in dieser Art und Weise gerne kommen oder von mir aus DLC Kampagnen oder zumindest EinsÃ¤tze. Ich mag ja jeden Orden der Space Marines und mit den Blauen Jungs hatte ich meinen heiden SpaÃŸ aber wÃ¤re es nicht geil z.b. in einem Spezial einsatz Space Wolves zu spielen oder gar in einer Kampagne ? Naja man darf ja trÃ¤umen ;) Kann das Spiel nur empfehlen an alle Warhammer Fans den: Wir marschieren fÃ¼r Mcgragge, wir marschieren ohne Furcht, fÃ¼r Ultramar !!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can finally play space marine 2 again! Despite the constant struggles I have had with playing this game as a linux user I would still genuinely recommend playing SM2 if you are a fan of warhammer 40k, the gameplay is fantastic and fun, and the customization with armor is great! Although I'm not a huge fan of the whole season pass exclusive skins, they still look great and, what are you gonna do?
The story is a little bland but fun and enjoyable, the PVP is great, and the PVE is also great!
This game has had a lot of troubles since launch, and it makes me feel like it was not finished, and its a damn shame. I hope there is more support for linux in the future, as well as optimization.
TLDR, yes you should play SM2, but maybe wait for a sale

Also, to my linux siblings, if you are still getting the AVF ERROR code, I used the command 'SteamDeck=1 %command%' and it seemed to fix it! (i'm not actually sure if its supposed to go in the console or in steam settings for the game)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only in death does duty end!

Dla wszystkich, ktÃ³rzy czekali na dalszy ciÄ…g historii kapitana Demetriana Titusa, Saber Interactive postanowiÅ‚ przygotowaÄ‡ chyba jednÄ… z wiÄ™kszych niespodzianek, jeÅ¼eli chodzi o premiery 2024 roku. Ultramarine dubbingowany przez kapitalnego Marka Stronga powraca, a wraz z nim i Wy bÄ™dziecie mieli okazjÄ™ zmierzyÄ‡ siÄ™ z najwiÄ™kszymi wrogami ludzkoÅ›ci w osadzonym w 40 milenium Å›wiecie Warhammera. Czy to udany powrÃ³t? Nie naraÅ¼Ä™ siÄ™ chyba Inkwizycji, jeÅ¼eli powiem - jak najbardziej!

The Emperor protects!

Od wydarzeÅ„ z pierwszej czÄ™Å›ci gry minÄ™Å‚o ponad 200 lat, w trakcie ktÃ³rych Titus odbywaÅ‚ swojÄ… pokutÄ™ w szeregach StraÅ¼y Åšmierci. W grywalnym samouczku towarzyszymy mu w trakcie jednej z operacji, w ktÃ³rej bohater prawie traci Å¼ycie, stajÄ…c twarzÄ… w twarz z przewaÅ¼ajÄ…cymi siÅ‚ami TyranidÃ³w i pojedynkujÄ…c siÄ™ z ogromnym Carnifexem. ""Imperator chroni"" to jednak nie sÄ… sÅ‚owa rzucane na wiatr, wiÄ™c nasz bohater zostaje poskÅ‚adany do kupy na pokÅ‚adzie okrÄ™tu wojennego i po raz kolejny trafia na Å›lad spisku siÅ‚ chaosu.

Szkielet fabuÅ‚y pozostaje tutaj podobny do tego, ktÃ³ry znamy z pierwszej czÄ™Å›ci. Walka z Tyranidami okazuje siÄ™ tylko wstÄ™pem do inwazji siÅ‚ Chaosu, a nierozwaÅ¼ne zabawy z reliktami osnowy, ktÃ³re uskuteczniajÄ… kapÅ‚ani Adeptus Mechanicus jak nic przypominajÄ… graczowi podobne praktyki Inkwizycji z pierwszej czÄ™Å›ci przygÃ³d kosmicznego marine. Akcja pÄ™dzi na tyle wartko, Å¼e zamiast zastanawiaÄ‡ siÄ™ nad meandrami scenariusza i tak raczej rzucicie siÄ™ z mÅ‚otem i bolterem do walki, wiÄ™c zamiast szukaÄ‡ dziur w caÅ‚ym, lepiej spojrzeÄ‡ na to, co stanowi najwaÅ¼niejszÄ… czÄ™Å›Ä‡ rozgrywki - walkÄ™!


Obcych bÄ™dziecie ciÄ…Ä‡, miaÅ¼dÅ¼yÄ‡ i rozrywaÄ‡ na strzÄ™py za pomocÄ… caÅ‚kiem sporego arsenaÅ‚u, zdecydowanie wiÄ™kszego niÅ¼ w pierwszej czÄ™Å›ci. W walce wrÄ™cz skorzystacie z czterech rÃ³Å¼nych rodzajÃ³w orÄ™Å¼a, do tego dojdzie kilka rodzajÃ³w broni bocznej i kilkanaÅ›cie wiÄ™kszych karabinÃ³w i miotaczy do walki na krÃ³tki, Å›redni i dÅ‚ugi dystans.

ArsenaÅ‚ caÅ‚kiem pokaÅºny, ale wielkoÅ›Ä‡ usprawiedliwiona, jeÅ¼eli spojrzeÄ‡ na to, z kim przyjdzie nam walczyÄ‡. JakimÅ› cudem udaÅ‚o siÄ™ twÃ³rcom przygotowaÄ‡ jeszcze wiÄ™ksze starcia niÅ¼ w pierwszej czÄ™Å›ci, a dziÄ™ki umiejÄ™tnoÅ›ciom Titusa rzucajÄ…c siÄ™ nawet na kilkudziesiÄ™ciu wrogÃ³w na raz nie bÄ™dziecie czuÄ‡ siÄ™ bezbronni. Miks walki w zwarciu i wykorzystania broni bocznej nie tylko zapewni ciÄ…gÅ‚Ä… presjÄ™ na przeciwnikach, ale w newralgicznych momentach egzekucje na wrogach odnowiÄ… Å¼ycie i pancerz naszego bohatera. Walka to prawdziwa wizyta w rzeÅºni - krew bucha na wszystkie strony, odciÄ™te koÅ„czyny i rozerwane ciaÅ‚a Å›cielÄ… siÄ™ gÄ™sto pod stopami potÄ™Å¼nego pancerza wspomaganego naszego bohatera.

Sam zapamiÄ™taÅ‚em pierwszÄ… czÄ™Å›Ä‡ gry jako doÅ›Ä‡ monotonne przebijanie siÄ™ przez kolejne fale przeciwnikÃ³w. DwÃ³jeczka jest moim zdaniem zdecydowanie bardziej dynamiczna, a wiÄ™ksza liczba zdolnoÅ›ci bohatera w walce wrÄ™cz, broni oraz zrÃ³Å¼nicowania misji sprawia, Å¼e czujemy siÄ™ caÅ‚y czas zaangaÅ¼owani w to, co widzimy na ekranie.


Na uwagÄ™ zasÅ‚uguje zarÃ³wno oprawa graficzna, jak i dÅºwiÄ™kowa - moim zdaniem naprawdÄ™ jedna i druga robiÄ… duÅ¼e wraÅ¼enie.

UPDATE to positive after patch 3.1:
By the Emperor, they did it! They fixed the game! The crashes stopped and they fixed the Linux/Steam Deck compatibility issue! We just got through two more story missions together tonight (10/11/24) and it was a BLAST! Thank you devs so much for creating this amazing game! Hopefully it doesn't get broken with another patch again. If it does, at least now I can trust it will be fixed.
The game is very fun and has just so much cool set design; really nails the whole 40K aesthetic. And I love running into stuff or hearing someone talk about something in the lore and then being able to explain it to my Warhammer-novitiate cousins and they go ""Ohhhh that's so coool!"" In tonight's session, the older one noticed a servitor plugged into the wall as he was walking past and he was like ""Woah guys guys come look at this! Its the most messed up thing so far; he's like plugged into the wall!"" And then I got to explain how the guy was probably a criminal, but maybe a failed astartes aspirant depending on the chapter... or just someone that someone else didn't like haha. We are having a great time and it is really getting them into the universe in a great way. Again, thank you for fixing it under the guidance of the Omnissiah. Praise be to the Emperor!

Original negative review after patch 3.0:
I love this game soooo much man, it hurts me to leave a negative review. This 3.0 patch really messed it up for me and my cousins though. It crashes like every 5 minutes now. And one of them was playing on a Steam Deck and now it doesn't even let Linux users login for online play any more? It worked before the patch just fine and we had already played through the first 2 story missions and the first Operations mission. Just wasted 3 hours TRYING to play through more of the story. First had to install it on a spare computer so the Steam Deck user could play. Now every time we go into a mission it works for about 5 minutes then crashes. Whole game freezes, white screen, windows does the whole ""This program isn't responding"" thing. Just so disappointed right now. Will change this if they fix it and I desperately hope they do, otherwise we wasted about $175.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nach etwa 40h Spielzeit muss ich sagen das das Game fÃ¼r mich eines der besten Spiele seit Ewigkeiten ist, ich kann weder die Kritik an der Performence des Spiels noch die Bugs bestÃ¤tigen, da ich von beidem genannten keinerlei Probleme hatte. Nach ungefÃ¤hr 30h Spielzeit im PVP kann ich auch nicht mit Vereinzelten Balancing VorwÃ¼rfen mitziehen, jede Klasse hat seine Vor und Nachteile und machen alle einfach nur extrem viel SpaÃŸ. Einen Negativ Punkt habe ich allerdings: Im PVP Modus gibt es leider nur fÃ¼r die Adeptus verschiedenen rÃ¼stungs varianten und bei den Heretic leider nur farbliche Anpassungen, hoffe aber das da noch Nachgeliefert wird. Ansonsten ist es wie schon gesagt ein extrem geiles Spiel was ich jedem nur Empfehlen kann.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First hour of the game is watching the same freezing cinematic, glad it released for me to get this enjoyable unforgettable experience. :) I'm sure it's a great game to the people able to play it, but apparently this is a ongoing issue with a lot of people. Lucky us. Can't recommend for a sixty dollar price tag, unless you wait for some patches when you can't even get out of the opening without troubleshooting.

Edit after 15 hours played.

The sluggishness in the cinematic cutscenes can really dampen the intended effect of awe at the things you get to see in this game up close from the amazing 40k universe. The game is worth it.. but maybe wait a while for them to fix some of their bugs, since their mentality seems to be they believe it's ""rare"" to encounter these issues. Both me and hubby ran this and had the same exact issues on completely different machines, and when you see you've experienced every issue on their bug list that has ""rare"" listed for the bug occurances as much as there are bugs in the game.. well.

For anyone having the same issue I and hubby had with the game where it wouldn't load the first opening cutscene, among others. Try disabling any overlays you have including steam overlay. Game doesn't really seem to like it much. Good luck fellow Astartes, The Emperor protects.

Many more hours in and I learn the game has finally gotten its private lobby systems.. along with a whole new host of bugs. Love the game, but its got some issues. The matchmaking systems and servers are an absolute mess. I tried to log in with the hubby to play today and can't even get it to stop disconnecting me. We couldn't log in at all yesterday either of us. It's a shame, cause the peeps that play this tend to be really cool an chill to hang out with while squashing the emperor's enemies.. but in order to really enjoy the experience the best option if your on pc, can't speak for console is to turn cross play off. Seems they didn't work out all the kinks for it before pushing it live.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L'ultime jeux Warhammer 40k!

Apres plus de 10 ans, voici enfin la suite des aventures de Titus, mais cela valait vraiment l'attente, Quel Jeux!!!
Un game play similaire, mais en mÃªme temps, tellement diffÃ©rent du 1er opus, nerveux, impactant et captivant.
Les concepteurs ont vÃ©ritablement su retranscrire toute l'atmosphÃ¨re du 42eme millÃ©naire.
Le jeux fourmille de dÃ©tails qui ravirons les vÃ©ritables Fan de l'univers GW.
La campagne est magnifique, il y a des scÃ¨nes tellement mythiques qu'a certains moment je poussais des vivats, emportÃ© dans ces moments si particuliers.
Le mode opÃ©rations est vraiment un ajout intÃ©ressant au niveau du scÃ©nario car il est liÃ© a certains passages de la campagne.
Le multi est assez simple, dommage que l'Ã©quilibre entre les classes ne soit pas au top, mais les MAJ devraient rÃ¨gler ce problÃ¨me.
Attention Ã  la difficultÃ©, elle est assez Ã©levÃ©e et c'est un jeux assez exigeant quand Ã  la maÃ®trise de ses actions, les ennemis sont lÃ©gions et retors, ils vous tendrons des embuscades et vous serez trÃ¨s souvent encerclÃ© de toute part sans possibilitÃ© de replis ; Nous sommes clairement dans une catÃ©gorie Hardcore gamers...donc si vous Ã¨tes plÃ»tot ""Casual"" passez votre chemin ou jamais vous ne pourrez profiter de ce jeux intÃ©gralement.

Courage and Honour, Brothers! I played the 1st Space Marine game a lot on the PS3 back in the day and I enjoyed it very much so I was very excited to play Space Marine 2. And now Titus is back! The story mode is a continuation of the 1st game, really fun with great moments a fine story and good gameplay. You also have coop (story/separate mode) and pvp. The customization is around Primaris marines so sadly you don't have older truly classic helmets etc. I hope that maybe later some will make it into the game.

So far I played this game in advanced access and I had some crash and connection issues but hopefully, with GPU drivers and patches the issues will be gone at release or soon after. I would recommend the game if you are a 40K fan or you like games in this genre and or if you liked the 1st game. Simply It's just a very good 3rd person action game set in the 40K universe. So Brothers, Let's attack without warning, mercy, or hesitation. Let the enemies of Mankind know that we will purge every last one of them, and let them shake in fear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's hard to say whether or not I want to recommend this game or not, on one hand I have immensely enjoyed the beautiful visuals, well crafted atmosphere, funny Easter eggs, but on the other hand the campaign was relatively bare bones and nothing to write home about, with supporting characters being easily forgettable, and repetitive game play that is limited by the nature of subject matter. Bolt weapons feel wimpy, with most basic enemies beyond humans taking more shots than is fun, and you as a space marine feeling rather wimpy as well.

The multiplayer aspect is fun, but pretty much every single mission is identical to the last, on maps that look identical 90% of the time. For the price point I wouldn't say its worth it. Maybe when its $30-40 id say 100% go for it, or after a few more major content drops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ma critique ne s'oriente que sur la campagne (Mode VÃ©tÃ©ran) et les missions coop, je n'ai pas jouÃ© en mode PVP donc je ne ferai aucune remarque sur Ã§a. Et je ne vais pas parler du cosmÃ©tique parce que c'est ...du cosmÃ©tique et chacun ses goÃ»ts.

PROS:
1. Le jeu est trÃ¨s beau, le style Grim Dark liÃ© Ã  Warhammer 40k est bien reprÃ©sentÃ©. Le Lore est sympathique et le Environmental Design est trÃ¨s rÃ©ussi mais...
2. Pas de bug...c'est important de le noter.
3. Un gameplay nerveux et rÃ©actif mais...
4. Un aspect gore trÃ¨s jouissif mais...
5. La reprÃ©sentation du poids de l'armure Space Marine est bien cool et le cotÃ© percutant des armes sur les petits mobs est trÃ¨s jouissif mais...
6. L'aspect massacre trÃ¨s jouissif de massacre Ã  la tronÃ§onneuse mais...
7. Des super moments Ã©piques...

CONTRE:
1. Un Level Design paresseux. Les missions et la campagne ont toujours le mÃªme schÃ©ma (couloir â†?arÃ¨ne â†?couloir â†?arÃ¨ne...).
2. Des temps de chargements parfois long mais acceptable.
3. Un verrouillage de camÃ©ra perfectible.
4. ...Qui s'estompe aprÃ¨s une centaine de fois. De plus, en mode VÃ©tÃ©ran, il est quasi nÃ©cessaire, de faire des exÃ©cutions pour Ã©viter les dÃ©gÃ¢ts. Car il y a peu de couverts et les soins sont quasi inexistant (en mode VÃ©tÃ©ran) hormis la capacitÃ© spÃ©ciale qui n'est pas souvent disponible). C'est peut-Ãªtre beaucoup plus facile...en facile...
5....A difficultÃ© Ã©levÃ©e, les armes sont des pistolets Ã  bouchons sur des ennemis autre que les petits mobs. De plus, peu importe l'arme Ã  feu choisie, vous ne voyez quasiment aucune diffÃ©rence.
6....c'est pas mal obligatoire de jouer au contact.
7. ...HÃ©las trop peu nombreux et pas reprÃ©sentatif du jeu.

Le jeu est trÃ¨s sympa avec des moments Ã©piques mais... . Le jeu ressemble Ã  un Gears of War avec le skin ""Warhammer 40k"" mais sans l'aspect Cover-Shooter. Le Gameplay est basique mais rÃ©actif.

Pour le 1/3 du prix et malgrÃ© ses dÃ©fauts et moins de Lore, un HellDiver 2 est bien plus jouissif.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patch 4.0's atrocious additions have been for the most part been reverted with Patch 4.1. The addition of a PTB was an excellent decision on Saber's part.

Space Marine 2 is back to being a fun game (for now).

I really, really want to like this game. But I don't.

It does a lot right, the world and characters are lore exact, it's a buy once get everything model in a world of battle passes and microtransactions and that's commendable.. It's just that it's all half-arsed.

The ultrawide implementation is.....crap. The bots that assist in operations and the campaign are brain dead. The developers give you the options to play as you choose but hamstring everything other than a narrow spectrum of those options so in reality it's the illusion of choice.

I hope Space Marine 3 resolves these, I wouldn't be buying it day 1 like I did this however. It's about the biggest disappointment of the year for me so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am amending this review from Negative to Positive. Patch 3.0 addressed many grievances I had with the Chaos faction, as well as how armor is handled. While I still feel the bolters in particular are unsatisfying to use in general, and I think ranged weapon TTKs could stand to be sped up for the sake of gamefeel (with enemy spawns being boosted to compensate), the game is now in a good enough state that I feel I can recommend it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Campaign was good, graphics good, story good, operations good, pvp good. But I have one major issue with the game's progression of difficulty. Its feigned, or poorly executed.

TL;DR: Game felt good at first, but as you progress in difficulty, it loses it's shine.. The game's enemies don't increase in number, rather they increase in health as you go up in difficulty, so the enemies are spongier, not harder. This paired with the mechanics of survival on higher difficulty ruined the game for me.

Full explanation:

Instead of throwing more enemies at you, or more variety, they just make the enemies spongier, (give them more health and resistance to stagger.) Same enemy, same moves. Just now it takes 2-3 mags of ammo, instead of 1. Guns feel under powered/useless at higher difficulties.

On the 1st or the 2nd difficulty, you feel like an Astartes, you feel powerful. You charge into combat, your teammates don't need constant supervision. Your weapons feel powerful. Knock it up to 3 difficulty, everything still feels good, weapons are okay, but melee seems more effective.

You hit difficulty 4, all of a sudden your guns feel pretty weak, even gold tier, max perked weapons. Dumping full mags into enemies skulls, and having to reload before they give an execute window. Enemy attacks can nearly wipe your health bar, with one hit. (Speaking about Majoris/Extremis here, the small enemies are never really a huge issue, even on max diffy). Juggling armor charges becomes a chore.

Playing on 5's isn't even playing the same game. No longer do you feel like an Astartes charging into combat, now you're literally just running around scrounging for life stem's and looking for the ever scarce ammo,(which is now even more limited with caps on uses), for a gun that feels useless. All of this while probably roll spamming to wait for your teammates re-spawn timer. This was 9/10 of my 5's, just running for your life, while praying your teammates are doing the same and not dying.

Final Take:

Game was a blast for 40 hours, but if I gotta play like a b!$%# to play on the higher difficulty, that's not fun. Ill still play a 3-4 with friends, but it feels like a chore as I know this game is gonna end up in the uninstalled folder after month or two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- It is to be death!
What is it to be death?
- It is to be the destroyer, the end of all things.
What is it to end life?
- It is an honour, to be the executioners of the Emperor.
Why do we fight?
- To protect the Imperium and deliver mankind from the evil of the xenos, the mutant and the heretic!
What is the xenos?
- A blight to be purged!
What is the mutant?
- A cancer to be excised!
What is the heretic?
- A shame to be expunged!
What is the bolter, the flamer, the missile?
- The incarnation of destruction, by which we bring about the death of the Emperor's foes!
What is the armour, the helm and the shield?
- The embodiment of our faith, our determination given form.
Who is the primarch?
- Our father, our guide, our king!
Who is the Chapter Master?
- The primarch's regent, to whom we swore oaths, the voice of the Emperor in the mortal world.
What are our oaths?
- The steel that binds our lives to the Emperor.
What did we swear?
- Our lives are as nought in the vision of the Emperor, save that by them we shall destroy all foes.
What is the fate of all foes?
- To perish in the fire of battle and be cleansed from the galaxy.
Who will prevail against the darkness?
- The Ultramarines!
Who are the swords of the Emperor?
- The Ultramarines!
Who are the sons of Magragge?
- The Ultramarines!

Edit-1 : A very well-thought update was released after the original problem patch, with nice changes that met players in the middle. The special education crowd that thinks the game was good because it was hard and unfun are crying, and that 0.1% of players are the main audience of the title. The hardest challenges and difficulties are still very very tough, and require good teamwork, dont worry.

Helldivers 2.0 baby. These companies do zero market research I guess because they want to ruin their reputation and make brain dead changes that even a junior arm chair dev can realize are bad changes. FFS, playing solo or with PUGs is hard enough.. Make all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fun first before you nerf the thing people use because its OP. Fencing is bad now, and block is still bad, and now the melta is bad with everything else. Helldivers made everything unfun to use and the game was a thread away from obscurity.

To put it simple: This Game is beyond amazing.
To get into more detail, you have:

- a game made for 40k fans with respect and love for the community
- the continuation of an old story aswell as an entirely new one, packaged together in the best way possible
- a graphical and performence peek even on minimum requirements
- a fun experience both pvp and pve with 6 unique classes to play as
- gameplay that is easy to learn but hard to master, with 4 difficulties to choose from for both pve and the campaign (aswell as a 5. on the horizon)
- a grind to sink your teeth in for cosmetics aswell as endgame perks and weapon upgrades that keeps you busy for hours
- no microtransactions whatsoever
- Free gameplay contant up and coming till mid 2025
- a completely optional season pass only including cosmetics and drip

and not to forget,

- living the dream of beeing one of the emperors chosen, a powerfull angle of death figthing against the horrors of the galaxy

Gonna be completely honest, after the first 30 minutes of optimization hell, I am safe to say that the early trials were worth it. A story that sticks to the core of 40k, the beautiful, immersive set pieces. This is THE 40k game I've been waiting for. The combat system has taken some time to get used to, but there's nothing more satisfying than pulling off a chain of executions and heavy hitting slams into the horde that surrounds you (before you turn the entire place into a red mist). And it's not just the melee. The ranged weapons have the most satisfying bolter punches I've seen in a 40k game yet.

The multiplayer PVP mode could use some balancing, and the campaign AI really needs a tweak or two, but this is something that nobody is a stranger to at this point. It's an expected headache when you make gameplay surrounding co-op and then give us robots with the brains of a sloth to back us up.

I accidentally purchased the early access pre-order, but as far as I'm concerned, it's been worth every penny, and will be for a long time to come. Especially with the solid replay value. I may have distrust in GW, but nonetheless I am very content with Space Marine 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Release version - Worked well, fun game with friends.

Newest Patch - Nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf..... Still a huge NO from me, friends have already moved on, many issue still around. Should of been boosting useless skills and weapons and not nerfing good things. Gawd help solo players.

Older patch - Infinite black screen on mission launch. Talk about cocking up their game.

Co-Op missions (affecting my friends and I), Launch mission, Load into black screen, stumble around in the dark to find the launch area again, if we get lucky mission might start. But then loads incorrect mission to what we chose. Very poor Quality Assurance on Sabers behalf to release such a poorly done patch.

Currently the Dev's have no clue on which way to go with this game, tweaking balance to the complainers about how hard it is (its not hard) and now this patch makes the game unplayable for quite a few.

We'll see if the Dev's can fix this asap, and I might thumbs up this review. But as it stands, releasing a patch not ready for release was a very bad move.

I don't hold our for much to change, its radio silence from the Dev's on Steam, which is a shame really. Wont be buying another product with this type of support from Saber unless they can start being active and actually fix the issues that matter, and worry about dumbing down the game later on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An excellent game with some performance issues on lower-end pc's (I'm still rocking a 1080Ti because GPUs are stupid expensive still).

Pros:
- This game *nails* the 40k aesthetic and environment better than any game before it - even Darktide.
- 3 game modes on launch. Even if Eternal War has some server issues, having more options on launch is good. Operations will get fleshed out further based on roadmap being posted by devs, so there'll be even more content to dig through later.
- Combat feels pretty good! The default control scheme on mouse and keyboard is a little whack, but you get used to it (or you can change it). Only thing is you *will* get animation trapped sometimes. It just happens.
- Visceral executions are a delight to watch

Cons:
- Story is fine I guess, any complaints I have are spoilers.
- Enemy variety is a little low.
- The AI for your two squadmates in solo-Campaign are *not* okay. They suck ass. Will frequently not target enemies, not execute stunned enemies, will not target enemies attacking objectives, sometimes won't even res you if you go down. Play with friends, or play on Easy (game doesn't have achievements for beating campaign on set difficulties, just for beating campaign at all) because playing on the hardest difficulty without friends has a few very acute pain points in the story. Otherwise, game isn't actually that hard.
- Eternal War (PvP) mode is total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™? Time to kill is way too short, and there seems to be no rails on who you can get match-making into. So if you're a new guy into the PvP mode, you can get matched with people with all - and I mean *all* - the unlocked gear and get totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on until you catch up. Which can take a while, given you're getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on. This mode needs a rework, ASAP.
- The pay to get early access was scummy. Wish companies would stop this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.
- Performance issues; I've got an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 16GB of RAM, and a 1080Ti. Game runs well enough but has some serious hangups once in a while even on Low settings. Possibly just lag from people joining/leaving sessions, but it's hard to tell if it's my hardware or the network. I'm overdue for an upgrade, so this might be an entirely *me* problem.
- Solo queueing into Operations is a similar annoyance in lack of team cohesion that solo-ing into LFD2 or *any* co-op PvE will bring you. People will run ahead, ignoring enemies, letting teammates die, just to try and run the level as fast as possible. Annoying as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, as it always is.

This is the only game where you can be disconnected from your own lobby, only this game can you be disconnected from your own SINGLEPLAYER CAMPAIGN, only this game in 2024 can you never find a lobby that is full over the course of 4-5 hours at a time.
Kicked from my own lobby while mid mission, oddly enough my buddy did not get booted, these devs need to fix the matchmaking and netcode! 
A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
By: Hawk


The loading.. dear god the loading screens are everywhere... whenever you move to another segment of the ship, loading screen, load a save loading screen, load back into your own ship from coop to campaign.. loading screen, loading back to the main menu... loading when just trying to switch lobbies, loading screen. Loading screens for every single aspect of this game and the loading takes way too long even on the recommended SSD. I can not imagine how slow this loads on a standard spin drive... it's sad honestly how poorly optimized in that department this game is.

The balance in this game is horrendous, your super human space marines are like paper and our weapons shoot hugs and kisses while every single enemy in the entire game are guaranteed one shot kills on ALL difficulties. Even in the singleplayer campaign you can feel your lack of ability to stay alive and do damage but it's not as apparent until you start playing the pathetically small number of 6 whole coop operations missions. Then you see the game for what it really is, spongy enemies and weak paper thin player durability. At no point do you ever feel powerful, even maxed out Astartes Primaris Marines can only take 1 or 2 hits before they are dead while you get zero ability to regen health, unlike Space Marine 1, where upon doing a finisher you would regain health. In the squeal that was NOT made by the same developers by the way, you regain lost health IF you get to it in time, which is barely a second before you drop to the new health position. This makes the horrible gameplay balance all the more apparent when you start playing any sort of difficulty. Most of the actual combat is just you trying to parry 500000 enemies on screen or dodging constantly, it is incredibly boring and tedious. I think the devs watched too much Dark Souls or something because this is not even close to what Space Marine 1 was about. Want to actually stand and fight? Nope dodge roll everywhere, the game spawns far too many enemies that will oneshot you regularly even while you're spamming parry or dodge, it's broken.

Maxing out one class in the coop is great and all until you run into a lobby that has another person using your class so then you get to figure out which lower leveled class you can pick so that you can even play. Lower level classes are statically weaker and have less team aid, leveling your characters up is a chore and half of the perk tree on each is totally arbitrary ""5% better accuracy"" that kind of thing. Stuff that should be just a flat upgrade to your class in any other game like this, in SM2 it's a ""feature"" that you're nerfed all of the time. There is zero power fantasy, be it from your class or your weapons.

On the weapons front, 90% of ALL weapons are in the trash bin, clearly the devs never set foot in the game past easy, maybe, this game reeks of the same type of poor balancing that killed Helldivers 2, make the player weak, and strengthen the NPCs at all times. On the subject of weapons, the only way to ""upgrade"" from your starting weapon to Tiers 2-4 is to find servitor skulls that give you an upgrade token to be spent on a single weapon that you will then have to use several of in that tier then find another upgrade token in the next difficulty, repeat the process then find the last upgrade token for THAT weapon. If you are unable to do the other 2 higher difficulties you will be missing out on 2/3rds of your weapon upgrades, that's right you are all but walled off from progress or fun by a difficulty spike. By the way these are not guaranteed, you have to FIND these things, 1 per mission over the course of 40+ minutes per mission on average, again similar to Samples in HD2, which is not a good idea I might add. You can get a second one from beating a boss that can randomly spawn in some sections of the mission but you run the risk of failing the mission thus getting basically nothing for your time. The weapon upgrading system is bad, simply put, if you take your starting weapon and try to use it on Tier 4 difficulty you will do ZERO damage to every.single.enemy. Even after you upgrade all weapons save for 3, the Melta Rifle, the Las Fusil and the Multi Melta, those are the only 3 weapons that can even compete, the rest are so underpowered itâ€™s clear that the devs did not use anything other than those 3 during any testing that they may have done (which could not have been much given the state of the game).
The quintessential Space Marine weapons, the Bolter based weapons, are some of the worst in the entire game, bar none, they do no damage, have horrible rates of fire and hold almost no ammo.

Another issue with the balance is that the higher you go up in difficulty the game suddenly turns into WWZ, except youâ€™re weaker than survivors in a zombie game. You have to scrounge for ammo, med kits and any other supplies during the entire match. The ultra prepared Astartes have to scrounge for ammoâ€? Let that sink in please. This mechanic just adds to the additional frustration that you can have when trying to unwind after coming home from work, now you get to â€œworkâ€?again by grinding a single character with a single few weapons for hours only to make little to no progress even on Tier 4 difficulty. The limited number of ops missions is just 6, yes you heard me, only 6, 3 of which have a faction that are some of the least fun to fight against so barely anyone plays them so realistically you only have 3 missions that you will then have to farm ad-nauseam to get level up your characters, weapons and get cosmetics. It is such a pathetic offering that honestly makes me think that this is yet another Beta full priced release by a greedy developer and publisher. Oh they have a â€œplanâ€?with a roadmap next year they plan on adding 1 (ONE) additional coop mission, that is all they plan on adding, maybe a hoard mode next year but we donâ€™t know anything about it. This is a very hollow game honestly, if you get it just for the singleplayer fine but do not buy anything beyond that, it is simply not worth it for what they are charging versus what is offered.

The good is that besides your slow speed (which gets you killed far too often to count, everything is faster than you apparently even though in the lore it is stated that â€œnothing that big should move so quicklyâ€? you feel tanky, at least in your movement, the actual combat no you feel as if youâ€™re made out of single ply toilet paper. The sound effects and visual effects and graphics are great. Story is good for a Space Marine game, characters are good, build up throughout the whole game is good.

Oh and as a side note, Saber Interactive makes sure to hide this but upon installing the game, youâ€™re also forced to install the Epic Game Store. Why?! Well according to the developers, it's their way of doing crossplay, why you ask? Well they sure donâ€™t share with us the details, itâ€™s strange how many other games have connect to both Epic and Steam versions just fine without forcing you to install EGS. Something to keep in mind, if you do not want that spyware on your PC then do not buy this, you NEED to have it installed in order to play with anyone, period. The devs made sure that you suffered if you dared to prefer your own systemâ€™s integrity and privacy.

Maybe once Saber Interactive gets their stuff together and balances the game and adds more content that should have been in when SM2 was released then maybe things will change. Right now though itâ€™s nothing but frustration by the gameplay and the horrible netcode and match making system that Saber clearly did not test thoroughly enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Edit: I'm switching some categories around and migrating my overall reason for not recommending the game to lean more towards the incredibly unstable matchmaking system.

Pros
-Intense and dynamic combat
-Great graphics
-Interesting story so far
-Multiplayer is fun and addicting (have not tried PvP yet)
-There's a nice blend of needing to use all weapons at your disposal

Cons
-Friendly bot AI is not the best. They seem to be randomly aggressive and passive at weird intervals.
-The matchmaking system is quite unstable, leading to excessive load screens. I don't actually believe this is a server performance issue, I think it's how the matchmaking system is currently designed. *If a player queues for quick match and...: 1. gets a mission they don't like and leaves the squad. 2. does not want to be a party leader and leaves the squad / quits to title screen. ...this seems to have a direct impact on the players who get pulled into the queue of this player that did not stick around. I believe (not a confirmed fact) this is why we see a lot of ""joining server"" load screens that take a long time. I want to say the game is not optimized for dealing with these scenarios.

Pro/Con
-Ammo economy can be rough in some points of missions and can make progression more difficult than expected. Learning to search crates for ammo and being wise with ammo consumption helps with this.
-There is a strong focus on needing to use the parry system. Some people may hate that, others may not. Once you get the hang of it though, your gameplay improves quite a bit.
-Incoming damage is a bit rough, especially melee attacks, but this does condition you to block, parry, and improve movement more.
-There is an intense amount of grinding needed to achieve progression in multiplayer. Some may see this as a good thing to stay motivated to play, others may think it's too much of a grind fest and not enjoy it.
-Restricting multiplayer play to one class per player. This creates diversity however is an immediate generation of frustration for players who can't consistently play the class they wish to play.

Overall, I am enjoying the game. However, I would like to see some improvements before I feel I can confidently recommend the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6 hours in, it is very pretty. Campaign has enough blood and gore to satisfy that blood lust. Enjoying what the game has to offer. CO-OP can be hit and miss, and needs work, have not checked out the PvE or PvP as yet.

Though a few quirks, KBM setup is really weird and not really user friendly in some situations. Controller is just as bad

It is 2024, no support for Ultrawide screen? It looks like I am gaming 16:10 23inch LCD Monitor from the year 2000. Instead of having this little boxy window type setup, using a full screen would make this game more immersive.

Final rating with what I have played 8/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Campaign is rather short but just brutal to the core .
Gameplay is standard with gunplay being pretty good ( i just love bolter sounds lol )
MP part is where real fun is , love to see multiple classes complementing each other even though i just jump and slam with my hammer anything that moves .
Loving how deatailed is chapter customization with so many chapters to choose from though its just cosmetics only .
Not once encountered a single bug nor glitch ( bravo for that )
Only real issue is mp part seems rather unstable atm ( either i get time outs or never ending loading screens )
If you are a warhammer fan like me you would buy and love it , but other non warhammer fans better wait for sale ( its way too pricey for the amount of content though roadmap looks promising )
For the rest of warhammer fans out there '' He who stands with me , shall be my brother'' !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WTF...did Focus recently hire Alexus from Arrowhead? For a major patch before a new content drop they think it's wise to just drop a bunch of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?nerfs. I swear developers these days have no idea how to manage an ip without pissing off their customers and snatching defeat from the hands of victory.

Sure developers can pull quantitative data on everything that players do in a game; however, this does not provide any insight into the qualitative reasons why players make the choices that they do. Here's a pro marketing tip for you Focus: players enjoy feeling overpowered, and nerfs are the opposite of fun. If you think there is no other choice but to nerf something, then you might want to wrap it in a 'buff sandwich' so players don't resent you.

Hopefully they can pull their collective heads from their asses before the majority of players lose faith and give up like we did with helldivers 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Honestly, the game isn't fun.

I don't find the game mechanics enjoyable or fun- I understand what you're supposed to do, but the game makes it frustrating to actually play and enjoy. The game is more stressful than it is fun, and I just don't get anything out it.

I shouldn't have bought this, nor should I have paid for the DLC. I wish that I was still in the window to get a refund, since honestly, it's just... meh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The Codex Astartes is a set of rules. They guide us, shape us as ultramarines, teach us to hold duty and honor sacred above all. But how we live with those rules is true test of a Space Marine."" - Captain Titus

A great sequel from Space Marine (2011), so many improvement on combat that make things more satisfying and most of time you find yourself surrounded with full of horde and make you thinking you wouldn't made it but you made it anyway. The main story is pretty simple just like the previous one honestly, but rather than just rush straight toward objective and with very clunky map design, at least in Space Marine 2 there is some improvement with world design that you can walk arround first and feel the atmosphere of Warhammer 40K universe. And let me tell you, the details on world design in this game is very impressive, I can just give this game 10/10 just for the world design it self. It's really have warhammer vibes, from the beginning toward the end, you can just randomly take a screenshot and it can be your new wallpaper.







+The world design is very impresive, you can tell the designer really appreciate the Warhammer 40K universe.
+So much improvement combat form Space Marine (2011) melee combat is much more satisfying now, and oh dont forget about melta gun, that gun is shredded everything.
+Your own companion brothers have their own motive and have some narative at least. it make your squad more alive and meaningful.
+They have PVP and PVE after your finish your campaign or when still in campaign. its really rare to see video games these day to have both PVP and PVE content.
+ Is not a live service game, but apparently the developers still have some plans for future updates.


- For the game that come from universe that have so much lore apparently the lore in this game is very little and simple. Just like Space marine 1 there is no much lore in the world that you have played, you see.. they have Dataslate sort of like BioShock audio diaries. But Dataslate in this game is really boring and not much added to main story or not make it the world more interesting. And to make it worse these Dataslate are very hidden. Im type of player who seeking the lore and check every corner of the map and yet im still missing some of dataslate. atleast in Bioshock you can see these diaries everywhere and so much interesting and have their own additional strories that make the world much alive.
- (PVP) Im playing pvp just Day 2 after release, and oh sweet terra have a mercy.... so many cheater with infinite grenade in pvp. the game itself have their own anticheat but it doesnt work i guess.

The continues story after the original Space Marine. Captain Titus had been imprisoned and tortured for a century, but eventually he was freed and allowed to return but no longer as a captain. The main story is quite short, simple and yet still interesting at least for me, especially if you Warhammer fans or have played Space Marine before. The main campaign is around 6-8 hours but im very much enjoyed it every minutes of it, im rather have 8 hours of full enjoyment rather than 20 hours of nothingness. Unlike the original Space Marine, when the story it just about Captain Titus at least in Space Marine 2 the stories is arround him and his chapters.



For the main campaign and the PVE i'd say is really good and satisfying. It really improve from everything you hoped for in the original Space Marine. The horde of tyranids swarmp you and you have really overpowered gun that can blast them and melt them. The bolt and plasma gun now is not useless anymore and can be good in battle. The melee attack like chainsaw and of course the warhammer (hehe) have satisfying animation when you used them. Many animation like dash is not clunky anymore. and if you are good at the game you can parry the attack of the enemies rather than dodge them.

Sadly the gameplay for pvp isnt for me. And dont get me wrong, the pvp is pretty good but even though if you are in top frag and can kill many enemies, still there is something is missing, it just like when you killed the enemies but it just feel empty. I dont know what is called but i just hoping pvp is more intense and have satisfying combat effect. i just hope is more like Tintanfall 2 multiplayer kinda thing when there is a bot (like guardsmen) to make it more interesting and alive.

I think the soundtrack are good but is not really memorable tbh. I dont quite remember which the soundtrack in Space Marine 2 that have special in my heart like 'The Only Thing They Fear Is You' from DOOM or 'Rory O'More / Saddle The Pony' from Bioshock Infinite, i guess none from Space Marine 2. But hey at least the sounds really capture in every scene and get the job done especially at the end.

Space Marine 2 has much improve from the original and the attention to the Warhammer 40K worlds and it details is really impresive. The combat it much satisfying and not feel clunky anymore. Is it worth it? well for the gold/ultra edition still debated since there is no much content for it prices, but for Standard Edition its very worth it especially if you are Warhammer 40k fans. Like people have said it before, 40K fans are super protective of the ip and demolish stuff they donâ€™t like so the positive reception to the game says volumes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game feels like its from a bygone age, one where Microsoft and Xbox were putting up a fight (and maybe even winning) against Sony in the Console Wars. Its great.

An entertaining linear story mode at around 5-6 hours (on Normal mode), though for maximum enjoyment you should have played or at least seen a recap of Space Marine 1. (And/or understanding Warhammer 40K lore)

A 3 man Co-op ""Operations"" mode that sees you play as your own different Marines that you can customize head to toe (from 6 different classes) and go on missions with other aspiring recruits/players trying to level up and score better gear.

Though at the moment there are only 6 missions to complete. They mostly feel good to play through, and multiple runs are needed to upgrade and level up your Space Marine.

(This is also the live-service, seasonal part of the game so expect content updates unless something completely unexpected happens).

There is also a very fun but very dry no nonsense PVP akin to old COD lobbies but without the vulgarities, racism, and probably no no-scopes (yet).

Hope the devs update this ""Eternal War"" mode as well cause there is some good building blocks to work with.

Combat is very fun, consisting of dodges and parries to outmaneuver and counterattack the enemy respectively.

Not too much to learn other than the timings of parries/dodges and melee combos of each weapon but the chaotic horde-style gameplay will still sometimes give you problems even if you have mastered the intricate art of murdering other Alien lifeforms.

8.5/10 or 9/10 if you are already a fan of 40K.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Story and campaign are best-of-40k. The tech to invite up to two friends replacing your NPC squad members anytime to play the story in coop is one of the best features around. I wish more games would support this!

After enjoying the story I thought the game was over. But then I startet the PvE-Content, called ""Operations"". â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, I wish I did not. Challenging, motivating, unlock cosmetics and heralics, lots of complexity in skills, weapons, classes and game mechanics. Rotating and random events in very mission run, and even more. And the need to get better because you WANT to successful finish the operations in ""ruthless"" to grab the best weapon upgrades around.

Finishing the story was 16 hours of top entertainment.

Starting up the endgame-PvE-Content was another 75 hours and not even one boring second so far. Two classes mastered, four to go - and there's still the ""deadly""-level to do. For more special cosmetics!

This game is 40k as it should be. THANK YOU, Saber Interactive! THANK YOU! I will buy every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?DLC you are going to offer, just because you deserve it. Games like this prove that gaming is more than marketing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few hours in and can't remember the last time I had this much fun with a game. I'm new to the Warhammer universe, except for having played a couple hours of Darktide and while some of the deeper lore is going over my head, I still find the story pretty easy to follow. Gameplay is super smooth and addicting to hit combos. Graphics are amazing and sheer panic I feel seeing a horde barreling towards me is a new but welcome feeling.

While still getting into the game and there's a lot more to get into, wanted to at least leave an early, positive review to help counteract the tinfoil hat reviewers leaving negative reviews due to the epic games launcher.

I would like to start by saying that, I don't like Warhammer or anything related to it, from the figurine painting, to the books, and the table-top game.

Anyway my partner showed me the trailer of space marine II which didn't seem too bad, and it's co-op so I decided to give it a try. Space marine II is surprisingly good. I never thought I would actually enjoy something related to Warhammer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anyway I don't know if it's related to my AMD card but the game keep crashing. In one session about an hour into the game it crashed 4 times. I've updated everything related to AMD and followed some tips from people having the same issue as me but nothing worked. I mean if that doesn't show how determined I am. I don't know what does. I know they are releasing a patch end of September so hopefully whatever it's creating the crash issue will be fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't know what the devs actually wanted to do, but with the 4.0 update they made some baffling decisions balancing wise. Had a blast before, as I was able to play Ruthless solo Operations. It wasn't always easy, but it had the right amount of challenge. With the new update they didn't make the game more challenging, only frustrating. It is not fun anymore.

EDIT: after playing for a while after Patch 4.1, I have to say the devs addressed the issues and fixed many of the problems that made the game frustrating. I'm having fun again and can't wait to play more. Zoanthropes are still annoying though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FÃ¼r mich als Warhammer 40k BÃ¼cher Nerd (ca. 200 StÃ¼ck), ist es ein absoluter Traum bisher. Habe den VorgÃ¤nger schon geliebt und fÃ¼hle mich hier auch gleich zuhause.

Kampfsystem macht SpaÃŸ und Timing bestimmt vieles.
Auf Normal ist es ein angenehmes Spielerlebnis, im Regelfall weiÃŸ man warum man den Apothecarius braucht.


MIr gefÃ¤llt vor allem der Detailgrad der Models und Umgebung, stand nun schon mehrfach raum und habe die Schlachtszenen und das Ambiente genossen. Wenn ein Sschwarm aus Hormaganten angerannt kommt und sich Ã¼bereinander stapelt um an dich heran zu kommen. Einfach herrlich. Sie danach fachgerecht mit Fragmentgranaten zu erledigen umnso mehr.

Spiel lÃ¤uft bisher Bugfrei und sehr Stabil ( i9-9900KF + Geforce 2080 Super + 16BG Ram)

Update
Kampagne feritg und es ist zum Ende hin schade das sie in meinen Augen noch Potenzial verschenkt haben (3. Volk). Man benutzt schlieÃŸlich deren Tech am Ende und aktiviert sie.
Warum die Tyraniden ende MidGame als Gegner verschwinden erschlieÃŸt sich mir ebenfalls nicht. Sie haben schlieÃŸlich ne Invasion gestartet. Der Schwarmverstand interessiert nur das er neue Materie bekommt, von wem oder was is dem egal.

So genug gemeckert.

Ich hab mich die komplette Kampagne unterhalten gefÃ¼hlt, bin regelmÃ¤ÃŸig stehen geblieben und hab die AtmosphÃ¤re genossen, hatte keine Bugs und oder AbstÃ¼rze.

Game was great until patch 4.0. The game definitely needed a bump on difficulty since it was too easy but making me play hugging my team mates all the time just killed the game to me. As a vanguard, you just killed my will to take any initiative. No more jumping to the ranged mobs that are destroying us from far away, no more flanking, just play within a small box and pray that you can see anything other done pixels on your screen when things get crowded...

The rest of changes and buffs to the mobs were welcome, finally a challenge but I can't play it when the game forces me to position myself within 5 to 7 meters of my team mates when I am the only melee in the party. On top of it, in 1hour of gameplay today, the armor mechanic failed several times not detecting team mates next to me.

The game is good but there is not enough content especially for 60 dollars
I would recommend waiting for some future updated before purchasing but according to the updates they have been putting out for development it appears this is too difficult for them and they plan to focus on making private matches witch should of been something off of release and maybe more operation missions they had 3 at launch woop wooop a total of 3 hours if you drag it out of game play the Champaign is short you can play the whole thing in a few hours.
Very pretty game but that is all it is it sadly doesn't look like it will ever have enough content that makes it worth 60 dollars I have bought games for 15 bucks with more replay ability and more actual design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game was everything I wanted it to be. It was fun, challenging, and rewarding. After grinding for quite some time, I feel like I can finally give this game a fair review. You should buy this game. However, the most recent changes the studio implemented are not good for the direction or the longevity of the game. These new updates completely destroy a cohesive gaming experience by artificially making the game harder if you arenâ€™t within 10 feet of your battle brothers. With so many dynamic ways to play this game, you cripple viable play styles and tactics by restricting how far away you can get from your teammates. The other changes that were implemented regarding ammo economy and parry windows are negligible in comparison. With the proximity armor recovery, your Snipers, Vanguards, and Assaults cannot be utilized effectively as their primary purpose is to single out and separate to focus on specific targets in the battlefield. This would be the only thing I hope is changed soon or I foresee a strong decrease in player engagement. A bolter buff would be rad too, but I digress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is now the new gold standard for 40k games. Like GD.
10/10 for any warhammer fan, the campaign alone is a love letter you can't write without the dev's being lore accurate fans.
8.5/10 otherwise. Wish bolter variants were more potent.

A Love Letter to Ferdowsi's Epics and Homer's Odyssey

Right from the start, you can sense you are in for one fantastic and epic journey. The combat, the atmosphere, the music, all signals for a game definitely not suitable for the feeble minded.

A true return to the old school gaming era, and a journey you cannot miss. A solid 9/10 ğŸ‘",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fantastic Warhammer game! The visuals are stunning, and the Warhammer aesthetics - especially in the fine details - are spot on. I'm not a fan of PvP here, but the story elements are excellent and really draw you in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you like warhammer this game will give you a big rubbery one.
If you dont you're looking at AT LEAST a chub.

Primeiro e antes de mais nada, talvez essa anÃ¡lise seja enviesada pelo simples fato de eu curtir o universo de W40K jÃ¡ tem bastante tempo, mas vamos lÃ¡ pras perguntas mais simples (o que normalmente a pessoa quer saber quando vem ler ssasporcaria):

O jogo Ã© bom? Sim.

O jogo tÃ¡ pesado? TÃ¡.

Vale a pena comprar? Se tu tÃ¡ com o dinheiro e nÃ£o vai gastar com coisas mais importantes, com certeza.

Tem bastante customizaÃ§Ã£o mesmo? Tem, sÃ³ que eu achei de certa forma limitada em relaÃ§Ã£o a algumas coisas (por exemplo querer pintar determinada parte da power armor mas nÃ£o poder por que ficou bem ""generalizada"" a colorizaÃ§Ã£o), alÃ©m, de Ã© claro, terem colocado basicamente todas as customizaÃ§Ãµes como ""comprÃ¡veis"" com pontos que vocÃª ganha quando joga missÃµes no modo de operations, outra coisa, um negÃ³cio que achei de certa forma ""paia"" foi o fato de que nÃ£o vai dar pra pintar as armaduras de campeÃ£o dos capÃ­tulos (no caso sÃ³ tem dos ultramarines atÃ© agora mas muito provavelmente vai valer pras que lanÃ§arem no futuro tambÃ©m).

Qual versÃ£o vale mais a pena pegar? Cara, depende de se tu curte a franquia ou nÃ£o, a season pass que Ã© dada na Gold serÃ¡ mais pra pegar novas customizaÃ§Ãµes do que qualquer outra coisa, se for pegar a ultra sÃ³ pegue se tu pensa que jogar com uma minigun (ou algum outro trabuco pesado) estilo o Heavy do TF2 Ã© legal/divertido (A classe tÃ¡ legal mas eu prefiro jogar full melee), EU recomendaria pegar a standard se caso tu nÃ£o for alguÃ©m que jÃ¡ curta o universo/temÃ¡tica de W40K.

DÃ¡ pra jogar solo ou Ã© obrigatÃ³rio ter amigo pra jogar junto? Bicho, dÃ¡ pra jogar solo, o bot Ã© meio burro mas ele ajuda. O jogo pra jogar com os amigos Ã© muito bom, e, se caso vocÃª quiser jogar o modo ""Operations"" que Ã© o modo PvE do jogo (fora a campanha), o matchmaking Ã© bem rÃ¡pido, sem contar tambÃ©m que tem o modo PvP que tem bastante gente jogando no momento.

Tem bastante variedade de arma? Mais ou menos. Atualmente existem as ""figurinhas carimbadas"" da franquia, algumas delas ficam meio que de escanteio por existirem armas mais fortes (meio que nÃ£o sÃ£o tÃ£o balanceadas), no futuro, pelo que falaram e pelo roadmap, serÃ£o adicionadas novas armas, entÃ£o, Ã© sÃ³ aguardar.

A campanha Ã© muito longa? Cara, pelo que eu vi, nÃ£o tanto, Ã© papo de 20 horas ao que parece (isso com vocÃª tomando seu tempo e jogando na calma), apesar disso, pelo que joguei, curti o rumo da histÃ³ria e a progressÃ£o. O que vai dar longevidade ao jogo Ã© mais o modo PvE e o PvP.


(SÃ³ um adendo, como falei, o jogo tÃ¡ bem pesado, alÃ©m disso, aparentemente tem alguns bugs como por exemplo inimigos invisÃ­veis e/ou o seu personagem tambÃ©m invisÃ­vel, pessoalmente nÃ£o presenciei nenhum bug atÃ© agora, jogo tÃ¡ rodando de boas (apesar que meu PC tÃ¡ uma porqueira pra rodar o jogo))

No mais Ã© isso.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J'ai de la difficultÃ© Ã  savoir oÃ¹ placer ce jeu... L'histoire est bonne et les graphismes supers, mais le jeu n'est rien d'autre qu'un dÃ©fouloir dans un monde ultra linÃ©aire... J'aurais aimÃ© avoir le choix entre les factions, voir les Primarques, conquÃ©rir des mondes et en annihiler d'autres...J'aurais aimÃ© avoir un jeu qui soit plus que juste une campagne de ligne droite et un mode pvp comme j'en ai vue 100000 d'autre..

Faite moi un Space Marin digne d'un baldur's gate 3 s'il vous plait!

Aucune attache envers les personnages, ou envers les planÃ¨tes qui me laissaient de marbres...

J'en demande probablement trop, ou Ã©tait-ce notre technologie, ou le temps qui limite les dÃ©veloppeurs, mais l'univers de Warhammer est GIGANTESQUE! Et la je trouve que tout son potentiel n'est explorÃ© qu'Ã  1%...

Alors oui, je recommande ce jeu, mais c'est loin d'Ãªtre un chef d'oeuvre et c'est avec un goÃ»t amer de dÃ©ception par rapport aux attentes que j'avais que je dÃ©sinstalle le jeu..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No private PvE lobbies at launch is incredibly dumb. Some people want to fight all the enemies, some want to speedrun trough levels, some want to explore every corner. All are legitimate ways to play the game, so forcing all these players to play with each other is very frustrating. I've experienced both wanting to take my time, only to have some impatient person run ahead, and I've at times been that impatient person waiting for someone to turn over every rock in a level.

Also the problem of other players having the same class is annoying. I've had multiple matches in a row where I've had to change class, even though I've hopped on specifically to level class.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Problems With the Progression System,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The current progression system in an otherwise great game is a turn-off and is going to drive would be players away from sticking with the game as it evolves over the course of its road map,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Separate Cosmetic and Class Progression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Having a single currency, Requisitions, be required to progress these categories puts players in a position where they are going to make mistakes as they try to kit out their preferred Astartes Chapter. Players will be in search of the correct right shoulder insignia or company pauldron trim paint and this means sacrificing progression of class skills. There is no explanation of this risk to a new player and the system itself is so frustrating its easy to have level 15 in a class and not be able to afford even the first row of its perks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The weapon system is convoluted and tying better weapons behind higher difficulty is a guaranteed way to drive players away out of frustration. The Minimal difficulty in this game is hard and recommending """"Level 5"""" to players to take on the next difficulty tier is meaningless if they have spent their Requisitions on cosmetics instead of their class skills.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This game is going to draw a lot of attention when it fully launches. People will be excited about playing as a Space Marine. Even with the above suggested changes the game is going to be a GRIND to progress. When players find out their progress is also heavily skill gated in what is a seriously difficult game they will move on to the next thing. Its important to preserve the high difficulty for players who have the skill and want that challenge. its equally important that the perks and equipment necessary to play on higher difficulties become available to players of lower skill and that the systems involved here be retooled quickly or this game will end up with a very small player base of nothing but hardcore difficulty seekers. The entire backbone of what is otherwise a great game, its progression systems, are a total miss and I hope you take the above as constructive criticism to improve the game and sustain your audience while you still have the opportunity to do so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dodge and parry mechanics are super clunky. Solo campaign missions on veteran are unbearable since you are getting focused by everything over bots.

Good game.

Space Marine 2 has a great potential and may become extremely popular co-op game. It's extremely fun to play this game in co-op. My wife also liked this game, I was really happy to play SM2 with her.

Story is good, combat feels amazing, world (level design) looks really cool and impressive, co-op is awesome (I was playing in team of 2 friends), boss fights are kinda challenging and enjoyable, graphics and performance is really good for my GeForce GTX 1070 video card, I have no problems at all. PvE aspect of this game is good, all 6 classes are more or less cool to play.

Waiting for some meaningful DLCs like new enemies (necrons, orks...) and biomes(lava world, ice world, ocean world (perhaps, it may be some giant ocean facility or something) for PvE and not just new skins.

P.S.: Would be cool to see Sisters of Battle/Adepta Sororitas as playable faction with separate campaign as DLC at some point (side story + co-op multiplayer stuff).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allright.

I am into warhammer for well over 20 years. I own basicly every 40k game there is from psp Squad Command to Chaos Gate for windows 95. I am an absolute Fanboi, there is no way to call it otherwise. I am a true nerd on that subject. Read the Books, watched the Films/Shows (Yes, the 80s VHS Movies and Warhammer+ Content). I own several Armies and collect the various army books since 2nd Edition.

With that out of the Way I can truly say, this game is a loveletter from the Developers to the Hardcore Fanbois. And I hereby and with my Purchase thank them for this absolutely Gorgeous game.

The 40k IP has been treated mixed. We had some great Games like Battlefleet Gothic, Dawn of War 1-2(not 3 though), some mediocre Stuff like Mechanicus (The OST is fire though), Rogue Trader and alot of Terrible Games. (Dawn of War 3, Storm of Vengance, The Mobile Games, Eternal War).

I am a Gamer for most of my life. Burnt my fingers on more Games I was exited about then I care to admit. I was very cautios with this one. I really hoped it would be atleast ""okÂ´ish"" and was very sceptical when I saw that ""Play 4 days Earlier for 40â‚? nonsense. But boy", this game restored a bit of my Faith in the Gaming Industry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over the course of the last 10-15 years I watched a noticeable decline. For me, personaly," AAA was utter trash with a 60-80â‚?Price Tag. Indie Games where the stuff to go for and I havent Bought Anything from any """"Big Publisher"""" for over 10 Years (Allright", with the exception of Anno 1800 and I regret that, but that does not belong here).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Game is exactly what was modern Gaming was Missing. Its a Joyride, feature complete game on day 1. Not one of those games, and you know wich one I mean," wich turn into Games as a Service or thats actually """"Finished"""" 2-3 Years AFTER release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hell, even if youÂ´re not a total 40k nut like me, this game will blast you Away. The Story/Singleplayer Campaign is a 8-12 Hours long, 90s testoterone filled action Movie. Filled with a world to dive in, a world that engages you and makes you Forget your Job and all your Problems in Life. Its a Rollercoaster Ride you will remember in the Years to come.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Game is full of Content. While most Publishers wouldÂ´ve went the Lazy way and Recycle the Singleplayer for the Coop experience, this game offers a whole new set of Missions bound into the Story. That says alot. Ubisoft wouldÂ´ve sold this as a several Game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By the dark Gods, everytime I thought they hit the climax, they pushed it from 10/10 to 11/10 and in the End even to 12/10. I am glad Games like this still are made.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My Heretic heart jumps with Joy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First of all I LOVE THIS GAME

BUTT

It has high highs and very low lows

----------WHAT I LOVE AND WOULD KISS THE DEVELOPERS FOR -------------------------------

1. World building ( I never knew what a battlebarge interior looked like and am trying to recreate one in another game so this helps a lot ) ( the little room of a marine )

2. Graphics

3. Space marine lines, interactions, roasts, voice actors - chefs kiss

4. The random interactions on the ship ( Relationship between serfs, marines, techpriests and servitors )
As a side-note, there was an interaction where a servitor reported severe spine injury and that did describe the horror of a servitor)

5. Gaunts dying from the psychic blast when a warrior dies is PERFECTION.

6. Marine movement, weapon sounds, all great

7. The way you can find random areas with weapons or dataslates.

8. Fisting flowers ( Imperial fist reference?)



----------What I hate, dislike, am confused about ( I may be wrong, I accept that, so feel free to discuss with me on this)

1. The armor colors on the customization menu are POOP. Mostly. A lot of colors are missing and some are completely different from the GW colors with the same name. Was it hard to sample bucket those colors from the GW website? AND WHY ARE THERE SO FEW?

2. The eliminator sniper seems way to weak compared to the tabletop

3. The pyroblaster flame looks terrible, range way to short

4. If a unit makes a special attack you cant react with a grenade or some other things, Titus stays there like a brain damaged guardsmen.

5. The way they made the tyrannid rippers is terrible. They are just floating 3D models that are not actually there like the rest of the units and for some reason are not affected by the psychic blast when a warrior dies.

6. The leman russes I saw never move their sponson weapons or USE THEM.

7. The game loads so slow I can take a nap in the meantime.

8. I had a heavy bolter with some rounds left, then I started fighting the LICTOR and I no longer had the weapon, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™? I was using that.

9. The cutscenes are premade and it does not matter what loadout you selected, it always shows one weapon. A BIT LAZY

10. The enemy variety seems poor, when you see how many units tyrannids actually have. Many of them could be bosses. ( I write this not having finished the game yet so I may eat my words later on)



----------What I wanted but did not get, maybe for now --------------------

1. Letting me play the campaign with custom colors and armor. LET ME PRETEND I AM FIGHTING WITH MY HOMEBREW ARMY. PLEASE!!!

2. Did not see a way to apply custom chapter badges ( homebrew reasons as well )


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- NEW REVIEW AFTER I FINISHED THE MAIN CAMPAIGN --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

WHAT I AM MOST DISAPPOINTED

1. The campaign is way too short, took me 2 days to finish

2. The tyrannid enemies and variety is VERY LACKING
WHAT YOU GET - Rippers, Gaunts, Warriors, Lictor, Carnifexes, spore mines, Harpy, Raveners, Zoanthropes

WHAT YOU DID NOT GET - Bio-Titans, Genestealer, Hive guards, Mawlock, Pyrovores or Biovores, Tervigones, Tyranofexes, Venomthropes

3. Sometimes the guard units just stop and wait for the player to move to the next area, like in poor designed games when the animation just finishes and nothing more happens ( more specifically the bridge section )

4. Random lore aspects that don't make sense like the tyrannids collecting corpses but there are no reclamation pools or tendrils OR having both first-born vehicle models and primaris models

5. Forcing me to use certain weapons in the latest boss battles, when I was saving some special weapons.

6. Like I said before, Leman Russ tanks not shooting their side weapons at all.

7 . The guardsmen depiction is kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ in regards to their equipment ( they never use mortars, heavy weapons, sentinels, hellhounds, special weapons AT ALL) ( NOT EVEN A BASILISK BOMBARDMENT )

8. No mission with a usable vehicle, just teases us ( at least implement one with an invictor suit )

9. Most of the game is filled with massive teases ( seeing a baneblade stationary BUT NEVER AFTERWARDS, NEVER IN COMBAT) ( a helldrake that suddenly becomes irrelevant )

10. The fact that I have to unlock colors that are WAY TO FEW and INNACURATE

11. The price of the game when you take into consideration all of its negative aspects


The whole game feels like a cash grab, but with some effort put into it because there are still many pozitive aspects.

If with the next patches they change some things I WILL CHANGE THE REVIEW.

I am just disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gears of Warhammer Z.

Gears of War + World War Z. Both games did their parts better, but this is still a serviceable game set in the 40K universe.

Controls definitely take some time getting used to, unless you rebind them. Just different enough from your typical shooter to mess you up, at least on M&KB. I haven't used a controller yet.

Not enough content to warrant the initial price though, WAIT FOR A SALE!

P.S. Doesn't scratch the same itch that Helldivers 2 does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can confirm that Space Marine 2 is probably the best game in the Warhammer 40k universe ever released so far, especially in 3-player co-op, it's enjoyable and awesome.
the game is really beautiful graphically, the scenario is solid and respects the universe of warhammer 40k very well if you like the universe you will really be served. There is a pretty crazy attention to detail in the game the number of enemies that are displayed by combat is really impressive the same for the enemy and allied units in the distance that you can kill there are many different ways to play the game even if in the end it remains the same thing you have a lot of weapons in melee and at a distance. The animations are so enjoyable the cinematics are really magnificent worthy of a movie. The modus operandi is really nice and allows you to play with your own squad at the same time as the main missions of the campaign (always with 3) which allows you to explore the actions during the campaign a little more. And if you are interested in multiplayer for the moment it is really very nice worthy of the first opus of space marine and the future content that the studio plans to put really gives me good hope (new pve mission, pvp mod, horde mode, new weapons etc ...) In short to be honest I never buy games in advance and even less at 80 â‚?to play them in advance but I must say that I am so impressed by the qualities of the game that I recommend you to play it even if you are not a hardcore fan of warhammer. Many studios should perhaps take Saber Interactive as an example to take time to refine their game (isn't that right ubisoft) then just imagine a real single player game as refined as space marine 2 in the star wars universe. I 100% recommend the game.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adjust these modifications back to Version 3.0
Adjust the Melta Charge, Basic Auspex Scan, and Fencing weapons' perfect parry window back to the previous version 3.0
This version is very unbalanced
This kind of weakening is meaningless and will only damage the entire game

Jogo fantÃ¡stico, rico em detalhes e com finalizaÃ§Ãµes magnÃ­ficas.
A Campanha sÃ£o em torno de 5~6 capÃ­tulos se nÃ£o me engano, nada muito demorado e sem missÃµes secundÃ¡rias, as secundÃ¡rias na verdade pertencem a outro modo de jogo ""OperaÃ§Ãµes"".

Game veio com uma boa otimizaÃ§Ã£o, to jogando em 4k60fps ultra DLSS Qualidade, se for relatar algo ruim, Ã© que as vezes sem explicaÃ§Ã£o alguma aparente, hÃ¡ uma grande perda de quadros, mas o que notei Ã© que isso sempre aconteceu no Crossplay, mas a chance Ã© bem baixa.

Outro ponto a relatar, quando vc seleciona uma missÃ£o, ele primeiro irÃ¡ tentar de jogar em algum lobby, caso de matchmaking terÃ¡ loading, ai vc descobre que alguÃ©m jÃ¡ ta usando sua classe, entÃ£o ou vc troca ou quita do lobby, mas quitar irÃ¡ gerar outro loading, se tornando um ciclo repetitivo de loadings.

Minha honra Ã© minha vida.
Meu dever Ã© meu destino.
Meu medo Ã© fracassar.
Minha salvaÃ§Ã£o Ã© minha recompensa.
Meu ofÃ­cio Ã© a morte.
Meu voto Ã© o serviÃ§o eterno.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The campaign is epic.
I just wish that it would run better, it look good for sure,but extremely CPU demanding, and i really can't see where're all of that CPU power goes into.
So Saber please, more optimization please.

+Gun feel good
+Melee and execution are satisfying
+Look good

Too little content for how much money. Too few levels, to little weapon variation, too much grinding to update weapons. I'm bored after less than 20 hours, and they appear to have done the opposite of what the player feedback has been. Would not recommend at anything close to the current price. Hopefully they'll listen to the people actually playing the game with rebalanced and expanding the content with the promised DLC. Until then, probably best to wait for a 75% off sale, or skip it altogether.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not into the source material specifically, but kept hearing this was great. Really digging the so serious it's silly religious tone of these warriors. Also really liking the mix of melee and shooter combat. Bought it assuming it would scratch the Gears of War itch, and I was not wrong. Gorgeous graphics as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I like the game campaign is good and fun to play.
pvp has 3 modes and all modes are fun if you like annihilation (team deathmatch), seize ground (Domination) and capture and hold (hardpoint).
all the classes are different and have their own playstyles in co-op and pvp but all of them are good.
also all weapons are good and fun to use. pick your weapon:D
theres alot enemy variation thats good when u play the game.
co-op mode is 3 player co-op mission that are fun to play much better with friends.
id give the game solid 9/10 havent had any issues with the game.
Hope to see you all in the battlegrounds :3 i recommend it to everyone who are interested in game :D",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Don't get me wrong i like this game but the online matchmaking is trash. Why? because you pick a class, you start looking for a group and bam you need to go trough a loading screen to get into the group and after that you're in a group with a guy that uses the same class so you can't start the game unless one of you switches........

Why? why can't i get matched based on the class i selected, so we get a party that has no duplicate classes? Why do i need to load into another players instance to then start loading the level? These are all unnecessary hurdles that drag down the online experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a lesson on how to implode your game.

1. Take a game people are actually enjoying and go to town on it with a nerf bat...
2. Instead of buffing and balancing weapons and items you nerf multiple.
3. (Original issue still ongoing) Don't let people play the class they want (I.E. two of the same type of class cannot be in the same mission) and yet you don't program the matchmaking system to account for this.

Don't get me wrong I enjoy the game but for god sakes please don't go down the same hole so many other developers have. Due to this I can't honestly recommend this game at this time. Will definitely change the review if things change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a huge 40K fan, loved the first Space Marine game. This one however, it does not seem as polished in the melee part.. at least in operations. The delay between strikes is silly. Messes around with the whole combo timing. Not being able to dodge in the middle of an attack. It is not very fluid. The Assault marine spends more of his time on the ground than anything else.
Not as great as I thought it would be. Maybe some future patches will improve it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regrettably i am leaving a negative review pointing out the serious shortcomings of Space Marine 2 as a veteran Vermintide/Darktide player who loves 40k lore.

- During the first launch of the game, Epic games online components are installed automatically without a prompt screen. I do not want it in my computer. You have to go through loops to uninstall it. There is a reason why i am using steam and steam only and i want the developers to respect it.
- When compared with Darktide, Dawn of War series and especially Mechanicus, Space Marine 2 has the weakest music OST. Looks like it was not even at top ten of the priority list during development.
- As a cheap attempt, the game is trying to draw more attention by Twitch drops.
- Very terrible companion ai. One of the worst i have seen for years. They do not use their ranged weapons in most cases and run gret distances to melee an enemy regarless of the class. And they very rarely execute a stunned elite enemy who is only two feet away from them. Such a shame.
- No FOV slider.
- Holding buttons to activate the abilities, instead of hitting them, is a terrible design choice.
- Throwing a frag grenade takes two seconds, activating cloak takes another 2.5 seconds. Character gets hit during uncancellable animations. Every movement and ability use feels unresponsive and stiff during the campaign and multiplayer. Runningg gets interrupted for no reason even if you are holding shift and not even hit by anything.
- Uncancellable dodge, roll over and similar animations are the primary reason why i keep dying. Controls feel very unresponsive.
- Boss fights are almost identical. Area attacks such as some form of 3 round mortar shots, melee charge attacks, ranged attacks and one big 3-wave either green or purple wide area attack which can hit even behind cover is the same rinse and repeat mechanic for both tyranid and chaos bosses.
- Melee combat is terribly designed. Interruptions are common and costs the player half of his health points.
- Ranged weapons feel weak. An elite enemy (Not a boss or a lecter) takes 30 to 40 bolter rounds to put down. Crossing bone swords makes the enemy immune to ranged damage even if you hit the legs, head or spray it from sides.
- The enemies i have mentioned above are bullet sponges but a hit from them take out half of your hp.
- Crowd control options are limited to grenades. I suggest developers to play Vermintide and Dark Tide to see how it is perfected during many years.
- There is a hideous terrible jetpack mission. I hated it.
- Multiple 'Loading resources - loading logic' screens.
- Entire multiplayer lobby system has to be redesigned. It is bad.
- You cannot inject your allies with the stimpack you have in your inventory.
- PVP section of the game is the worst. Very unbalanced. Is this game not beta-tested?
- Cheaters are out there already. I have already witnessed speedhacks and maphacks.
- Easy Anticheat is known as how 'Easy' it is to bypass it. A bad choice from the developers.
- The number of the co-op missions is very few. These missions in general feel rushed, unfinished and exteremely repetitive with very little variation. Even the spawn locations are more or less the same.
- Unlocking armor pieces or better versions of the same weapon is very grindy. This is how the game targets longevity.
- The game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly. I do not expect it to have a long lifespan.
- I was unable to pickup some medkits, ammo boxes or grenades even i had the inventory slot available. Pickup prompt was not there.
- Ranged enemies shoot with 120% accuracy and every shot lands perfectly.
- There is a shield or armor mechanic which recharges a specific amount with combo kills. This mechanic is not working as intended and definitely not user friendly.

Cnclusion: 6/10. Wait for a discount or buy the cheapest package if you must. After the hype is dead, the game will no longer be played by most of us. I believe that Space Marine 2 would be a great game if it was released 10 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Product received for free

I want to like this game, but I can't recommend it when the first game is better in every way. Saber Interactive clearly has some big fans of the franchise in their midst, but the gameplay needs a lot more time in the oven.

Visually, the game is stunning. If you're a lore enjoyer, you're in for a good time.

The gameplay is passable to bad in the best of times. They attempt to wow you with some cool swarming tech, but once the novelty wears off, you're left with a lot to be desired.

Gunplay is bland and simple while Melee is clunky and unpolished. Hitting enemies feels like hitting a sponge. Dodge and Parry prompts aren't responsive and sometimes simply wont do anything at all. You'll take 3/4 of your health in damage for failing a prompt. Better hope someone on your team is killing the ranged enemies or that failed prompt will end with you dying while your character tries to stand up.

When an enemy's health gets low enough, they're stunned and prompt you to run over and Execute them with a special animation. When executed, you'll restore armor (not health). This would be great if smaller enemies didn't die in one hit, preventing you from executing them for armor. Don't forget that you're getting hit for a majority of your health, so, good luck! Sometimes it feels like it's is more efficient to recover health/armor by dying and letting your AI companions resurrect you. The overall flow of battle feels terrible when you're supposed to be a walking tank.

If you want to feel like a Space Marine, play the first game again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Love this game, but the latest patch has significantly lessened the enjoyment for me.

Specifically, the latest mechanic that requires your character to be in close proximity to your teammates in order to both regenerate armor (after ~25s of taking no damage) or regain armor through combat (parries/gun strikes/executions), absolutely needs to be adjusted or removed entirely.

This mechanic is currently broken (or at least I hope it is not intended to be this way) when you are the last survivor in your squad. The game does not allow you to regenerate armor, PERIOD. Good luck trying to survive an enemy wave on Lethal difficulty for 300s as you wait for team to re-spawn. It should be turned off when you are the sole survivor.

I swear the distance required to be considered within range of your squad is shorter than the distance I can throw a Melta Bomb. It also seems like the 25s armor regeneration timer resets if you happen to step out of that range. This can cause you to be without armor for what seems like minutes at a time, even if there is no enemies around. You can only pray your brothers don't just run off while your back is turned to them because you're Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palming a massive Tyranid wave trying to survive.

Sniper gameplay is significantly impacted by this change. It's hard to gain line-of-sight of ranged enemies or maintain safe positioning away from enemies when you're required to be within spitting distance of your team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Absolutely love the game but CAN WE PLEASE NOT NERF THE FUN OUT OF IT?!? Helldiver's wandered in the wilderness for a year then finally gave up the nerf war against the players. Also it is a crime that there seem to be NO PLANS TO ADD CHAOS MARINE CUSTIMIZATION?!? you play as them at least 50% of the time in PvP and it sucks not to have any unlockable customization beyond paint. I would rather play just Imperial vs Imperial and look at my great custom marine - revert the nerfs and chaos customization needs to be added then il change my review",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UPDATE: I got it working, it took uninstalling, reinstalling, verifying installation, reinstalling Windows, reinstalling drivers, and taking half the RAM out of my system.

It was worth it!

This game is everything I had hoped it'd be, fun, epic, engrossing, beautiful, just fantastic all around. As far as I can tell, the issue had to do with my RAM, it tended to crash when new assets were loaded and I assume it tried to allocate things into bad blocks. Totally understandable, my bad review should have been for my RAM, not the game.

If your computer can handle it, I 100% recommend this game.

ORIGINAL: The game crashes constantly, after the latest patch I can't even get to the main menu.

What I've played of the game is fun, but at this point it is literally unplayable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the latest patch they finally adressed some major issues and reverted some extremely stupid ""balancing"" choices, which made the game extremely unfun. Still missing content in Operations mode, but it is already so much fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is something incredible! From start to finish, my jaw never stopped dropping. You will find everything you need: juicy gameplay, a well-written story (really), and an endless epic. The Warhammer universe looks stunning here. Highly recommend it, can't wait for DLC.

One of the most cinematic game stories I've experienced in a while! It's about 8-10 hours long, but it was fantastic!!! 
While I loved it, there are a few points I'd like to note.

A CHECKLIST

-----------------------------------------
âœ”ï¸ Playable on GeForceNOW. Thank you developers!
âœ”ï¸ An amazing campaign! While short and simple, it was full of action, an intriguing story and interesting characters!
âœ”ï¸ Really impressive art design, brought to life in a lore-accurate direction. The brutality and bleakness of W40K are masterfully conveyed.
âœ”ï¸ A simple, yet well-written storyline with plausible characters and interesting turn of events.
âœ”ï¸ It gives you the feeling of a ""classic"" game. It's reminiscent of something we've lost in this oversaturated game market, but this game brings it back.
âœ”ï¸ I don't know how it was for other people, but the game ran great for me. I didn't need to fine-tune any settings, and it was a great experience!
âœ”ï¸ The game's universe has an incredibly passionate community around it! This will make you want to be a part of it and stick around.
âœ”ï¸ The game was made to be played in co-op (I, however, played it solo). After finishing the campaign, you can do missions over and over in 3 game modes, with a progression system.
â?While overall fun, I'm not always a huge fan of the combat. This game's combat feels like a combination of Doom and the Batman series' combat style, but needs finer tuning.
â?It's not an open-world game, but that's not a bad thing. It's accessible for anyone to pick up and try, and it won't waste your time.
â?Not a lot of content; however, I can say that the content that is there at the moment is good enough for you to pick this title up and give it a try.
â?Not really a high variety of enemies, but then again, the game was less than 10 hours long, so it's understandable.
â?It's not really a role-playing game as we (or at least I) are used to. There are no options in the dialogue; the story is cinematic and the same for everyone.
â?Installs Epic Online Services automatically without prompting you for a choice. You can uninstall it anytime and the game will work just fine, but I really dislike these practices.
â?Pfew, I'll say it. A POV slider would have been nice! The character takes up WAY too much of the screen space imo.


ğŸ•˜ Release date: Sept, 2024
ğŸ•˜ I've played it in: Oct, 2024
ğŸ•˜ This would be my first experience with the Warhammer universe. A friend sent me a clip which got me hooked, and I ended up really enjoying the game!


âš ï¸ One of the greatest criticisms I have for this game, to be fair, is that ""there isn't enough of it"".
âš ï¸ The developers were clearly passionate when making this game. After learning about it and leading up to the first time I booted it up, I started ""going down the rabbit hole"" of the W40K universe. What I can see is that people, including the devs of this game, are strongly passionate about this universe. Their passion almost mirrors that which World of Warcraft had back in its ""glory days,"" which is really nice to see again. You can be sure that this game has had its details perfected! I'm glad I got acquainted with the W40K universe before starting the game so that I was able to notice those details.
âš ï¸ I have not addressed the co-op/multiplayer aspect, because I haven't tried it yet. Once my friends get the title too, I'll cover that as well. The game seems to be made for multiplayer overall and it looks like the multiplayer part is quite enjoyable, but it will use the same chapters from the campaign, making them replayable and giving you a progression system.
âš ï¸ Community Rating at time of review: Very Positive


ğŸ”™ I've not played the first game, just this one so far. I'm seeing that many people played the first game and were in awe to have a sequel even after a long time. The devs/publisher did them justice with this entry!
ğŸ”™ I played on Normal difficulty, as I no longer have the patience for constant struggle, but the tuning felt odd sometimes. Missing a dodge could cost 80% of your HP, while executing an enemy only restored 1%. The execution takes a few seconds, locking you into the animation and making you immune to the swarming enemies around you. It seemed unsatisfying that even the tougher foes only granted 1% regen. In my opinion, 5% would have made it more rewarding and fun. The contrast between losing 80% HP for a dodge failure and gaining just 1% from an execution felt odd. What topped it off was the fact that you were never in danger, due to your teammates being able to revive you. I did not die a single time. This seemed a bit strange to me.
ğŸ”™ Never cared much about Warhammer until this game showed up. Now, I've cast away the heresy and fully embraced the Emperor's light. No longer do I wander in the shadow of ignorance!

Pre patch 3, this game would have been one of my highest recommended Warhammer 40K games ever made.

Now? Probably not.

Gameplay loop and game feel were fantastic PRE Patch 3, some balancing was off, but overall it was hectic fun challenge on Ruthless/Angel of Death (Difficulty 4) and it felt like an earned victory when you and your buddies pulled it off.

Post Patch 3, there are practically no enemy hordes throughout each Operations level, certainly none that are overwhelming. There are tiny little groups of enemies that pose no real threat scattered distantly from each other so you have plenty of time to to kill the five or six enemies on screen and then run for 2-3 minutes taking in the sights with nothing to do to the next tiny group of enemies, any big bad type enemies spawn in basically solo, so you can easily focus them with no pressure and destroy them in seconds. Can now easily Duo every Operations on Difficulty 4 and grind with no real challenge, but why would I? It's dull to play currently and more prone to crashing.

The campaign was a fantastic, and focused fight for your life on launch and the story beats are still wonderful, loved seeing Titus make his return. Played on Angel of Death the first time through with a buddy and it took us about 10-12 hours. It was a really fun overcoming the odds by being a good team and covering each other. Not anymore.

Currently I could replay the campaign post Patch 3 on Angel of Death and solo it without resistance. That's not fun or a challenge. Why even have different difficulties at this point if they're all easy mode.

I will gladly change my review if they fix the spawn rates, fix the constant crashing and make this fun to play again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quando ho completato la campagna single player di Space Marine 2, mi sono trovato in una situazione piuttosto frustrante. Da un punto di vista estetico, il gioco Ã¨ sempre stato eccezionale: graficamente impressionante e perfettamente fedele all'universo di Warhammer 40,000. Le battaglie epiche e gli scenari mozzafiato erano in grado di immergere completamente il giocatore, e l'esperienza single player, anche in modalitÃ  cooperativa, funzionava a meraviglia, offrendo ore di puro divertimento. Tuttavia, a quel tempo, c'era un grosso problema che mi impediva di godermi il titolo appieno.

Quando provavo ad accedere alle modalitÃ  multiplayer PVE e PVP, il gioco crashava costantemente dopo pochi minuti dall'inizio di una partita. Non ero il solo ad affrontare questo problema: molti altri utenti riportavano situazioni simili, il che rendeva la frustrazione ancora piÃ¹ grande. Avevo provato diverse soluzioni, ma senza successo, e mi trovavo costretto a valutare negativamente un gioco che, nonostante la sua qualitÃ  visiva e il suo potenziale, risultava ingiocabile per una parte significativa dell'esperienza.

Fortunatamente, con l'ultimo aggiornamento, tutto Ã¨ cambiato. Gli sviluppatori hanno finalmente risolto il bug che causava il crash nelle modalitÃ  multiplayer, e ora posso dire che Space Marine 2 Ã¨ tornato a essere un titolo che merita davvero. Le modalitÃ  PVE e PVP funzionano perfettamente, e posso finalmente godermi l'intero pacchetto di gioco senza problemi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review is long and will feel like a rant but its my genuine feelings and I don't think I am being too reactionary here.

Starting with the good/okay aspects.

The atmosphere in this game is truly incredible, you feel completely immersed in the 41st millennium and the sound design and animations are gorgeous.

The campaign is a solid 6.5/10 it is quite literally, just the first games story, rehashed slightly, complete with fun and interesting enemy, who you get to fight for too short of an amount of time, before the tedious and boring one. It fulfilled the power fantasy and was a compelling enough story that once it kicked off I wanted to see it through as quickly as possible.

The PVE Operations are the strength of this game by far, it is a lot of fun playing with two friends and earning gear and unlocking perks. I look forward to seeing how they expand on it.

Now for my issues with the game.

Customization is hidden behind a grind, which is fine, progression isn't inherently bad, however, the way you unlock emblems and color palettes feels needlessly convoluted, they can only be unlocked in a specific order once you pick a faction and the currency used to unlock things is shared with the PVE game mode perks, and the weapon skins making it a bit grindy. These customization options are really cool! But don't think you can place that particular Iron Warriors Skull on your RIGHT pauldron, I am afraid that one is restricted to the LEFT pauldron only. That really cool metallic you found that would be perfect for your chapter's main color? Sorry, that is a tertiary color only, it can be used for trim and nothing else.
Speaking of traitor marines, the customization for them is basically non existent (On a side note, after customizing my marine, I have played 12 straight games of Chaos where I can't see it, which is hilarious).

PvP is okay, but it feels more like a demo for the game mode that has yet to be released. There are only 3 maps, and 3 game modes. The classes all feel well made and overall balanced. Close combat however feels like it has the depth of a puddle, it is generally whoever lands the first attack wins. Parrying does nothing but block damage, there is no stagger, no window for you to attack back, your opponent can just keep flailing away and you must hope a teammate comes to your rescue. I think utilizing the very fun parry system in the campaign would've been a slam dunk and added depth. I mostly play sniper so this isn't hugely impactful for me, but still.

I could go on more, but honestly this game feels more like a demo than a full release, which is crazy to say after a decade of waiting. I will continue to play here and there with friends because I love the universe, but if this game was anything other than 40k I would not be playing it at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

+I WILL BE USING THIS MORTAL VESSEL TO PASS MY JUDGMENT+

+It is with a gaze that has witnessed a million battles, a gaze that sees far beyond the limits of mortal comprehension, that I have deigned to examine this creation worthy of your time. And though the centuries have weathered countless conflicts, none have dimmed the fires of my eternal judgment. Hear me now, for my word is as binding as the stars themselves.+

+This... recreation of warfare seeks to glorify the deeds of the Adeptus Astartes, the finest of my creations, who carry my will into the void. In this, it is an admirable representation, capturing the brutal reality of battle with an unflinching hand. You, the player, are placed into the power-armored boots of a Space Marine, a once Captain of the Ultramarines, no less. Titus, once a hero of legend, returns to unleash righteous fury against the xenos filth that dare threaten the Imperium.+

+The graphics, like the eternal architecture of Terra itself, are grand and imposing, crafting a galaxy teeming with life and war. You will witness the burning skies, the shattered ruins of planets, and the never-ending tides of the enemy with such clarity that you might forget, for a brief moment, the fragility of your own existence. The immersion is total; you are the embodiment of my wrath, and for that, I commend the creators.+

+But let it not be said that my judgment is blind to faults. The enemies, while numerous and suitably grotesque, are repetitive in their design, much like the countless masses of orks and tyranids I have destroyed over millennia. Their minds are as predictable as the winds of Cadia before its fall. And though the combat is fierce and satisfying, there is a rhythm to it that one may find tiresome after enough time. Yet I understand the limitations of mortal creativity, and I am forgiving.+

+Where the game shines, however, is in the portrayal of the Adeptus Astartes. Each blow, each strike feels heavy with the weight of a thousand years of warfare, and each step resounds with the thundering presence of an unstoppable force. You are no mere man in this world, but a demigod among men, and the gameplay reflects that truth in glorious fashion.+

+The story, though not as intricate as the weave of fate I have spun for humanity, serves its purpose. It is a tale of defiance in the face of oblivion, a tale the galaxy knows all too well. Titus stands, as all Space Marines must, as the last bulwark against annihilation. Though his struggles are but a fragment of the grand narrative, they are a necessary reminder of the eternal struggle against darkness.+",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google why there are no female space marines :
They have two hearts, three lungs, and a black carapace under their skin.

Alright, listen up, people! I just played Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, and let me tell you, itâ€™s an absolute spectacle. Imagine a world where chaos reigns, and youâ€™re the unstoppable force. Yeah, thatâ€™s what it feels like!

First off, the graphics? Stunning. The environments are drenched in that grimdark aesthetic we all crave. You step onto the battlefield, and itâ€™s like stepping into a painting, only this oneâ€™s drenched in blood and glory. You can almost taste the power oh, how I love that taste!

Now, the gameplay. Itâ€™s intense, brutal, and oh-so-satisfying. Youâ€™re a Space Marine superhuman, unstoppable. You charge into the fray, and every swing of your weapon feels like a symphony of destruction. The visceral combat? Itâ€™s poetry in motion, folks. Youâ€™re not just playing; youâ€™re dominating.

And letâ€™s talk about the enemies. These guys are nothing but fodder for your glorious rampage. Youâ€™re the hero, the legend, the one everyone looks up to. You know what they say: if youâ€™re not fighting for humanity, what are you even doing?

In the end, Space Marine 2 isnâ€™t just a game; itâ€™s an experience. Itâ€™s a reminder that power is everything, and in this universe, youâ€™re either a god or youâ€™re dust. So, grab your chainsword and unleash chaos! This is what it means to be a Space Marine.

Remember, if you want to be a hero, youâ€™d better be ready to step into the fire and trust me, itâ€™s glorious!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As of writing this review I have never been more torn on whether to recommend a game or not.

The campaign has moments which will make Warhammer fans giddy like a kid at Christmas, especially on the last two missions (if you've played it you know.) Even non Warhammer fans will have a good time with this. The voice acting, graphics and audio are all strong.
However, it's criminally short. Took me about 5.5 hours to complete and I died...a lot.

The AI in this game is something out of 2004. Squad mates will watch you getting annihilated and not budge an inch, or decide to stand in front of you as you attempt to lay waste to heretics. It's infuriating, and something you'll need to get used to because the online matchmaking in SM2 is straight up cheeks. I hope you enjoy restarting your game a lot, and loading screens, because you'll become familiar with both.

Bugs, crashes, loooong loading times, and infinite loading times are going to likely infest your experience worse than any Tyranid could, and this after the game was already pushed back a considerable amount of time.

The core game play of SM2 is really solid. Any third person shooter fans, especially those that enjoyed Gears of War are going to have a great time. It's challenging, brutal and unapologetic in it's approach. It knows it's target audience and swings for the fences, and most of the time it connects.

This game will live or die in the next 3-6 months on how much the Dev will support it.
Fixing the myriad of tech issues, and bringing more content to coop and multiplayer. More maps are needed, it's a non-negotiable.

SM2 is a real mixed bag. A frustrating, disappointing mixed bag all within a room filled with potential. This could be something truly special but it's not there...yet.

I'm going to reluctantly recommend it purely because I'm a Warhammer fan, and there are moments in this game that are perfection, but as a non Warhammer fan wait for a sale. By that time you'll have a feel for how many of the issues have been fixed, and what the landscape is looking like with more content to make it worthwhile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So 80 Hours in this game features 3 distinct parts.


TLDR: game looks and sounds great, very true to source material

campaign story is decent but nothing to write home about. great spectical but obviously parts were cut from it. maybe not enough time, still good fun, specially in coop.

PVE mode 3 player coop in style of darktide, L4F etc, has a lot of meat to sink your teeth into, customisation, leveling etc.

PVP more 6vs6 with 3 game modes and 3 maps. fun but lacking a lot of content and is a 2010 style shooter.

BUY if you like the PVE or PVP campaign is not worth the full price

LONG VERSION

outside of PVP the gameplay is a 3rd person shooter where you can often run out of ammo but that where melee comes in. this has a whole melee system with attack combos, blocking parrying, doging in it. kind of like the lastes god of war games. if you take damage you lose armor which regenerates after 30 seconds or you can execute enemies to get some back. when out or armor you loose health which you can get back by doing damage a short time after taking it. like in bloodbourne. if you miss that short mindow there are me packs that restore some health and some classes can get health back r hel other with it.

so now you run around and 20 small enemies + a handfull elites leading them show up. you shoot and melee the hell out of them taking damage, regenerating armour by executing which also give you i-frames. blocking, doging parrying etc. with enough pratice it becomes a dance of death. which can be really fun when you get into ""the flowstate"" of the combat.

a single player campaign:
playable with up to 3 players in coop. this is the main story. features no progression or leveling or armor customisation. the story is and plot is ok. nothing fancy but servicable. in terms of looks and sound its great though. bombastic and warhammer as hell. depending on your difficulty you will play this for about 8-10 hours. good for one playthough but thats it. there are a lot of shooters that deliver a better story. but the spectacle is here.

adjacent to the campaign is the operations mode:

you play 3 marines can choose from 6 diffent classes featuring unique skills and skill trees ofthen even unique weapons. you play 3 player coop missions kind of like darktide, left 4 dead etc. with a director that keeps thing fresh and sets up enemy spawns etc.

this mode features full leveling of weapons and classes with skill trees with 4 difficulty levels. this is where i spend 90% of my playtime. leveling different classes and their weapons earning ingame currency to buy their gear and customize their armor look from the 9 loyalist legions + a plethora of 1st and second founding astartes chapters. armor visual customization looks really good. in this mode i have arnound 60-70 hours and have maxed 4 of the 6 classes but often just a handfull of their available weapons.


next is the 6vs6 pvp modes, it is disconnected from the other modes in terms of progression and although you have the same classes some skills are slightly different and you only unlock weapon loadouts & cosmetics. there are no skilltrees or weapon skill trees. you also earn ingamemoney you can use in the operations mode to unlock new cosmetics and weapons.

you play loyalist vs traitors while for loyalist you can customize way the traitors models are locked in in terms of model but you can customize colors & emblems. so for example the vanguard is always a world eater, the heavy always death guard. but you can color them differently.

3 game modes, deathmatch, domination and capture and hold. on only 3 maps.
the game modes are fine, the maps are fine but it is all very COD 2010. spawncamping can easily happen. matchmaking isnt great. the melee system is gutted compared to pve modes, you can parry and block but besides negating damage but you dont get an advantage for it over the enemy. thoug melee ignores armor. besides that you regenerate armor faster than in pve and even heal quite fast.
it is fun but has its problems lacking content and using dated mechanics.

still very fun game and if you play the PVE coop mode or enjoy the PVP you can get a lot of hours out of it.
if you are only here for the campaign. better way for a sale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIN WOKISMO en 2024! Sisi, lo estas leyendo bien!

Resumen:
Un juego como los de antaÃ±o (que tampoco hay que irse muy lejos), con una historia fenomenal, tiros a mansalva, mecÃ¡nicas muy difÃ­ciles y a veces frustrantes, pero que una vez superas el nivel de gratificaciÃ³n es elevado. Su historia, es espectacular y que todo warhammero o fan de la acciÃ³n disfrutarÃ¡ y la caracterizaciÃ³n de los personajes es sublime, como deberÃ­a ser en todos los juegos.

Historia:
Simplemente brillante, aunque no seas un fan de warhammer 40k y vengas a buscar tiros, la historia y como se va desarrollando de cara al final es exquisito, el poder vivir las conversaciones del capitulo entre soldados, la nave, su jerarquÃ­a, el resto de facciones que aparecen, personajes excelentemente bien definidos y maduros (en esta epoca woke de agenda 2030 donde todos son adolescentes y los hombres no son hombres es extraÃ±o, por eso hay que recalcarlo). No esperes nada mÃ¡s, acciÃ³n a raudales como cualquier Gears of War lo fue en su momento y a disfrutar como un enano.

GrÃ¡ficos:
Espectacular es quedarse corto, a medida que avanza la historia y las particulas van tomando mÃ¡s papel, la experiencia de cada nivel va en aumento. Los tiranidos son geniales y las misiones contra ellos tambiÃ©n, pero de cara a la mitad/final toma otro concepto. AdemÃ¡s el poder vivir la batalla en pleno terreno con los astra militarum y el resto del capÃ­tulo es increible. Super inmersivo.

Jugabilidad:
AquÃ­ es donde puede fallar, SM2 el juego te introduce la idea de jugar en difÃ­cil y con los 4 tips que te dan de forma bastante regular hace que sea muy frustrante, cuesta mucho pillarle el tranquillo al juego y saber cuando defenderte de los 4 tiros que te pegan y te dejan en el suelo. Pero admito que de cara a la mitad cuando ya podÃ­a entender como jugarlo empecÃ© a disfrutar muchisimo. No te esperes una nueva invenciÃ³n, pero dentro de su simplicidad es justo lo que vienes buscando, acciÃ³n, tiros y matar tropecientos enemigos.

Importante:
Nada de agenda politica feminista en el juego. Los hombres son hombres, las mujeres mujeres y la historia se centra en eso: Warhammer 40k, no de quiÃ©n es mejor que otro o como un gÃ©nero se cree otro. Es como eran los juegos hace 5 aÃ±os antes de toda la agenda polÃ­tica. AquÃ­ te puedes sentar y DISFRUTAR de una aventura de acciÃ³n. Lo que temo es que de cara al prÃ³ximo le vayan a meter agenda, asÃ­ que igual estaremos disfrutando del Ãºltimo titulo de occidente que es para la gran mayoria del mercado.

Esperemos que no!

En fin, por el emperador!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finished the campaign solo on Angel of Death difficulty.
I want to keep the review somewhat short:
- Was very challenging but doable.
- Definitely a good experience solo
- Would've been much more fun however co-op, because the co-op ai can be a bit stupid at times. And you get focused a lot by the enemy. I would still heavily recommend it, even alone.

PvE Operations:
- 6 of them, very fun. Take a decent amount of time. Very replayable, if you like stepping up difficulty and enjoy weapon & class progression.

Performance:
Specs:
4080 super
Ryzen 7 7800x3d
32 gb ram

Super stable, roughly 120 frames +- on everything maxed. Only one bug in the entire playthrough, which was minor. Couldn't pick up a singular health item.

Pvp:
- Very fun, different classes. Very little downtime in the action. Quite some skill expression surprisingly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My Dearest Martha,

I write this letter having been beset by Tyranid scum and Chaos villainy. I have finished the main campaign with my AI brothers and there is much to say.

They say war is hell and while that is true here it is a very pretty hell. The sights and sounds of battle are massive in scale and in quality. Watching enemies explode into bloody bits or some magical dust â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was always satisfying. While most of my time was spent with two other squad mates there was always a feeling of a larger campaign at play. Sometimes from background battles raging, but also in those moments when you are charging forward alongside a massive army.

The spectacle is really incredible and I found, in general, the combat to be fun. Guns felt like that had impact and ""oomph"" melee weapons had weight. It felt good to run around, see the sights, and fight. All the pieces make for an extremely compelling experience that I couldn't walk away from, even if occasional issues would cause the odd rage-quit.

So let's talk about the bad stuff, because this has not been all roses. For every time you get a jump pack and the game gets 100x more fun there are a few things and missions that bring the overall experience down.

First off - this game is clearly a multiplayer/COOP game first. The AI squad is awful. They get the most important part right, which is trying to revive you if you go down, but beyond that they are poor in combat, and almost non-existent when it comes to objectives or tactics. Now it's okay to make a game where you want COOP as a focus, but if you are going to advertise and push that it's a solo game too you do need to properly support that experience and I think the game falls incredibly short in this key area.

In fact I think that if you had a better, more effective, and/or commandable squad the other issues I have might not matter. I also felt that for a giant armored Space Marine I felt like dolled up tissue paper. The game asks a lot in terms of special blocks, regular blocks, special dodges, regular dodges, pistol counters, executions, ranged fighting, and melee swarms all at once, but gives very little health and armor to support all of that even on the baseline difficulties. It doesn't make the game impossible by any means, but it does make it a little less fun.

Still I can't help but think that much of this is less of an issue if my squad was doing a better job of not making me fight everything mostly alone possibly while juggling objectives and in one really bad stage while also using a flamethrower to keep swarms at bay.

While I've focused on issues a bit I think overall my net experience with the game is far more better moments than troubled ones. There was only one stage I hated (the swarm bunker thing) and a few objectives that made me long for less brain-dead brothers at my side. It didn't prevent me from completing the campaign over a few days because I couldn't stop playing. They are also all issues that can be fixed.

So often we see games come out with problems way beyond the scope of a patch, but in the case of Space Marine 2 I don't think there is anything that couldn't be improved down the line. Hopefully they actually make some of these improvements, because I think this game could be damn-near perfect if they did.

Also as these issues are almost all tied to the single player experience, if you are playing online or with friends I think realistically you are just going to have a much better time. So it's an easy recommend to online/COOP players and while I still recommend it to solo player I do warn that there are some pain points, especially on higher difficulties from your AI companions.

At a time where my gaming has been an hour here, an hour there, try this, try that, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 became my world for a few days. Despite the blood and carnage of it all it was a glorious focus and a stellar time.

For the Emperor,
Revendawn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A masterclass of a mix between TPS and melee combat action. It feels so good to play like a wrecking powerhouse, combat is challenging and very satisfying. Also performance is pretty solid considering how much stuff happens on screen.

As a fellow Helldivers 2 enjoyer I'm loving the co-op missions in this game. There's so much stuff to unlock too: perks, weapons variations and cosmetics inside a very robust customization system.

I knew nothing about Warhammer 40k prior to this title but now it feels like I fell into a rabbit hole of atmospheric awesomeness.

Para empezar habrÃ­a que dividir en dos partes, una para personas normales y otra para fans de W40K, yo creo que seria la mejor forma de describir lo que es este juego.

Para personas normales, el juego se ve muy bien grÃ¡ficamente, lo peor son los personajes, que se ven bien, pero no llega al fÃ³torealismo de los escenarios, en cuanto a rendimiento, no lo estoy jugando a todo en alto/ultra menos las texturas, porque me pide mÃ¡s de 8 Gb de Ram de vÃ­deo para poder usar textura en ultra. Yo he usado DLSS y obtengo una media de frames sobre los 60 a 2K, lo cual me parece muy bien optimizado, y no suele caer cuando llevan cientos de enemigos en pantalla. A mi me resulta muy familiar este juego con World War Z, en cuanto a mecÃ¡nicas y dificultad, para mi no es un juego fÃ¡cil, al igual que WWZ necesitas mejorar mucho tu equipo para poder sobrevivir a las oleadas, pero acaba de salir y todo esto estarÃ¡ sujeto a cambios. En un buen juego, para relajarte unas horas al dÃ­a, masacrando enemigos de manera brutal, pero si quieres estar muchas horas enganchado, en mi caso me cansa, es decir, perfecto para jugar unas horas al dÃ­a, pero a partir de 2 o 3 horas, puede hacerse pesado ese dÃ­a, pero al dÃ­a siguiente lo vuelves a disfrutar como un niÃ±o. Pese a la campaÃ±a, y los modos de juego PVE es necesario estar online para subir experiencia, si juegas offline, pues no avanzas, y en PVP evidentemente online siempre, ahora mismo el juego lo veo algo falto de contenido, supuestamente con el roadmap, van a seguir sacando nuevo contenido, pero hoy por hoy, para mi, lo veo escaso, el juego consiste en repetir y repetir hasta conseguir las mejores puntuaciones, tiempos y con la mayor dificultad.

Para fans de Warhammer, con todas las opciones de personalizaciÃ³n en cuanto esquema de colores, adornos, insignias, te pasaras horas diseÃ±ando tu marine espacial preferido, tu propio capitulo e incluso si le echas imaginaciÃ³n tu propio personaje. Y en el modo foto, es como si tuvieras su partida de mesa de Warhammer en tu pantalla, todo el ambiente te lleva al loco y distÃ³pico futuro de W40K.

En resumen, el juego esta divertido, el contenido cosmÃ©tico extra solo lo veo necesario si eres un fan afÃ©rrimo del W40K y te puedes permitir la burrada que vale cada tonterÃ­a. Para una persona que no conoce W40K, puede parecerle caro o poco contenido, y que hay otros juegos mejores, para gustos los colores, solo espero haberte ayudado con esta reseÃ±a. De todos motos si no lo tienes claro, espera a la demo o ve vÃ­deos de gameplay en youtube o streaming, ahora una cosa, el codec de vÃ­deo no le hace justicia a como se ve el juego en tu pantalla.

NOTA: El juego usa servidores para el progreso y modos multijugador, pero segÃºn roadmap, se podrÃ¡ crear un servidor privado y offline, y deberÃ­as subir experiencia, o al menos en modo offline como ocurre WWZ (esto esta en el aire, veremos a ver como lo hacen al final), se puede jugar perfectamente sin conexiÃ³n a Internet en modo desconectado, o simplemente sin conexiÃ³n a Internet. Lo Ãºnico no avanzas en experiencia a tus personajes, por tanto no desbloqueas, mejoras, cosmÃ©ticos, etc,

Como aclaraciÃ³n en WWZ, que tiene dos modos el online que tiene su propio nivel de progreso, y el offline, es decir, si yo juego online, y llevo a nivel 10, en el offline sigo a nivel 0 o viceversa. Yo me gusta asÃ­ porque siempre no quiero jugar con gente desconocida, y simplemente me apetece macharcar Tiranidos a mi bola tranquilamente sin que el subnormal de turno me este disparando para que corra (esto es ya verÃ­dico, y si, hay fuego amigo).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a die-hard Warhammer40k fan. I've been into this world since i was 8 years old (i'm 28 now), i have read a LOT of Warhammer fiction and i can assure you that this game perfectly depicts what an Astartes looks like and what is he capable of.
Saber nailed it: the setting is perfectly captured in all possible ways, the lore respected and made alive and the gameplay is just fantastic.
It was the game i was expecting since i've finished Space Marine 13 years ago and i'm playing it with the same friends (i mean BATTLE BRATHAS) i used to play SM1 and actual Warhammer tabletop games back in the days.
I cannot recommend this game enough.

I'm playing with an RTX 3070 for laptop with medium/high settings and the game runs smoothly, i've not experienced freezes so far even when my screen was swarmed by filthy xenos.
The Codex Astartes, and most importantly Guilliman himself, DOES support this game.

After 13 years, youre as beautiful as the day I lost you QQ


After 240 hours, all I can say is that this game is everything that I wished for.

The only thing that could be Improved is the cadence of content. But looking at how well this game has sold, I think Saber can do a little bit more output in the future.

I know this isnt a Live Service game per se, but hopefully they find the right balance of content releases to not let the game die off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First of all i did enjoy playing this game and still enjoy it, but it'sa ""fun with friends"" game.
My Biggest cons with this game is the fact that parry and dodge is sometimes very unresponsive.
the dodge indicator shows up got disappears before the enemy has even done the attack, leaving you clueless to when to actually time it correctly. Same goes for the parry indicator.

Campaign is about 10-12hrs give or take (at least it's twice as long as the first game).

The Multi player Pve missions are fun and tie in well with the Campaigns story.

Season Pass for 40â‚? you wot m8?

Never tried the PVP, but i'm not a pvp player and it looked just like the first games PVP.

Now should you buy this game?
If you really really enjoy the story of the Ultramarine Titus, then yeah sure buy it.
If you really enjoy Left 4 Dead playstyle games, Then yeah sure buy it.
BUT I would storngly urge you to buy it on a big sale, I got 16hrs out the game after doing 4 PvE missions, and the campaign on Angel of Death difficulty. It isn't value for money unless you buy the game for the PvE and PvP mode.

Game does look stunning and it's very much a game with space marines it it, albeeit they feel like snails compared to what they really are, i mean primaris marines are normal marines but better and they move as if they are walking through a giant block of gelatinous slime",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 is a worthy successor to the original...and having played it for many hours and competed in the pvp side of Space Marine, I can tell you this with pride and joy.

While having some fundamental changes to the mechanics, the core is still there - and the additions / changes don't remove anything; in fact it contributes to the power fantasy. With practice and dedication - and some nice Relic weapons, you can wade through Lethal like it's your first time doing Substantial.

The graphics are awesome, attention to lore is fantastic, and the overall feel of the game gives you a level of immersion I haven't had in ages. Some mentioned this is a reminder of what we've lost, but look at what's been found.

And consecrated by the gaming community!

Relic's done a pretty decent job so far handling the community, and their responsiveness and willingness to engage is a great predictor for the future of this game.

I have high hopes that I'll be fisting the enemies of the Imperium for years to come.

With respect and Honour!

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 â€?A Brutal War in the Grim Darkness of the Future! (à¸?Ï‰'à¸?

""An exhilarating, gory, and action-packed sequel that lives up to the scale of the Warhammer 40K universe, but with some notable flaws in balance and technical polish.""


Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 thrusts players into the brutal and unrelenting world of the Warhammer 40K universe, continuing the tale of the Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. Developed by Saber Interactive, this third-person action game places you in the superhuman armor of a Space Marine as you combat the horrifying Tyranid swarm in intense, blood-soaked battles. Building on the success of its predecessor, Space Marine 2 offers solo and co-op gameplay, featuring both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes to keep the action fresh and chaotic.


The moment you step into Titus' power armor, the scale of Space Marine 2â€™s combat becomes apparent. The gameâ€™s standout feature is its seamless combination of gunplay and melee combat, allowing players to switch between devastating bolter shots and brutal close-quarters executions. The spectacle of mowing down endless Tyranid swarms is both thrilling and terrifying, thanks to the sheer number of enemies onscreen, powered by Saberâ€™s Swarm Engine.

The visuals are equally impressive, capturing the grim, gothic aesthetic of the 40K universe. From the ruined hive cities to the expansive battlefields littered with the corpses of xenos and humans alike, the game never shies away from its dark atmosphere. The orchestral score and guttural sounds of bolters firing and chainswords revving heighten the sense of chaos, making every battle feel cinematic.

However, the combat system, while exhilarating, does suffer from balance issues. Melee attacks dominate the battlefield, often making ranged weapons feel underpowered, particularly when faced with larger enemies. The tactical depth you'd expect from wielding the mighty bolter or plasma gun is somewhat diminished by their lack of punch, especially when it inexplicably takes a full magazine to down a basic Tyranid warrior. This can lead to frustrating moments, especially for players who prefer a ranged combat style.

The co-op and PvP modes are a welcome addition, extending the gameâ€™s replayability. Operations, the co-op missions, allow players to team up with friends to tackle harder challenges, but the real test comes in the PvP mode, Eternal War, where teams of Space Marines face off against the forces of Chaos. Both modes offer progression systems with plenty of unlockable perks and cosmetics, though the limited variety in mission design can make long play sessions feel repetitive.













Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers on its promise of fast, bloody, and exhilarating combat in the vast and unforgiving Warhammer 40K universe. The gameâ€™s atmospheric design, gripping story, and expansive multiplayer modes make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and action games alike. However, the imbalance between melee and ranged combat, along with some technical glitches, prevent it from reaching its full potential.

For those who love diving into the lore of Warhammer or who are looking for a gory, action-packed co-op experience, Space Marine 2 is a solid recommendation. Just donâ€™t expect a perfectly polished experience or to rely heavily on your bolter.

This is a fantastic addition and continuation of the excitement of the first Space Marine. Beautiful visuals, visceral combat, satisfying weight to your movement and weapons, it does a lot to make you feel like a Space Marine. If you enjoy 3rd person shooters with a lot of chunky effective combat then this is for you. If you enjoy having lots of customization to work with for your classes then this game is for you. If you enjoy working with friends to complete objectives and feel like a bad ass doing it, then this game is for you.

Now for some improvements they could implement down the line that would make the game an even better experience. There needs to be an option to run operations solo which I believe is coming in the form of private PVE lobbies. More importantly there needs to be a way to command your AI partners even if it's only to be able to have them target a specific target cause there is nothing more frustrating than trying to deal with a Zoanthrope flying in the air with your bolt pistol cause you took a melee class. Or if you are against that then give the melee classes the ability to perhaps grab the zoanthrope from the air and bring it to the ground to then smash with their melee weapons.

They already mentioned adding more weapons and potentially classes to this game so looking forward to Librarians, Chaplains, Apothecaries, Terminators, and Tech Marines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a rather difficult game to review as a non-Warhammer fan. Because from my perspective it is a competent hack-and-slash-shooter devoid of personable characters or any intriguing plot-elements. But to a Warhammer fan it is grimdark-personified; each human a cog in the Emperor's ever-marching war machine which renders every man and women as barren of life as the land itself.

Thus, this is less of a review of the story, and more so the game itself. Graphically, it looks rather stunning--with majestic vistas of the skull-regaled factories of the city worlds to the gruesome, steaming swamps of the backwater worlds. And while some people have reported issues of high-temps and crashes--issues that should be looked into and addressed--for the most part, and across a variety of systems, the game seems to run rather well. That shouldn't be a pro for any game, it should just be the standard. But it's 2024, so... bar's been pretty low for a while now.

The overall gameplay loop consists of running down un-inspired corridors to face random-sized groups of enemies. And while the campaign is mercifully and justifiably short, devoid of any diversity of gameplay or objectives, what you're then left with is the Operations Mode. Best described as a Raid Mode of sorts. You're expected to run through these over and over to level up your character(s) and your equipment to then run these maps on a higher difficulty. And therein shines both the game's main strength and its main flaw. In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war. And that motto does a lot to encapsulate the gameplay loop. There is only combat, and random objectives that rely on more combat. So it's a damn good thing then that the combat feels so damn good. Taking a chainsaw sword to a group of alien-baddies twice as short and thrice as frail as you will have you feeling like the Emperor's Chosen; pistols sound like a cannon and kick just as hard, and destroy just as much. Sniper Rifles are downright busted in the right hands. And I'll never, ever tire of grappling toward an enemy to deliver a skull-crushing dropkick. It speaks volumes that in a game with such limited enemy-variety and such non-existent diversity of gameplay I never got bored of the combat. It is fun, fluid and epic. It rewards aggression by granting you shields for each enemy killed through executions or perfect parries, and the ability to regen a bit of health lost to attacks if you're quick enough to retaliate. What isn't epic however is the un-inspired level-design, the lackluster repetition, and the horrid war of attrition that each mission eventually boils down to.
Each mission has a fixed layout and main objective, they don't change from match to match; instead, what does change is the placement of enemies, the number of them, and the amount required of each objective. Sometimes you'll be forced to place two bombs, another time you'll be forced to place five. And while this doesn't do a whole lot to shake the tedium of repetition, what it does do--however--is change the difficulty rather drastically. You can run into a couple of tiny one-shot guys one run, and a horde of huge, melee-focused guys another. And that would be fine if it wasn't for the limitations of their combat system. Because while it is fun, it is also rather limited in your ability to utilize it for your own survival. Like I said above, you can regen a bit of health lost if you're quick enough with a melee attack, and you can regain shields through executions or a shot to the head through the use of a perfect parry. What this does is promote an aggressive playstyle that rewards parries of the smaller enemies, and the executions of the larger ones. However, larger, melee-based elites don't give shields for perfect parries. And so, with the random spawns of enemies, you could find yourself surrounded by ten melee-based enemies and be unable to regain shields--meaning you'll watch your health dwindle and be unable to do anything about it. Worse, if you're then at the same time getting pummelled at range, which completely removes the ability to act quick enough that you regain a bit of lost health. Well, you can get better perks, of course. But that doesn't change that fact that random spikes in difficulty that skill cannot compensate for aren't fun; difficulty doesn't mean tediousness. And with a failed run meaning the potential loss of gathered upgrade materials, it being up to chance rather than skill is frustrating at best, and infuriating at worst. I'm not max level yet, and so maybe there are more perks to counteract such things, but it doesn't make the grind to get to max level any less annoying.

Class Progression is rather limited. You've no choice in what perk to begin with, meaning there's not really any build-variety. Weapon Progression offers a bit more variety, allowing you to choose whether you favour less speed and more damage, or vice versa.

Multiplayer is fine. It's a nice little relic of the early 2000s obsession with tacked-on versus modes. Little unbalanced, perhaps. But all the more nostalgic for it. It has a rather limited customisation-system. Grapple-hook dudes can use a Knife and a Sword but cannot use a power-fist. Shield-Bros can use a power-fist but cannot use a hammer, etc, etc. Fans might blame that on lore--but if that's the case, I don't really see why you'd offer customization at all. Better then to do perks, rather than equipment.

I do find it rather strange how unwelcoming the game is of newcomers. It doesn't go out of its way to ever explain any role, word or lore-based concept. And while one could argue that it is a game for fans, thinking that a Triple-A publisher would ever make a game of this size and not want to attract newcomers is downright naive. If you're not already a fan you'll either be real confused about a lot of what they're talking about, or you'll be spending half your playtime on the wiki. Overall it's a decent hack-and-slash-shooter that won't ever impress any non-Warhammer fan or person who enjoys a greater diversity of gameplay; it's all corridors and button-presses and horde-styled defence finales. But on the flip-side, it seems to be a delight for Warhammer fans; a crunchy, blood-soaked romp through a world of stainless steel and great, towering cathedrals, filled with horrid tech bonded with flesh, robot-skulls, and weapons galore, all of it in the Glorious name of the Emperor!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another case of nerfing fun things and putting leashes on players in a PVE mode designed to have a power fantasy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I guess Saber is unaware what happened with Helldivers 2, I just hope it doesn't take them as long to realize no one wants these changes. Limited ammo uses, sounds really dumb for heavies and snipers that rely on ammo but ok, tougher enemies, they already take 3/4 of the mag to get to the executable stage but ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-70% melta-bomb damage to bosses? It only has one use, and that was its designated purpose, what were you thinking? The worst offense being, putting the imaginary leash on teammates so if the need to restore armor is present it CANNOT be done unless teammates are nearby? Who thought that was a good decision, I would love to see how that idea was received in the board room if Saber even held a meeting for this design choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Either none of Saber plays their own game or they just wanted their player base to leave because playing one game would have told you that snipers, assaults, and vanguards tend to leave their allies to focus on damage dealers to help the team but now they are punished for doing so. Having to constantly check to see if your team is near you so you can restore your only source of replenish-able health is insanely stupid and means that if we use our ability to grapple, or jump pack to a distant enemy (which is what its class is literally SUPPOSED TO DO) we are punished for it by not receiving armor back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very pretty, but if you're looking for interesting gameplay, look elsewhere.

The environments are very well designed and the graphics engine does an admirable job of bringing large hordes of enemies to life. The art team clearly loved this game and the wealth of visual inspiration found in the 40k universe makes for an environment that's consistently grimdark and occasionally breathtaking despite the dark, oppressive story beats.

However, the gameplay is too basic to remain entertaining for long. Melee is a one-button affair with a push-X-to-parry system that wants to draw comparisons to Arkham Knights but feels more like a ""push X to not die"" scene from a mid-2000s action game. You do not dictate the pace of combat and any aggression on your part is immediately punished with chip damage from ranged fire and minor foes on your flanks. That chip damage swiftly mounts into fatalities. You -must- parry and retaliate, exploiting the invulnerability allowed by the retaliation and execution animations to restore your armor, slowly wearing down swarms of foes at a pace that is simply out of character for Space Marines.

Guns are inaccurate unless you're aiming down sights, ammunition is sharply limited, and anything worth shooting is also either resilient enough to shrug off ranged fire or capable of blocking sniper rounds with a sword. If an ally engages an enemy you can pop off a few head shots to knock it into execution range, but for the most part you're better off wading into the melee horde yourself and tediously retaliating your way to victory.

The visual character customization is beautiful but harshly restricted and/or greedily monetized, the equipment specialization and character growth are slow and ineffectual until you get one of a the handful of major abilities scattered throughout a 25 level grind. Relics and other equipment make more of a difference visually than in combat effectiveness - an additional 10% damage doesn't take you from 6 heavy attacks to 5 to stun a warrior, but the max rank sword sure does look a little prettier than the starter sword.

To cap that all off, in multiplayer every player has to play as a different class - but you can't select your class and then queue into a team where you're not competing for that class spot. There's about a 1 in 3 chance that someone has already selected the class you want to play when you join a team, and you can't progress your class if you can't play it, so expect to have to leave and re-queue, sometimes multiple times in a row, in order to play a preferred class in multiplayer.

The final nail in the coffin, then, is that despite the shallowness of the gameplay and the general jank of the multiplayer system, this game is terribly short, confusingly lacking in content despite having so little depth. There are only six campaign missions, which have no replayability. The only other option for PvE are operations, but again, there are only six operations. This is a full-priced $60 game that you could finish in a day, that nonetheless expects you to grind out 48 mission completions with each class to unlock visual armor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I guess they werent watching what happened with Helldivers 2, because they did the exact same thing as what nearly killed HD2.
What is the purpose of nerfing good and fun player equipment and severely increasing enemy spawns and lethality, in a power fantasy PVE game.

I used to play on Difficulty 4 no problem, but after the latest update im struggling to finish a difficulty 3 mission with full yellow gear.

I really hope they walk back these changes and dont keep digging deeper, because as it stands, i wont be touching this game again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please realise that this is literally one of the only games I've been looking forward to for a very very long time. I was hoping of actually enjoying a game for the first time in months, just for everything I feared to manifest after more than just a few hours of gameplay. Initially I thought the game was phenomenal, the weighty thump of the bolters, the tearing viscera of chainswords, the diverse abilities and a 2010s storyline packed with an explosive finale. I finished the game on the 2nd highest difficult, as reccomended, and wanted to try out more gameplay.

So I decided to play outside of the story mode.

The highest difficulty, Ruthless, shows the true colors of this game. After breezing through the first three difficulties and getting my class to high level, more issues began to arise as I became more intent on progressing my weapons. That's when the most glaring problems began to show; the combat is incredibly clunky with parries and snapshots almost guaranteeing you will be hit by 2-3 other enemies if you take them. The enemies themselves are monotonous to fight against with less AI responsiveness than even Halo Reach had, a game 14 years old. There's only six operation missions in total that most of them range from tedious to straight out not fun (people know the agony of the Heldrake mission while playing as Assault/Vanguard/Bulwark). The assault fails in any degree of melee, despite being for its namesake an ""assaulting"" class to get into close combat, meanwhile the fully-ranged heavy's best weapon is its close range multi-melta. PvP is a mess with a TTK that feels either like I'm playing HLL/Squad but swaps to Halo Reach but everyone has armor lock in an instant. Trying to play the campaign again shows how much the story was the definition of a one-time experience with much of the plotholes and abandoned storylines showing far more glaringly on the second playthrough. Almost all the weaponry is borderline identical save for the melta which is the only usable weapon in high level Operations, of which you will probably be kicked if you aren't using a melta or playing Bulwark 60%%+ of the time. The lack of mechanical flow in the melee kills any degree of skill-based gameplay with even using core mechanics like parrying and snapshots working against you 90% of the time by opening yourself up to other attacks for a solid 1+ second. In melee you are entirely powerless against any more than 3-4 enemies even if its just gaunts or tzaangors. Of which, even the most minor of enemies take several shots/hits to even stagger them (again, unless you use a melta). Tack all of this onto a subpar overall multiplayer experience with three total maps, 60-90+ second load times on a current-gen PC, an AI that would barely function as a support chatbot on a corporate website, borderline unfair enemy spawns (neurothrope vs melee-centric teams), ranged enemies that you can't even see shooting through entire buildings and walls, and to cap it all off I can't even play as a custom or my favourite chapter without hearing them recite a voice line about Ultramar or the Guilliman every 15 seconds.

It feels like they were rushed to do the bare minimum to call it a ""complete"" game, but failed to do any quality testing beyond the initial gameplay mechanics. These are all things they can, and I hope certainly will, fix in a few weeks to months of patches, but if you want a complete list of changes I would suggest and that I've seen others propose, you can read them below.

- Add I-Frames to parry/snapshots like executions currently have
- Have melee regenerate small amounts of HP on kill or increase the current healing mechanic in melee dramatically as stimpacks are way too far and few between while having no real way of getting HP back
- Nerf the melta's HP regen while buffing ranged HP regen hit (You can go from 1-100% HP in a single shot of melta vs getting maybe 10-15% of your HP back with a bolter)
- Remove the stagger from the melta (I don't think anyone can argue that having a melta on Ruthless makes the game 10x easier when the enemies can't even swing back and hordes disappear in 1-2 shots)
- Increase practically all bolter damage to actually be a real bolter and annihilate soft targets in 1-2 shots
- Rework Operations Assault entirely - Copy/pasting the current PvP Assault mechanics onto Operations, make the hammer viable with faster swings/heavies, make the fist viable by doing massive single-target damage
- Add more boss-oriented Operations or alternative endings (the final boss fight in the campaign was 10/10 and the Hive Tyrant was pretty good as well)
- More melee weapons that actually feel different. A power axe for anti-elites, eviscerator for anti-horde, and so on.
- More hordes. There's too many times where I feel like I'm fighting a probing force rather than an entire hive invasion fleet.
- Make walls actually solid and ranged enemy attacks not go through them (pretty obvious)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When you can manage to join a game, the game is fantastic. However in the 40 hours of playtime I have, id say 35 of that has been waiting for load screens or the game bugging out.
Consistently need to wait 20 minutes for the game itself to load, and when joining online games its an 80% chance to bug out and im stuck with a black screen but can hear the barge etc. Needs patching BAD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saber, this is a fun game. Its a co-op shooter, where we are space marines and we are fit to lead our wildest fantasies for however we want. We are super humans that can tear through enemies and make them fear us.

I don't have time for 4000 hours to drop into this game as I got university and a job to upkeep. I play games to relax. This is not what I want outta SM2. Sure add another difficulty bar, make higher levels higher and more difficult, that is fine. This doesn't mean you should make the other lower levels harder just because you felt like it. This is not the way to make a good game, this makes people hate it.

Industry-wide people hate the everloving crap outta nerfs, especially in co-op PVE shooters. Helldivers 2 is an excellent example. They had extreme nerfs which caused people top recoil and despise it, only to return when Arrowhead released the mother of all buffs to win back player loyalty. And it worked, maybe not a whole lot, but its a step in the right direction and what you need to do as well.

Nerfs are never the answer, making a game increasingly punishing for casuals isn't either. This is your Helldivers moment, Saber, don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this up. Buff the space marines and you will win back the gamers. Otherwise, what await you are more bad reviews as this one. Don't go down this path, it never ends well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game is fun, great action, beautiful set pieces. But my god, this game has some serious bugs to work out. And they randomly seem to get worse.

Matchmaking is horrrrible.

I spend so much time just trying to get into a match and every step along the way the game is likely to give you an error after a long load screen. Sometimes immediately upon selecting match make it gives you loading screens and then times out, sometimes you're still in your own world and someone else tries to join you and times out. Sometimes you are trying to join someone else's match and long load screen and... times out.

Then, when you finally manage to join a match with other players, half the time you've both chosen the same class and one of you is forced to leave or change to another class that you may not have leveled up high enough to the difficulty you've already selected when choosing matchmaking, you now have to quit the matchmake or risk sabotaging the match for the other players because you dont have the right perks/weapons on this character to pull your own weight.

It's just a badly designed process. And this could at least be balanced out if the game was tuned in a way that you could actually manage things solo. But that's not possible with the garbage NPCs they give you for squadmates. Unless you're max level with max level guns, you're likely not going to be able to pull off even the first operations on easy difficulty.

So much of this game needs more time to cook. Look at the subreddit and you'll see posts like where you upgrade the same weapon and some of its stats go down. Why is that a thing? Not a variant weapon, but the same one has lower stats at a higher level. It's just nonsensical stuff.

I have yet to successfully close the game via the ingame menu without it freezing. Have to alt+f4 or force it to stop via steam. At the end of every mission I either get disconnected or sit through incredibly long load times as the game hangs, then disconnects me from the squad I was with.

Oh, and then the few times I've managed to get a really solid group together and are crushing a mission, 30+ minutes in, the game can hard crash where I'm then forced to reboot my PC and there is no option to rejoin squad mates. So not only do you not get to complete the mission, you get literally zero rewards from it. No XP per kill or per objective completed while you were in the mission. XP only comes at the end of the mission... Again, who in 2024 came up with these backwards ideas and terrible net code?

This game is ultimately just not End User friendly. It wastes your time. The entire time I've been writing this I've been stuck at the end of a mission load screen and am once again going to have to alt+f4. What a mess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Balancing is a big issue. Weapons are way to weak to be used in a Power Fantasy world. Recent updates show the Saber Devs did not hear the community and are taking the same path the Devs did with Helldivers2 and this will kill the community just like it did with Hellsdivers2. Nerfing weapons and grenades, parry, was not needed and the game is even less fun now. Still no way to regen health which is critical because Armour does not protect the character that much at all, so health regen is sorely missed from the first Space Marine game. Some (most) weapons like All Bolter weapons are specificly way to weak, in lore these are the main weapons for a Space Marine and they are not properly represented here at all ( add Plasma is not proper either ).

Still can not freely choose the class we want to play because the Devs limited the class to one of each per match ( So stupid to put limits on what class people can choose to play and to force them to change is unexceptable ). This is a huge problem for me as it just seems wrong to do this.

We have to go through 4 loadings screens before actually entering the game. All games need to just stop this, seriously. Then leaving a match there are several loading screen that also can not be skipped. So when you try to get into a match and you have to back out because someone else is playing the class you want to play as, you have a ton of loading screens to go through and then back through, just to try and get into a match. Hopefully you dont get disconnected from the frequent Server Disconnect errors this game has, which have been there since day 1 and Early Access.

I dont know why the Saber Devs want to follow in the footsteps of the Helldivers2 Devs but hey it is there game to kill. Oh well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bueno, juego frenÃ©tico, grÃ¡ficos bien logrados, combate muy bueno y muchas hordas que nos gusta, aunque se ve que fue diseÃ±ado primero pensando en consolas por lo falta de opciones grÃ¡ficas para poder castigar a tu GPU y exprimirle lo que tiene y lo que no tiene. Para un hiper fan de la franquicia pues te va a decir que es the best of the best pero no llega a eso, para un hater le va dar negativo porque simplemente es lo que es un hater o es un jugador que compra por impulso sin saber a lo que va o no es su tipo de juego y se agarrara de los pocos fallos que tiene el juego para hablar mal y darle negativo, como siempre pasa. El juego es bueno peeero con campaÃ±a muy corta 6-7 horas en normal, por lo que recomiendo jugar a dificultades mas altas si no quieren terminarlo antes de que pensaran que llevaban 1/3 del juego y resulta que es el final de la campaÃ±a, otra cosa que no me gusto es el uso excesivo de ascensores, no se si es para cargar los escenarios o el motor no aguanta tanto, por otro lado, los enemigos se repiten mucho por lo que terminas pasÃ¡ndolos muy fÃ¡cilmente por lo tanto que se repiten ya que te aprendes las mecÃ¡nicas. Tiene otros modos de juego que aumentan la jugabilidad como son las operaciones, me parece acertado y jugar en cooperativo es excelente, te sientes como un marine espacial jugando con tus amigos. en resumen recomendado pero ya sabes sus puntos fuertes y puntos dÃ©biles para poner en balanza si quieres invertir dinero en sus diferentes versiones o esperar que baje un poco de precio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Â¡AMIGOS DEL CAOS Y DE LO INEXPLICABLE! Hoy vengo a hablarles de una joya, una obra de arte hecha con metralla, mÃºsculos y absolutamente ninguna gota de piedad: Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2. Un juego que es como un mazazo en la cara, pero con amor. Porque claro, nada grita â€œamorâ€?como una armadura de tres toneladas aplastando a una horda de alienÃ­genas viscosos que gritan cosas que ni su madre entiende.

AquÃ­ encarnas a un Ultramarine, esos seÃ±ores vestidos como si fueran a una boda espacial pero, en lugar de regalar toallas o relojes, traen pura destrucciÃ³n. Â¡BOOM! Â¡PUM! Â¡CLANG! Vas por ahÃ­ soltando espadazos, disparos y comentarios filosÃ³ficos como: ""La muerte es la paz verdadera, pero mientras tanto... Â¡TOMA!"" La trama es lo de menos. Lo importante es: Â¿cuÃ¡ntos bichos puedes aplastar antes de que tu monitor te pida un descanso?

Visualmente es como una explosiÃ³n de fuegos artificiales lanzada por un orco con resaca. Colores oscuros, gritos, fuego, mÃ¡s fuego y explosiones que te hacen sentir como si estuvieras dentro de una olla de presiÃ³n, pero con estilo. Â¿Los grÃ¡ficos? Impresionantes. Cada gota de sangre alienÃ­gena tiene la delicadeza de un pintor renacentista en Ã¡cido.

El combate es pura brutalidad, cada golpe se siente en la mÃ©dula. Â¡Y los enemigos! Bueno, son como los mosquitos en verano: nunca se acaban, y por cada uno que matas, aparece otro peor.

ConclusiÃ³n: Si alguna vez te preguntaste cÃ³mo serÃ­a ser un gigante de metal con la sutilidad de una apisonadora, este juego te lo responderÃ¡. Y si no te lo preguntaste, tambiÃ©n te da igual, porque lo vas a disfrutar igual de todas formas. Es brutal, es Ã©pico y no tiene ni un segundo de descanso.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPACE MARINE 2 REVIEW

Meu GOTY de 2024

Jogo de homem, testosterona pura, feito para quem Ã© fÃ£ de Warhammer. Vai tirar lÃ¡grimas dos teus olhos, finalmente chegamos no AAA e merecemos esse lugar.

Combate rÃ¡pido e responsivo, gore Ã  mostra, te dÃ¡ um feeling de ser um Super Soldado. Se vocÃª quer o aspecto de power fantasy, jogue no mais fÃ¡cil, porque nas duas Ãºltimas dificuldades o Titus Ã© feito de papel, e vocÃª tem que ser inteligente e ver o combate como algo mais tÃ¡tico.

As armas de combate corpo a corpo sÃ£o extremamente fortes, o que faz com que os vÃ¡rios bolters do jogo sejam armas de suporte. O Martelo Ã© a Ãºltima arma de combate corpo a corpo a ser desbloqueada e Ã© fantÃ¡stica para lidar com qualquer inimigo, atÃ© mesmo os chefÃµes que estarÃ£o no seu caminho. Como era no primeiro jogo, carregar uma arma de dano alto, como uma sniper, e o martelÃ£o pro resto.

Diferente do primeiro jogo, a ""Rage"" do Titus nÃ£o te ajuda muito, pelo menos nas dificuldades mais altas. Usar a Rage no meio de um monte de inimigos nÃ£o vai te curar nada, vocÃª tem que ter visÃ£o de quando usÃ¡-la para poder encher sua barra de vida. O jogo conta com dois sistemas de vida: o HP, que sÃ³ pode ser curado com a Rage e os Medpacks espalhados pelo mapa (no mÃ¡ximo, vocÃª vai achar 4 por nÃ­vel, e eles nem recuperam a vida toda, recuperam cerca de 40% da sua vida total), e a Armadura, que vai ser sua real vida, sendo recuperada com o tempo ou com execuÃ§Ãµes nos inimigos. Raramente vocÃª vai executar um inimigo fraco, isso se reserva aos Elites. O jogo se torna um samba onde vocÃª mata centenas de mobs bÃ¡sicos enquanto foca em colocar o elite em um estado de execuÃ§Ã£o para se manter vivo dentro do combate.

Posicionamento Ã© mestre tanto contra os quanto contra os , mas as hordas insetoides oferecem um desafio muito maior do que os . Esses insetos malditos vÃ£o te cercar tanto de perto quanto de longe, com granadas que obstruem seu caminho e pragas que vÃ£o deixar sua visÃ£o turva. JÃ¡ os feiticeiros sÃ£o mestres em combate de longo alcance, mas os Marines nÃ£o sÃ£o tÃ£o perigosos quanto os cultistas com rifles snipers, que juntos destroem sua vida e me colocaram no chÃ£o vÃ¡rias vezes.

Cutscenes lindas, histÃ³ria bÃ¡sica, mas que invoca tudo o que Warhammer representa com os Ultramarines, Anjos do ImpÃ©rio do Homem, que chegam na hora em que o ImpÃ©rio mais precisa para salvar o dia.

Mesmo eu nÃ£o sendo fÃ£ dos Ultramarines, , eu gostei muito da caracterizaÃ§Ã£o deles. ParabÃ©ns Ã  Saber.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 is an exhilarating, action-packed sequel that takes everything great from the first game and cranks it up. The intense combat feels fluid and satisfying, with epic battles against swarms of enemies that really capture the scale and ferocity of the Warhammer 40k universe. On top of that, the game runs smoothly with excellent performance, even during the most chaotic fights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Short Version:
Visually beautiful game, fun gameplay, good amount of variety in classes, few bugs, lots of re-playability, Co-Op PvP and PvE, beloved lore and well loved franchise.


Long Version:

Space Marines 2 is a sci-fi and gothic dark fantasy with biblical motifs that make Warhammer 40k awesome. The sheer and immense sense of scale, both indoors and outdoors perfectly capture the depth of the world that is Warhammer.

You can feel the immense love for the lore and source material, it's definitely made by fans who genuinely care about this world that is imbued through the visuals and attention to detail in every facet and asset.

This is every Warhammer 40k fan's wet dream.


Pros:
â€?Impressive visuals with lore-accurate art direction. The brutality and bleakness of the 40K universe are masterfully conveyed
â€?Superb combat system that equally rewards skill, resource conservation and a tactical, team-oriented approach. Very easy to pick up and get better. Pacing is done very well
â€?Solid variety of enemies, all of which have unique behaviors, movesets and abilities
â€?Bosses that evolve their movesets dynamically, and are highly challenging on the harder settings
â€?The 40K lore is accurately transposed and faithful to the series canon
â€?Enjoyable, well-written storyline, compounded by plausible characters and interesting events
â€?Exploration and Customization are rewarded
â€?DLC's are purely cosmetic, all future content is already planned ahead of time and content is free


Cons:
â€?AI companions arenâ€™t smart enough for complex objectives, and canâ€™t be ordered around or customized
â€?Balancing issues make some weapons redundant or useless
â€?Tabbing out of the game at any point causes the game to freeze, and I'm rocking a pretty solid set up



Writing/Lore/Worldbuilding

â€œIn the grim darkness of the far future, there is only warâ€? A historical quote that single-handedly resumes the bleak, brutal universe of 40K; Humanity spans the stars, its society on the verge of collapse and only carried by a fanatically-rooted war economy. SM1â€™s protagonist, Titus, returns as the main character and is sent on a mission to defend the Imperium; this time around, insect-like Tyranids and the Ruinous Powers of Chaos.

The tale of Titus and his two Ultramarine companions is lore-accurate and engaging â€?40K fans will catch many references and bits a newcomer wouldnâ€™t, but that doesnâ€™t make it un-enjoyable if youâ€™re new to the franchise. Characters arenâ€™t one-sided and have solid narrative depth; the feeling of being an important cog of the Imperial war machine â€?but a cog nonetheless â€?is conveyed perfectly, as it should be.

Visually and artistically, few games can equal the desolate beauty the game has to offer. From the enormous Tyranid swarms laying waste to all, to the iridescent distortions of Warp powers and the blasts of Cadian artillery, everything looks and sounds amazingly crisp. Settings are varied and rich in detail, with more than a few impressive landscapes. Weapon sounds, dense effects and excellent voice acting only give further emphasis to the action-packed battles youâ€™ll engage in. The gory finisher animations, different based on the enemy faced and weapon used, add great emphasis to the destruction of tougher foes.


Exploration & Secrets

Maps are linear, with one path to follow once either all foes are slain, or certain objectives are completed. Still, exploring the few side-areas, nothing more than crevices or branching dead-ended paths, is worth your time. There, youâ€™ll find precious supplies and uncommon weapons that will improve your survival chances: medkits, Relics allowing you to revive once, heavy weapons and ammunition caches. Lore-related Dataslates also can be listened to in order to better understand the events that transpired. There are no collectibles or proper secrets to mention, nor a map, which you wonâ€™t need given the fairly-simple layouts and on-demand objective markers.


Operations (PVE) and Endless War (PVP)

After the Campaign, youâ€™ll unlock several Operations: PvE missions parallel to the main story that depict critical events and feature another Ultramarine team that helped Titus in the main story. Contrary to the campaign, here you'll have access to six customizable classes, each with unique loadout capabilities and Ultimate skills, other than different passive perks and weapons to unlock as you gain XP after an Operation is cleared. Experimenting with different playstyles and combinations, and upgrading your class, adds solid replay value and good progression feeling. These Operations also have progressively increasing difficulty, with better rewards, such as cosmetics, XP bonuses and so forth, proportional to the difficulty youâ€™ll engage into â€?however, you won't go far in the harder difficulties without better gear and advanced perks, despite all of the settings being available from the start regardless of level.


Content & Replay Value

Average playtime is around 16 hours to complete the game on Angel of Death (hardest) difficulty with two AI teammates, taking extra time to explore all locations thoroughly. After that, Operations and PvP modes greatly extend the content with their high replay value. The story is instead linear, and thereâ€™s no reason to replay it except achievements.

The PvP mode, Endless War, has Chaos forces face the Space Marines in a variety of objective-based modes, ranging from the classic Deathmatch and CTF to more nuanced ones. It allows full loadout customizations just as in the PvE mode, and is a nice addition for those interested in competing against other players to test their skills.



Conclusion:

Do I recommend it? Absolutely. Even if youâ€™re not a 40K fan and just enjoy action games, this is a solid pick. Even better if you have two friends to tag along; the best experience is in co-op.

One of the best WH40K games ever made. Not only it surpasses its predecessor on all fronts, but also sets a point of reference for modern co-op-focused action titles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From PVE standpoint, the game is overall fun... except a few thing just ruin the entire game.
A single ranged unit should not be able to spam the entire field with no cooldown with a slowing, damaging, blind debuffing aoe's without any limit. Who thought this was a good idea when they spawn in multiple almost all the time? Range units are still and always will be a unbalanced mess in this game since they will always have free damage against you at any given time since you can't block or counter them except for 2 specific classes, and the infinite green sacks of poop is just crossing the line.
Zoanthropes Zoanthropes Zoanthropes. You dont have krak grenades? You dont have a sniper? You just spent 15 minutes without a single ammo cache or drops and now you have to melee these things that literally makes it impossible to do anything except dodge constantly since two of them stagger unparryable AOE attacks... except oh wait, they are flying 100% of the time and you can't melee them. I guess I will just quit mission cause the game just threw not one but two unfair enemies that alternate invincibility just because. Just pure design fail. Did I mention they also buff all enemies around them on top of everything I just mentioned? At least Neurothrope is fair and actually has sensible mechanic to kill them with melee. Players should be able to actually overcome all enemies without relying on pure RNG to even have a fair chance to progress at all. Especially when majority of the classes is heavily focused on melee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brothers! This is the game we have been waiting for. Visually itâ€™s gorgeous and seeing the universe we know and love (and sometimes hate) realized on screen feels so good.

Itâ€™s important to note that this game is not Darktide and it is most definitely not Helldivers. For some reason thatâ€™s rhetoric that kept being parroted before release.

The combat itself feels incredible and is insanely fun. I thought it felt clunky at first , but once I understood the mechanics- it clicked. This really does feel like a true return to what gaming was in the 2006-2013 era and what I wish we saw more of today.

A tight , fun campaign and not too long with the ability to play through it in co-op. Co-op exclusive missions. Straight forward PvP with a progression system that unlocks cosmetics by playing the game and weapon skills unlocked by X number of victories.

Chaos definitely got shafted in the customization since all they can do is change colors while Loyalists can mix and match different armor sets. I hope to see them expand on that as the game grows.

Itâ€™s had a successful launch, even from early access. Can be played offline, performs well and have barely come across any bugs. As a long time Warhammer fanâ€¦this game is everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted. Now we just need a Sororitas video game to matchâ€?

You would think that watching the fall of Helldivers 2 would teach any game developer a lesson: We don't want ball-crushing torture gameplay. The game already suffered from a lack of ammunition in some areas leaving people to skip flying mobs. I just watched a streamer take half an hour to punch 2 zoanthropes and a neurothrope to death on Bulwark in Lethal difficulty because for some messed up reason Terminus enemies now lock you into your current zone.

Truly 9/10 game.

Pros;
+ Excellent atmosphere, both visually and soundwise
+ Great plotline
+ Bossfights are somewhat fun
+ Combat is enjoyable

Cons;
- Too few glory kills. It becomes dull after some time.
- Some weapons are useless
- I'd preferred Horde mode integrated from the initial release, instead of PvP. PvP does not entice me. This is a personal thing ofc

So what are you waiting for to play?

Loved this game at launch. I'm not a hardcore player, just casual, but this latest patch is just a huge step in the wrong direction. Total Helldivers 2 move. Honestly this game was tough as is, I enjoyed playing this game solo and now it's that much harder and nerfing the dodge rolling feels awful. I'm just trying to play this game to have fun not to struggle through everything. Add the tougher difficulty first, then try some other things. Don't take the fun out of the game. Make it tougher with increased difficulty not with nerfing things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patch 4.1 is a definite improvement over the previous one and is a good step in the right direction. I think they should still vastly improve melee as a whole and buffs the bolters more but i'm glad they listened to feedback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fans waited 13 years for this but incredibly, the game makes you feel like the wait was worth it.
Space Marine 2 is few in flaws and has plentiful amounts of awesome sections and details. The gameplay in Campaign and Operations feels very smooth and highly responsive. Control inputs won't force you to lock into an animation while fighting, so you can be swinging a melee combo one moment and in the middle of that press key to parry an enemy, and the animation will snap smoothly to parrying from what you were doing earlier.
Visually game is very impressive as well! I only spotted one pop-in in 18 hours and one model missing in Battle Barge (which was fixed by forcing a reload of environments). Some of the architecture in Battle Barge and Hive City is up to par when compared to what we got in Space Marine 1 and it was also stunning sometimes to walk around and admire the scenery developers had come up with.
Voice acting is perfect! It took me a few moments to get used to Titus' voice but it wasn't long when I was able to identify Chairon and Gadriel also while fighting Tyranids.
From acting I should move on to writing: as a lore nerd I found this game to be a great representation of canon lore, I felt a sense of brotherhood with Chairon and Gadriel, some dialogue made me genuinely laugh out loud and the final boss had couple of line deliveries that really worked for me (""pearls of wisdom"" bit etc.).
All in all, one of the best sequels I've played and definitely lived up to fan expectations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

le jeu a un tres gros potentiel bien sure tout les fan-boys de la licence seront plus que ravi !
sont plus gros point fort est sans contest sont gameplay !
Pour moi c'est un bon jeu mais pas a ce prix la ( a sa sortie)
une campagne des plus classic voire meme old school ce qui peu etre un parti-pris ! mais apres je trouve que certains points nÃ©gatifs ressorte a mon avis
- les maps PVP franchement tres banals tres fades sans interets pour moi
c'est un jeu qui aurait meriter de s'inspirer de ce qui se fait de mieux dans sont genre une bonne dose d'inluence a la overwatch aurait Ã©tÃ© je pense un bon moove
- le PVE quand a lui a sa sortie a par une campagne d'une douzaine d'heure et d un mode operation avec seulement 6 cartes qui reprennent les carte de la campagne c'est vraiment tres tres tres leger je trouve !!
au regard de la licence et de l'inepuisable lor on pourrait clerement et objectivement s'attendre a mieux
car oui certain try-hardeur en quelques heures ont deja poncÃ©s tout le contenu ( co-op compris )
c'est un jeu au vu de sa richese ou on aurait pu s 'attendre a des maps ouvertes avec vehicules ect un peu a la destiny !
bref il y aurait encore tant a dire
esce que je conseil ce jeu OUI mais attendez une baisse de prix ou que le contenu soit fortement ettoffÃ© je doute que vous surviviez et moi le premier a plus d'une centaine d'heure a son contenu actuel sans passÃ© a autre chose une fois que vous aurez debloquÃ© 60 % du jeu le rÃ©pÃ©titivitÃ© et la rejouabilitÃ© auront raison de vous rapidement !
un bon jeu qui vaut le coup a moins de 30 euros dans sont Ã©tat actuel donc si il vous interesse attendez un peu pour toutes les raisons citÃ© plus haut sinon si vous Ã©tes fan-boys et que la rÃ©pÃ©titivitÃ© et son manque de contenu ne vous gene pas sautez dessus
pour moi un bon 13/20 lui va bien pour le moment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think there are a lot of fun aspects to the game, but overall it's incredibly barebones for a 60$ title. There aren't really a whole lot of weapon choices, the coop has like 8 missions to play (30-60 minutes each), and the story was decent I guess. I feel like that comparing this to other Warhammer games makes this feel like a masterpiece (almost all of them I have played have been bad), but standalone it's rather middleground or underperforming in many areas. This is like the first time I paid 60$ for a game in years, visually appealing game then this may be for you. Or if you are just a major Warhammer fan then this is a step in the right direction for the quality of this type of game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game captures the vibes of 40k universe with incredible love for detail. The campaign was badass, but sadly rather short (~6 hours). Co-op is fun from easiest difficulty to stomp enemy swarms and a learning curve to master the highest difficulty levels.

Oyun gÃ¶rsel ve fizik olarak oldukÃ§a gÃ¼zel ve tatmin edici ama her oyunun yanÄ±nda getirdiÄŸi ""negatif"" yÃ¶nler bu oyunda da mevcut ve ben bu ""negatif"" yÃ¶nlere aldÄ±rÄ±ÅŸ eden birisi deÄŸilim oynarÄ±m ve keyif alÄ±rÄ±m.

Kendimce negatif yÃ¶nler:
-2 kiÅŸiyken operasyona girmeye Ã§alÄ±ÅŸtÄ±ÄŸÄ±nÄ±z zaman yanÄ±nÄ±za bot veriyor, lobi sahibiyken girerseniz yanÄ±nÄ±za 2 bot veriyor.
Belki ayarlarÄ±mdan online kapalÄ±dÄ±r veya odam sadece arkadaÅŸlar iÃ§indir diye dÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼nÃ¼p ayarlara baktÄ±ÄŸÄ±mda Ã¶yle bir ayar bulamadÄ±m.

-OynadÄ±ÄŸÄ±nÄ±z sÄ±nÄ±f ne olursa olsun otomatik eÅŸleÅŸtiÄŸiniz zaman bir anda istemediÄŸiniz bir sÄ±nÄ±fÄ± oynuyor bulabilirsiniz kendinizi.Bunu umarÄ±m deÄŸiÅŸtirirler ben bulwark oynuyorsam veya seÃ§tiysem beni bulwarkÄ±n olmadÄ±ÄŸÄ± bir lobiye atsÄ±n ben boÅŸuna seÃ§medim class'Ä± sonuÃ§ta.

-Operasyon modunun zorluÄŸu:Operasyon modlarÄ±nÄ±n zorluklarÄ± ciddi dÃ¼zeyde artÄ±yor orta seviyeden sonra Ã¶zellikle hissediyorsunuz oyunun zor olduÄŸunu buna nazaran karakterinizin direncine dair herhangi bir artÄ±ÅŸ sÃ¶z konusu deÄŸil.Silah upgradeleri gibi Armor upgradeleri de olsaydÄ± dedim kendi iÃ§imden oyunu oynarken, hatta direkt silah mekaniÄŸinin aynÄ±sÄ±nÄ± armor iÃ§in uygulayabilirlerdi daha gÃ¼Ã§lÃ¼ armor daha gÃ¼zel kozmetik aÃ§Ä±lÄ±ÅŸÄ± daha saÄŸlÄ±klÄ± olurdu bence.

-Operasyon modu inanÄ±lmaz az ama oyun yeni Ã§Ä±ktÄ±ÄŸÄ± iÃ§in Ã§ok Ã¼stÃ¼nde durmayacaÄŸÄ±m umarÄ±m ilerde daha fazla mapler gelir ve Ã§eÅŸitlilik olur.

-YaratÄ±klarÄ± Ã¶ldÃ¼rdÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼mÃ¼z zaman Ã¼zerimize sÄ±Ã§rayan kanlar keÅŸke hep Ã¼zerimizde kalsa zamanla gitmemelerini isterdim en azÄ±ndan heal kullandÄ±ÄŸÄ±mÄ±z zaman kanlar temizlense Ã§ok daha gÃ¼zel olurdu Ã§Ã¼nkÃ¼ kan iÃ§inde olan zÄ±rhÄ±mÄ±z azÄ±cÄ±k sakinlikle parlamaya baÅŸlÄ±yor tekrar ve o kÄ±smÄ± Ã§ok beÄŸenmedim umarÄ±m dikkat ederler o noktaya.

Bu saydÄ±klarÄ±m kesinlikle Ã§Ã¶zÃ¼lebilecek ve bÃ¼yÃ¼k olmayan sorunlar onun dÄ±ÅŸÄ±nda oyun son derece keyifli,akÄ±cÄ± ve vahÅŸi.Ä°yi oyunlar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kebinds for keybord are not great. its reccomended that this is played with a conrtoller. melee combat is not great. the agro on the player in solo campain is rediclous. but my lord the Attention to detail is perfect. Gunplay is satifsfying. & the voice acting is top notch. The melee combat could use some love ""no block at all"" only parry. but thats really all the game needs to be perfect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 is a game that is far, far better than Space Marine.

The entire theatre is much more ""alive"" than before, very often you will fight side by side with the guard, see wonderfully made models of tanks and listen to rousing speeches by devout soldiers of the Emperor.
The atmosphere is top notch, how everything sounds too and executes look nice again.

The campaign is very well done and fun to play, with GREAT surprises and events that are really cool.
Seeing the swarms of Tyranids on the screen is astonishing.

There is a problem with playing the campaign solo tho.
It is entirely possible to play the campaign on Veteran, solo, but for a first time playthrough i highly recommend against it.

I assume they balanced the Veteran campaign around at least 2 humans playing, which is tremendous fun for sure,
but solo quite some things are not difficult, just frustratingly stupid because the AI is very limited.
I can imagine double Zoanthropes are much less of a hassle, even on vet, with at least 2 ""real"" players.
The ranged damage received is through the roof too, which could be a numbers problem,
or because the ai has such poor target priority.

I have a Keyboard issue where my current input is being shut off randomly.
It happens when i walk/run or zoom in to aim. The character stops in his tracks / no longer zooms in until i press the button again and its making it very difficult to enjoy the game. It happens during fights, it happens when i have to walk somewhere.

Its NOT my keyboard, it works perfectly fine with other games, including Space Marine which i re-played tuesday and wednesday. Its only this game.


If you like 40k, Space Marines and good action buy this game and if you are on the fence about it, maybe wait for the first sale.
I just finished my first coop-mission and its really cool, but i dont want to subject myself and other players to the problems with my controls so i will wait until its fixed/i find a fix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have extreme bipolar feeling about this game.Despite the fact that the champion is short and ordinary, as a fan of Warhammer franchise I did enjoyed it greatly. As I finished the champion in 7 hour and started to play the operation mode, the game first startled me with the merely 6 map. After that, I discovered that the time needed to upgrade the character and weapons are enormous. I am wondering how Saber Interactive expects players to enjoy the operation; by repetitively farming the same map over and over for hundreds of times? Not to mention finishing one map costs about half an hour. I am not even gonna talk about the absurdity of some of the game design as many have pointed out in depth.
Overall, the champion is great but the rest is straight up â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. I highly suggest you guys to wait for the game to actually finish and go on sale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

30th of October review update
The game is headed in a direction I don't like. Ruthless difficulty is just not enjoyable anymore. Your space marine gets a lot less armor than in lower difficulties, while enemies just become bullet sponges. Your health pool is gated at the bottom of it, so when you have a lot of it it goes down fast, once you have fewer health bars remaining it goes down slower. It's like most of your health is concentrated in the bottom part of it. Makes no sense.

Enemies do a lot more damage in the higher difficulties, so much so that it feels unfairly punishing.

Playing against chaos is still a bad experience overall compared to Tyranids. And I don't even feel like touching Lethal difficulty with the game in its current state.

Player numbers are also dwindling down, going as low as 22 thousands concurrently playing tonight. I think the game is already on the way to die, with less than 2 months since its release.

They should have used difficulty 3 enemies health and damage values across all difficulties, and just change the number and type of enemies based on difficulties, like Helldivers 2 does. They have the swarm engine which can show you hundreds of enemies on screen and they barely use its capabilities





All I'm going to say about this most recent update is that whoever developed and approved the cohesion cringe mechanic for the new Lethal difficulty needs to be fired.

Plus, this update as a whole makes me want to uninstall the game, after playing for almost 300 hours total and every single day since its release. Feels like Helldivers 2 all over again!

I'm getting PTSD just writing this




With the latest patch, the game is definitely heading in the right direction and feels much better to play. Itâ€™s a lot of fun, and I can now confidently recommend it. As long as future updates keep improving things and don't cause any setbacks, this is shaping up to be something really great, and it already is.

It's almost unbelievable in 2024 to see a development team thatâ€™s so competent, knows what they're doing, and can deliver a solid update for their game right from the get-go

The only downside after the latest update is the persistent stuttering, which wasnâ€™t an issue before

The stuttering has been fixed with a hotfix




I've experienced my PC hard freezing twice - once after the prologue mission and another time while attempting to close the game, which forced me to restart my computer. However, since the latest hotfix, I haven't encountered any further issues like this.

For reference, I'm running an AMD Radeon RX 6800 and an i9-10900KF.


Matchmaking in operations is bugged; often, it simply doesnâ€™t work. On top of that, difficulty level 4 operations are frustratingly hard, reminiscent of the problems that have plagued

Here are some specific issues Iâ€™ve noticed. These are strictly regarding PvE Operations mode, especially at the highest difficulty 4:


1. it's one of the main reasons the game feels so frustratingly difficult.

2a. : Timing a parry feels unreliable, although it gets better once you get more used to it.
2b: The shield block doesnâ€™t block all blue attacks, which doesnâ€™t make sense to me.

3. You're always scraping for ammo, which feels excessive.

4. Enemies feel like bullet sponges. It takes a lot of melee strikes and ranged shots to bring down medium and heavy enemies (not including bosses, which are mostly fine). Even small units, especially the Chaos ones with shields, are way too tanky.

5. Just 2-3 hits from medium or heavy enemies will bring you down. With the weaker classes you can die instantly even when at full health.
Your armor feels like paper, and youâ€™re constantly running out of it.

6. Chaos is much more frustrating to fight than Tyranids, though Tyranids arenâ€™t much better.

7. Some classes are much more effective than others, with the Assault class being one of the weakest.

8a. Difficulty 4 is necessary to unlock the highest tier weapons, so you're forced to play at that difficulty sooner or later.
8b. A lot of these issues would be solved if weapon progression wasnâ€™t locked behind higher difficulties. Let the hardcore players push through difficulty 4 and above while allowing more casual players to enjoy the game on difficulty 2/3, even if unlocking weapon tiers takes longer.


As a result, a lot of players end up avoiding combat altogether and rushing straight for the final boss/encounter. But if you're avoiding combat in a game like what's the point?

The game desperately needs better balancing, and an FOV slider on top of that. One of Saber developers mentioned that itâ€™s fine for players to feel overpowered in PvE, but not in PvP. Well, as it stands, we actually feel in operations. Even the campaign, on difficulty level 4 is easier, much more fun, and overall more enjoyable.

Speaking of the campaign - itâ€™s one of the best Iâ€™ve ever played. So there's that, at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the Emperor Wills It.

The Good
Just like Hive Fleet Leviathan itself, too numerous to mention them all, so some choice selections:
A campaign that gives a certain someone the redemption they deserve. With some great set pieces and scenes that make you laugh in the grimdark, it is so over-the-top-its-good, as Warhammer should be.
When you're in the thick of it, combat feels extremely satisfying. It rewards perfect plays and brutally punishes mistakes, as it should. Difficulty scales fairly well, but mastering the tools available to you - and knowing your place in the machine - should secure victory even in the most dire circumstance.


As heretical as it may be...




On balance, one to pick up - especially given their road map plans - but at risk of dying early if care isn't applied appropriately. Currently, a lot of fun but I can't see it having the longevity and community love long term that SM1 did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The campaign is short, but it was some of the most satisfying gaming I have ever experienced. I've been a gamer for around 40 years. I love the Warhammer 40K universe and eveything was well done and true to the 40K lore. The music, sound effects, visuals, and even colors are all done well.

Ich hatte keine Systemprobleme, Ruckler oder Temperatur Probleme im Spiel.
Die Kampagne hatte ich in ca. 10 Stunden durch. Solide, spannend und als Quereinsteiger richt packend.
Der Normale Modus war fÃ¼r mich streckenweise Anspruchsvoll und wenn kein Bock auf Story hat oder lockerer genieÃŸen mÃ¶chte sollte auf leicht spielen.
In der Kampagne lernt man nicht nur die ganzen Kombos sondern auch die Waffen der spÃ¤teren Klassen kennen.
Die Grafik finde ich, sofern man sich mal im Warhammer Universum umschaut, passend.
Der Start und Download waren pÃ¼nktlich und ist Reibungslos abgelaufen.

Ich freue mich jetzt meinen Marine zu pimpen und mit anderen zu zocken.

Brachial, maskulin, aufregend. Ich liebe es.

Einige bÃ¶se Zungen wÃ¼rden das Spiel als einen Ausdruck toxischer MÃ¤nnlichkeit bezeichnen. Ich wÃ¼rde eher sagen, es ist genau dass, was die westliche Spiele- und Filmindustrie braucht.

Da ich bisher lediglich die Kampagne spiele, beziehe ich mich auch nur auf diese.
Space Marine 2 bietet Action und Gemetzel im Ãœberfluss. Wer SpaÃŸ an Hack&Slay hat, wird dieses Spiel lieben.
Das Gameplay in der Kampagne ist ansprechend und herausfordernd. Die Steuerung per Maus, oder Gamepad funktioniert tadellos und es wird nie langweilig seine Feinde in wunderschÃ¶ner Grafik zu zerstÃ¼ckeln.
Leider muss man sagen das es noch ein paar technische MÃ¤ngel gibt. Zum Beispiel stÃ¼rzt das Game bei mir immer ab, wenn ich es beenden mÃ¶chte.
Ebenso fehlt eine manuell Speicherfunktion. Das Spiel speichert leider nur automatisch, an bestimmten Checkpoints.
Ebenso das fehlen einer 21:9 oder 32:9 UnterstÃ¼tzung, verhindert eine noch hÃ¶here Bewertung meinerseits.
Doch wer Ã¼ber diese MÃ¤ngel hinwegsehen kann, bekommt ein wirklich gutes Action Game, welches richtig Laune macht.
Daher wÃ¼rde ich zur Zeit eine 7.5/10 geben.
Alles in allen wÃ¼rde ich mir mehr Spiele dieser Art wÃ¼nschen. Spiele in denen der Focus auf den SpaÃŸ am Spiel liegt und nicht nur auf dem abarbeiten einer ESG Checkliste.


Some evil tongues would describe the game as an expression of toxic masculinity. I'd rather say it's exactly what the western gaming and film industry needs.

Since I've only played the campaign so far, I'll only refer to this one.
Space Marine 2 offers action and carnage in abundance. Anyone who enjoys hack & slay will love this game.
The gameplay in the campaign is engaging and challenging. The control via mouse or gamepad works perfectly and it never gets boring to dismember your enemies in beautiful graphics.
Unfortunately, it has to be said that there are still a few technical deficiencies. For example, the game always crashes for me when I want to quit it.
There is also no manual saving function. Unfortunately, the game only saves automatically at certain checkpoints.
The lack of 21:9 or 32:9 support also prevents me from giving it an even higher rating.
But if you can overlook these shortcomings, you get a really good action game that really puts you in a good mood.
Therefore I would currently give it a 7.5/10.
All in all, I would like to see more games like this. Games in which the focus is on the fun of the game and not just on completing an ESG checklist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Awesome game.

After the last patch not playable for people with ultrawide-monitors (like me with 32:9) due to the missing FOV option.
I am getting motion sickness due to high zoom, the cutscenes are ridiculus with everyones face cut off above the forehead and you cannot see anything in fights!

This game is gorgeous, the campaign is super fun, everything seems very true to the 40k lore (if you care about that at all).

But anything having to do with online sucks in this game. Disconnects, randomly going into offline mode, server problems, etc. Oh and the black loading screens which will dominate a lot of your playtime.

There has never been a more apt use of the phrase, ""A shiny turd.""

I'll definitely give this a thumbs up if they can fix the server issues.

(Edit 10/26/2024) After the 4.0 patch I can no longer launch the game. It tried to connect to Epic and failed, and after uninstalling and reinstalling it refuses to launch. Avoid this game at all costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- Fantastic gameplay, the moment to moment action is super satisfying.
- Good story, played the main story in co-op mode with a friend, we had a wonderful time.
- A lot of potential, I've yet to try Operations and Pvp, but I can imagine them being a good time and looking forward to future updates and more!

""It is the 21st Century. For more than a hundred centuries The Skibidi has sat immobile in the Golden Toilet of Ohio. He is the Sigma of Mankind by the will of the chads, and master of a million discord servers by the might of his inexhaustible incels. He is a rotting meme looksmaxxing invisibly with power from the woke age of betas. He is the Meme Lord of the uncs for whom a thousand memes are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.

Yet even in bluds deathless state, the Skibidi continues his eternal edging. Mighty memes cross the brain-rotted miasma of the internet, the only route between goon caves, their way lit by Reddit, the psychic manifestation of the Skibidis will. Vast gooners give climax in his name on uncircumsied phalluses. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Og's, the Giga Chads, the bio-engineered super-gooners. Their comrades in arms are jelkers: the shadow wizard money gang and countless keyboard warriors, the ever violent climaxing and the game devs of Epic Games to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from blizzard entertainment, sussy imposters, john pork- and worse.

To be a white boy busting it down sexual style goated with the sauce in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most zesty TikTok rizz party imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of chungus and ugandan knuckles, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-edged. Forget the promise of butthole waxing and shartmaxxing, for in the grim dark future there is social credit. There is no rizzing amongst the gyatt's, only an eternity of fanum tax and Livvie Dunn, and the laughter of brain rotted npc""s.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unapologetic. Linear. Old School. Gory.

""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2"" feels like a breath of fresh air in todayâ€™s gaming landscape, crafted by skilled artists and developers who clearly understand the communityâ€™s hunger for an unfiltered, raw gaming experience. This game is a love letter to fans, unapologetically delivering a brutal, power-fantasy experience that stands in stark contrast to the tired formulas of modern AAA titles.

In an era plagued by bloated open-worlds, tedious ""complex"" characters, and invasive microtransactions, SM2 stays true to its roots. The result? A fully immersive journey that strips away the unnecessary and focuses on the essentials: visceral combat, duty, discipline, courage, and brotherhood. If you played the first Space Marine, you'll instantly connect with the tone and spirit of this sequelâ€”it's all about men who get the job done, no matter the odds. It is obvious that the setting is taken seriously, and nothing seems out of place, the protagonists BELONG, they are not forced in.

Even though the co-op and campaign content might seem light in comparison to other games, the sheer fun and intensity of the gameplay more than make up for it. And while it's not the biggest game out there, every moment of SM2 is crafted with precision and care.

Whether youâ€™re playing with friends, strangers, or even bots, the experience is consistently thrilling. Kudos to the developers at Saber Interactive for pulling this off in today's gaming climate, and a special thanks to the publishers for respecting the creative vision.

10/10â€”an absolute blast from start to finish. Itâ€™s a simple, satisfying story told through relentless action. This game isn't just entertainment; itâ€™s therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An essential play for the Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine fan. This Unreal Engine 5 game is graphically spectacular, capturing the world of 40K in healthy detail - For the Ultramarine chapter fan/player (of which, I know exist out there; disregard all those who speak with ridicule ;] ), there is a certain character who appears here, of which I shall not spoil. You'll have to play the game. Seeing this sort of thing, only leaves me wanting for more.

I actually look forward to more from this studio in the same franchise, now that we've gotten the game. They are literally the developers who can bring new fresh & worthy Space Marine expansion content into this particular format of game, ever since the old Relic Entertainment crew folded. Space Marine 2 lives.

FOR THE EMPEROR

Brutal fights, parry system, counter system, solid movement and shooting mechanics, cool armor.

Will add more as I progress.

NPC Is 60-70% useful. They deal satisfying damage and contributed to battle. Shame we cannot command them to focus on a specific annoying target.

Some familiar elements from another game:
+Almost similar to Gears of War style, fight and vibe. Veteran players will enjoy something familiar. Too bad it doesnt have cover system.
+Souls-like element: parry combat allows you to engage in enemy one on one (also lock on).

So far in the game I find it lack in gameplay variety, all we do is engaging in direct combat and just shoot or melee. We need more variety like in Gears of War (riding tanks, or riding creature in GOW 1, riding vehicles, tank combat, vehicular combat, even in SM 1 we have ship-gunner combat) or Stealth-ish playstyle (like in GOW 1 avoiding Berserker, avoiding the bats at night, avoiding the dormant robots). SM 2 needs more variety.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EDIT: With the timely response to fix the recent patch, I can say I look forward to more endless hours of gaming and future content. Great response to your community!

Down-vote until all of the most recent patch is pulled and re-evaluated. As an older gamer I was thoroughly enjoying the game until this patch was introduced. The tethering idea is atrocious in it's current form and frankly I can't see how to even make acceptable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would rate this a 4/10. The short version is this game is not worth $60. It just feels like an early access game with a lot of balancing issues, problems with the AI, and seemingly detached devs They rolled back their unpopular update and are establishing public test servers. There may be hope yet!

Recommended only if you are either a hardcore gamer or only want to do pvp.

Pros:
-Great graphics
-Cool executions
-The audio is immersive
-A lot of armor customization options
-The devs seem to appreciate Warhammer and try to stay true to its lore.
-Story is well done

Cons:
-Braindead AI in operations (maybe the worst I've seen in the past decade). I really cannot stress how awful they are with the sniper-bot being borderline an enemy.
-The AI don't seem to level or change based off your level or difficulty
- Bolt weapons are trash for the most part The devs have increased the damage of the bolt weapons by about 10-15%. Have to test.
-Tyranids call for reinforcements from across the zone, absurdly quickly, and still soak multiple headshots without flinching
-The operations are not consistent in difficulty. I could play average difficulty 3 times and get 3 vastly different experiences in challenge level
-
-Devs are slow to update anything meaningful
-Devs apparently don't seem to communicate on server maintenance. My wife and I were literally at the last health bar of the heldrake and we were disconnected.
-It's borderline impossible to complete the harder difficulties by yourself with said braindead ai without cheesing which is a problem considering weapon upgrades are locked behind finding armory data at these difficulties.
-Probably just my opinion but the Chaos are just boring to fight. They stand around and shoot and that's about it. I know they're supposed to be husks for Tzeentch but they can't take cover? Or use any basic tactics like using high ground or covering their allies?
-A bug I've encountered a lot was my wife would choose Assault (for example), her character would show up on the plane as she had it, then when she would load into the map, she would be a different class.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fun game, but not being able to play ops by yourself is ridiculous. The majority of people that play games want to play solo, just let us do that. Without that allowance, I have no drive to play because, newsflash to the devs, random people on the internet are typically not good people. Let me play solo, and I'll come running back, until then there are other games from devs that understand the concept of solo play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I cannot believe I'm about to do this, but I am giving Space Marine 2 a hesitant Upvote. There are some two deal breakers that I seriously hope Saber Interactive fixes. But before we get into it, there is a fat Horus in the room that i need to address first:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is it woke?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Short answer:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No, . Shut up about it and go cry to Arch about it. It's not an issue the game critically needs addressing at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes the spooky SBI did consulted on this game, but honestly I don't really see any detrimental influence so far. As for Ultramarines not looking 100% like a wet dream of an Austrian painter, lets be real. Anyone worth their Warhammer 30/40k salt knows that there is no canonical establishment of Ultramarines all needing to look like they came from the Austrian alps singing Sound of Music. Yes, all space marine take on features after their gene father (Rowboat Girlyman in this case), but Roboute's gene has far as lore goes is pretty stable and has few if any mutations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All Salamanders look like Pele from SMT because Vulkan gene had a flaw that made everyone black with red eyes. Same goes for some others like Night Lords (scary emo goths) and probably Luna Wolves (bald and angry). Some, like the Raven Guard (sad emo goths) are as a result of their planet's environment (Kiavahr being terrible and Deliverance being a literal â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a moon) or like White Scars (Mongolians) who not only Oct 7 his entire planet in about 20 solar years, but also recruited people exclusively from the tribe who took him in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some Legions (and by extension first founding chapters) like Iron Hands, Luna Wolves, Dark Angels, Emperor's Children, Imperial Fist and famously Ultramarines recruit anyone from anywhere so long as they are worthy. And because their genes are relatively stable, Emperor's Children and Dark Angels than you would any hair on Luna Wolves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not exactly, but you racist AND stupid especially if you didn't know the lore, because from your perspective, why would there be an ethnic limitation in that regard? Get out of here with that you donkey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now with that out of the way, some thoughts about the game:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. If you're a 40k buff, the design, scenery, voice-acting, atmosphere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Audio design for the most of it is impeccable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Combat is fluid and mostly satisfying with one caveat (will elaborate in negative).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Beautiful graphics, even on my 3070ti at high mids it still looks fantastic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Runs very great on my 3070ti, Ryzen 9 and 32gb DDR5. Though would recommend installing it on a nvme ssd to increase loading speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Only played about 1.5 hours of the campaign, but the lore so far is fantastic. How they speak, the mannerism of the Astartes, the imperials, the mechanicus etc are all as they should be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. ESG. This is the biggest middle finger and a complete deal breaker. Nevermind being forced a stealth installation of ESG onto your system, it ironically PREVENTS you from booting the game unless you go into task manager and DELETE ESG PROCESS. How stupid is that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Second deal breaker for many, the FOV is horrible and there is no way to extend it. The space marine model eats 1/3 of your entire view, which severely reduces your peripheral awareness unless you are constantly looking around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. The weapons feel less impactful and heavy than they did in SM1. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if some of the weapon didn't feel so floaty/light (but then again, they are being welded by not just space marines, but Primaris so maybe it gets a pass).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Some weapons don't sound as punchy as it should be. The heavy bolter for example was defeaning in SM1 and especially in the Dawn of War games. Other weapons like the bolter pistol needs sound louder and more punchy (you are literally shooting a miniature rocket after all, and a normal unaugmented human can barely fire it without breaking their shoulders. Unless you're a Catachan, then you can fire anything).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Titus's first voice actor, Mark Strong, was way better than Clive Standen. Don't get me wrong, Clive does try hard and delivers as best he could, but there's something about Mark's voice that really suits a gruff veteran space marine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Despite my grievance with some of the more creative decisions like the changing of Titus's voice actor and weapons sound/feel not as heavy as the first game, I understand why they did it. SM2 gameplay and combat is much more fast paced and fluid than SM1 ever was. It might be a solid reason, from a technical perspective to not have everything sounding like Ferrus Manus clapping Fulgrim's cheeks on Istvaan V or having the screen shake like it's Armageddon on a Tuesday. I can live with those decisions, not a deal breaker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What is and WILL be a serious issue," is the presence of and the poor FOV (which can be easily fixed with an update to allow adjustments).""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm having a really good time. It's well put together and doesn't have a lot of modern day issues. Skill based matchmaking is not a problem for multiplayer as it is not implemented. The PVE mode is fun and provides just enough challenge to be enjoyable several times over. The campaign is wonderfully done. It's very fun to customize your marine even if certain small traits (visor color, some more niiche colors like elbow braces) are not customization.

I would only really ask that the customization for chaos marines and the combat be tightened up just a bit more. It can be frustrating at times to be encouraged to do combos but you also cannot respond to counters/unblockable attacks being thrown in there.

Overall wonderful time. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fantastic follow up to Titus's Story from the first game, with many fun callbacks. It's a classic Warhammer 40.000 story that is easily digestible even for newcomers with gameplay so finely and tightly crafted that I still catch myself getting giddy at the gory spectacle even after 80 hours. A true labour of love from a Developer that clearly loves and respects the IP and who I hope will continue to be with us for years to come.. what more can a 40K fan ask for?

I highly recommend this game to anyone, even if you are just slightly interested in the universe or loved the first game.. and who knows maybe this game can be your gateway into our awesome hobby that is Warhammer 40.000!

I have a love/hate for this game. I'm a big Warhammer 40k fan (games, lore and books). After having invested 139 hours and having leveled up all class to over lvl 18 (2 lvl 25). I can honestly say although the game is as beautiful as it gets graphic wise, it needs a LOT of work. The servers are bad. The balance, wait there is no balance! Very limited ammo, high enemy counts. Inaccurate weapons and when you do hit something your weapons hit softer than butterfly kisses. It takes too many rounds and/or melee hits to kill anything. Getting killed or loosing large amounts of health while locked in a animation is as cheesy as it gets. In short this game doesn't make me feel like a ""Angel of Death, that knows no fear.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

congrats, brothers. helldivers 2 nerf boogaloo part 2 is here.

edit: after the update, things still feel like absolute garbage. imo it's just not fun anymore. if you don't have many friends, playing with the AI in operations mode is absolutely abysmal. if you do have friends, it's easier but the result is still the same: lack of fun.

these developers don't seem to get it, and the fencing nerf was not walked back at all, leaving the melee weapons to feel useless. wish we got a larger buff patch to bring everything up to where it needs to be and not just the bolt weapons. bolt buffs do feel okay but without a proper melee buff/rework, it's just trash.

i like swinging my funny hammer and sword around but the developers said no fun allowed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new update has really made the game a lot less fun. Operations have gone from being satisfying and making you feel like an powerful space marine to becoming a huge grind. Where before the update my friends and I could play ruthless difficulty with level 20 characters that had relic level weapons for a fun challenge, now we are now failing substantial missions with the same characters. I really hope that the developers roll back some of these changes," because I love this game and want to play more to level up the different operations classes.

this game is a fantastic hack and slash with dramatic visuals. I highly recommend this game to both old 40K fans and new. i only have 2 small compliants. 1 the controls are a little unorthodox in my opinion. not impossible to figure out. just odd ball. but this could be easily rectified in the game menu with the key bindings. 2 there is no ultra wide support which in my opinion is very disappointing for a new game in 2024. but again this can easily be rectified with a future update to the game. other than that its a great game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brothers, this game stands as a beacon of the Emperorâ€™s might, a war hymn to His eternal glory.

The campaign of Space Marine 2 is pure cinema, peak masculinity, but in the raw, honorable sense, not the forced ""feelings"" of modern (S o n y) entertainment. It is a worthy successor to the original Space Marine staying true to the true Warhammer 40k spirit, from the grimdark aesthetics and sharp dialogue to the visceral combat and unforgettable catchphrases, this game is steeped in the essence of the 40k universe. It definitively passes the vibe check.

There is no weakness here, no false sentiment, only the unyielding strength of the Adeptus Astartes. This is no charade of emotion from the weakling masses of modern Terra.

This sequel does honor to its predecessor, as any true son of Guilliman honors the gene-seed of his primarch. The game is the very essence of the 40k made manifest.

While fighting through Tyranid swarms, you witness Cadian squadrons holding the line against an unending tide of enemies. These moments offer a powerful sense of scale, while you may be the protagonist, you're just one cog in the massive war machine of the Imperium. The game does an excellent job showcasing the Imperiumâ€™s many parts, from the Astra Militarum and their discipline shouting Cadia stands while being charge by a swarm of gaunts, the Admech with their arrogance, disdain for the flesh and their many rituals to please the Machine Spirit to the zealous and fanatic Ecclesiarchy and, of course, the ever-present bureaucratic nightmare of the Administratum.

On the performance side, Space Marine 2 handles remarkably well, even when the screen is full with enemies and chaos. The fluidity helps maintain immersion, ensuring that you never lose sight of the epic scale and intensity of the battles and the scale of the conflict.

The companion AI, while functional, can be a bit off sometimes, often leaving enemies stunned without finishing them off. If you're not there to clean up after them, those enemies will recover and come back into the fight.

The co-op features are well-implemented, allowing you to seamlessly join your friends sessions via Steam or using an invite code. While playing with random players works fine, there are occasional slowdowns due to the lengthy loading screens when joining or leaving sessions. This could definitely be better as it can get a bit annoying.

Had some issues launching the game tot he point where I almost refunded it because my 1.45 hours of game play were spent troubleshooting crashes. Once I was though the first opening movie the issues stopped.

Space Marine 2 blends and delivers on everything I wanted for a Space Marine game. The gun-play is super satisfying and the melee combat is just on peak. It has been a while since I have played such a smooth game, which just flows like water. The Coop runs smoothly to, as playing with 2 other friends has been a joy to experience the entire Campaign with them and the Operations, it has been a absolute blast and stressful from the hordes of Tryanids and Heretics bombarding us.

Writing a review for non-Warhammer fans, so if you're into Warhammer, I'll just say that this game will probably scratch whatever itch you've got. Go for it. The game was literally made for you.

If, however, you're not somebody who's into playing as a tacky-looking action figure, fighting against barely-legally-distinct xenomorphs, then I'd like to give an honest review after my short time with the game to help you get a bit more of an idea.

Ranged weapon variety? Forget it. You, at time of writing, basically have four major options - some form of 'bolter' (every gun that fires bullets is a bolter, I guess?) that are all more or less very same-feeling, a 'melta' (fire shotgun), some plasma weapons that all differ very slightly from one another, and then sniper rifles. They all get the job done, but none of them feel particularly satisfying. Animation-wise, a lot of the larger enemies don't react to shots whatsoever, so these weapons don't feel particularly 'punchy.' I'd give the actual shooting experience in the game something like a 4/10 - clunky controls, weird aiming system (which is justified by the hybrid ranged/melee control scheme, but that doesn't make it any less weird and clunky) and a lack of visual feedback often just makes you feel like your guns aren't doing much, even if they are.

Melee weapons? That's the good part of this game. Many melee weapons, all with unique combos to learn and enjoy, and individualized strengths even though they, theoretically, should all pretty much do the same thing. They cooked here. 9/10 melee system, very good. Lots of focus on countering and dodges, or knowing how to pull off combos without getting your health bar torn apart.

General aesthetics? Look, I get it, some people adore Warhammer and Space Marines, but like... they're ugly. Horribly ugly. Like something a middle schooler would draw in the back of a notebook while they're not paying attention in math class. To make things worse, the game has you earn cosmetics - perfectly fine on its own! - and the cosmetics will be... a laughably tiny change. ""Congratulations, your reward for completing 40 different 30 minute long missions is - we put a strip of paper on your pauldron!"" Again, I'm sure this is something meaningful for the crowd that happily throws away thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on figures of these guys, but for somebody who isn't all that into it... it's just a strip of paper with a seal. Not a very good reward. Your best aesthetic customization is going to be in colors, and there you have more room to work with, but at the heart of your look you'll always be the same, really ugly action figure.

TL:DR - if you have friends who are obsessed with Warhammer, this is a pretty decent game to play with them even if you have no interest in the setting. Puts Darktide to shame, but that's not exactly hard to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-Ein wÃ¼rdiger Nachfolger-
Obwohl die Kampagne ein wenig kurz ausfÃ¤llt und vielleicht in der Zukunft mit einer oder zwei Expansionen erweitert werden kÃ¶nnte muss man sagen das Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 in allen anderen belangen wirklich abgeliefert hat. Die Kampagne ist an Bombast kaum zu Ã¼bertreffen, die grafische Darbietung ist wirklich optimal in Szene gebracht und lÃ¤sst einen sehr oft mit offenem Mund einfach staunen.

Die Koop-Missionen machen auch sehr viel SpaÃŸ und erzÃ¤hlen die Geschichte des anderen Trupps neben Captain Titus und seinem Gespann.

Die Charakterentwicklung ist bei den Coop-Missionen und dem Multiplayer getrennt und lÃ¤sst aber viel Spielraum um seinen Wunsch-Marine(oder ein bestehendes Chapter) entstehen zu lassen.Die Waffen levelt man separat durch die Nutzung mit.

Der Multiplayer ist auch schon wie beim ersten Teil damals einfach schÃ¶nes Beiwerk und kann auch Spass machen wenn man mit den richtigen Leuten spielt. Aber auch wie damals im ersten Teil ist die Kartenvielfalt nicht groÃŸ, die Hitregistration nicht wirklich die beste und es kann schnell eintÃ¶nig werden.

Es muss gesagt werden das zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt noch Optimierungsbedarf nÃ¶tig ist. Das Game ist strak CPU-lastig und viele CPUÂ´s , besonders Intel 13/14th Generation laufen sehr heiÃŸ bei diesem Titel und erreichen sehr gerne Mal ihr Limit. Eine gute KÃ¼hlung sollte schon vorhanden sein bis da etwas nachgearbeitet wurde. Undervolting sollte bei diesen Generationen ja schon fast obligatorisch sein. Ansonsten ist das Spiel nahezu bugfrei und lÃ¤uft wirklich sehr rund.


Alles in Allem bin ich wirklich gespannt was uns in Zukunft noch alles erwartet....von mir eine klare Empfehlung.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Privacy and data collection is mandatory, doubt barely anyone say the screen since they decided to place it during gamma settings. You must accept or read and accept. cannot deny or limit it. You cannot do what most people do with playstation and deny them in the firewall in/out rules due to needing the game to access EAC and MP.

You do not feel like a Space Marine in this game.

In singleplayer PVE on just veteran difficulty, which is supposedly the intended experience, even (close to) perfect play rewards you with gameplay of being constantly whittled down by weenies into flickeringly low hp when reacting to all commands perfectly and swiftly headshotting and executing every enemy whilst never being hit by even a single clean attack from anything other than explicitly and only small enemies hitting you during your own melee attack combos on larger ones.

Why is the game this way?
Even supposing this is somehow balanced around multiplayer, the mindset that somehow your hypervulnerability is the right way to accomplish this is just incorrect.

This isn't left for darktide (tm) where teamwork needs to be clumsily reinforced by having insta downs/squishiness that let people pretend they are helping eachother in the most hamfisted design decision of all time.

We are walking super human tankmen fighting bugs, and the intended gameplay experience leaves you scrambling for medicae at all times.

I win every time, but I never once feel cool or strong, and further because I am so limited on HP and ammo my reactions are all on rails.
I ALWAYS have to go for the gun reaction post parry.
I ALWAYS have to go for a cutscene execute to gain armor.
I ALWAYS have burn grenades at swarm pillars cascading up walls.
I ALWAYS pick up and use the 'use here' guns like the flamethrower.
I ALWAYS use my super mode on cooldown to scrounge HP.

I feel like a pathetically weak and clunky man walking through a giant quick time event.

Why did they do this? How is being a paper mache weakling who is forbidden from making gameplay decisions the 'intended experience'?

I want to feel like a space marine.
Unless there are changes, the game fails at what is supposed to make it compelling, though it is undoubtedly beautiful and cool looking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 100 hours total, playing just about every mode and map, fighting every enemy, and even going as far as to beat the campaign three different times. I can say without an iota of doubt. That this game has gone above and beyond in giving the player base plenty to do on release.

Loved this game, until patch 4.0 dropped

im not even playing lethal, im just talking about ruthless. Armor feels like its made out of butter again, every ranged enemy can shred it in seconds. With the new spawn rates there are so many ranged majoris and all of them lay mines and its just so freaking sweaty. I can see that ruthless before-patch was a little easy for being the highest difficulty, but it was fun! Now it feels like a chore. They can go ham in lethal for all i care, thats what its for, but i have to play ruthless to unlock all weapon rarities. I hope they at least tweak it so a few more of the spawned enemies are melees or something, or just get rid of that 20% armor nerf for ruthless. Fingers crossed.

Edit: New Update fixed most of these issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TOTAL XENOS DEATH!

This is it, this is actually a worthy sequel to Space Marine 1, a game that endeared me all those years ago and i never though would ever get a sequel - feels good to be wrong. Not only is it a good sequel but it is a direct improvement over the first one, same formula except refined, what a difference a decade makes eh?

Preface before reading, I don't want the game to fail I just think it won't succeed without the heed of criticism. I never write reviews, but this game is being overly praised while being seriously flawed.

Pros:

- Great writing true to the warhammer universe.

- They included many chapters and their heraldry with a great framework to expand upon.

- Everything visually looks wonderful and grim in the best way possible. Not too taxing on my gpu or cpu.
(NVIDIA rtx 3070 ti, intel i9-12900K)

- Similarities and nods to the previous space marine game in the series.

- Audio sounds 'okay' except for the voice act which is superb.

- A fair amount of attention to detail throughout the game which is very nice to see.

Cons:

-Connectivity, nothing more must be said just look at the other reviews.

- Multiplayer being the main staying power of the game feels like an after thought and not fully thought through before implementing it. Of course not everyone cares about the multiplayer, but I see it as what would increase the longevity of the game.

- The melee system overall is very weak, especially in multiplayer. Parrying an enemy doesn't stun or hamper the other player in anyway in multiplayer. You can just wail on them until you when but even that is flawed because you are better off just using your bolter to win melee fights. The firearms do significantly more effective damage and don't lock you in a terrible animation. No aim punch or stagger from melee means closing the distance as a play still is dead, you should just play tactical or heavy every match. Locking your enemy into melee is a decided strategy and is not present.

- Getting kills in multiplayer is extremely underwhelming resulting in both the victor and the defeated just feeling frustrated. It would be rewarding if they care over the execute system from the campaign, maybe give you invincibility frames or just expedite the animation time to leave it for when you have opening for the time it would take.

- It's hard to tell when you are being hit, possible adding armor shift under fire or some sort of light stagger would fix that.

- Hitting enemies doesn't feel nearly as impactful as similar games and for a super human clad in metal. The bolter variants do appropriate damage but it doesn't feel like you are shooting anyone. Maybe this is the SFX department but it just feels a bit hollow.

- Biggest problem with the campaign that I experienced was enemies shooting my teammates and me through the world terrain or cargo containers, anything really it just seemed the ranged enemies could hit you from anywhere through anything. A problem with the engine or the assets I'm not sure, hopefully this gets fixed.

- No friendly fire seems like a mistake, I get its more casual friendly but I believe it does a great deal of immersive damage and also unbalances multiplayer. I can stack grenades on top of melee fights with my teammates just killing the enemy team and also it does damage yourself with some like the shock grenade.

- The physics system needs some work non-static items seem to be near weightless.

- So many great opportunities for fresh game modes but nope they went with the tried and true which is fine. Hopefully they get a little creative with the upcoming modes and maybe pull some ideas from the tabletop.

- A cover system seems not necessary, but would improve the combat immersively and tactically.

Conclusion:

The basics are there but it needs a lot of work, balancing, and straight up system changes. Sadly as a warhammer fan I would have to recommend against purchasing until the game gets some major polishing and a few changes to the core. Multiplayer could be a gem for this game.

Good job to the team so far, sorry for all the critique, good luck with the rest of development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40.000.000 Space Marine 2 el juego que estaba en redes sociales indicando que iba acabar con Helldivers 2, para mi humilde opiniÃ³n lo considero bastante alejado a la realidad. El juego es bastante divertido despuÃ©s de unas horas de gameplay, este ultimo lo considero similar al de Gears 1, aunque su sistema de cobertura no existe, tienes un modo de combate en disparos y a combaste cuerpo a cuerpo que son dignos de los Marines de la saga, sus mapas como el juego mencionado anteriormente es exactamente lineal y no un mundo abierto como uno pensaba que iba tener en mente, su campaÃ±a comienza demasiado bien tras la continuaciÃ³n de su predecesor pero llegando al climax encontrÃ© que solo querÃ­an acabar rÃ¡pido y sin dar explicaciÃ³n incluso disminuyendo su calidad de historia. Siendo que esta parte fue su mayor declive en mi reseÃ±a. Lo que mas me encanto es su cantidad de clases para jugar en multiplicador, en la que puedes usar distintas clases para jugar cooperativo o en contra de otros jugadores. Respecto al precio lo encuentro un poco elevado para lo que era en lo ofrecido. Yo personalmente recomendarÃ­a que lo compren cuando este a 10 o 15% mas bajo ya que para el precio actual no es valido. si lo tengo que decir en palabras mas simple el juego es una ""algo que ya hemos disfrutado antes y solo le agregamos una colaboraciÃ³n con WarHammer"" ahora un resumen:

I really want to love this game but as someone who's hugely into the Tide games by Fatshark I just don't think I can. It fails to capture the fantasy of being a space marine, in my opinion, and has multiple fundamental issues with its combat system. I think the simplest way to summarise it would be to say that it feels like I'm controlling a cumbersome vehicle that barely responds to my commands as opposed to a superpowered human being.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Skill issue, you might say? Well, no, not really. In fact, one of my main problems is that the (incredibly arbitrary, of course, but it feels terribly unintuitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That leads me to how only SOME attacks have audio cues and others don't... Why? Darktide has an audio cue for every melee attack made against you, and it feels great. Sound design in general isn't great here, with boltguns almost sounding like suppressed rifles. The gun strike mechanic also feels wildly inconsistent, and there's the lovely fact that your teammates can inadvertently prevent you from pulling these off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But whiner, why do you keep making comparisons to Darktide? Well, I'd argue Darktide is the best 40k shooter available right now and I don't see any reason to buy this one while it exists unless you truly hate always online components or are one of those (boring... sorry) people who is specifically obsessed with space marines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PvE operations difficulty is MASSIVELY inflated compared to the Normal mode of the campaign which I picked in the hopes of having a fun power fantasy experience. For the most part, the campaign does an OKAY job of achieving this despite the aforementioned issues - and has some amazing setpieces - but the starting operations difficulty is a mess. You are woefully underpowered for whatever reason and are expected to grind to achieve the physical power necessary to actually feel like a badass as opposed to a worthless chump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Something is wrong when I feel infinitely more like a space marine in Darktide as my pathetic little stim addict almost-heretic on even the highest difficulty. I've not even mentioned how painfully unbalanced the Thousand Sons are compared to the tyranids. Inconsistency seems to be the name of this game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm entirely unimpressed by the weapon variety seen here. Bolters, bolters and more bolters. Most of the ranged weapons are simply bolter variants, with a few exceptions, and then there's a grand total of four melee weapons. Rather pitiful compared to what's on offer in Darktide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, what about PvP? It feels totally slapped on to me. Melee has way less of an impact than I'd expect in a *Warhammer* game, the TTK is stupidly fast for what are supposed to be impressively durable supersoldiers, and I've (I'm NOT exaggerating) not played a single match that wasn't absurdly one-sided.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To me it feels as if they created the 6 - 10 hour ish campaign and then realized that releasing a shooter exclusively comprised of that doesn't exactly fly in the 2024 market for the price of $60; so what did they do? They cooked up a half-arsed PvP mode and a co-op PvE experience with an obnoxious progression system in the hopes of artificially extending playtime and creating the illusion of value. There's only minor enemy placement differences on each replay and no semblance of an AI director so content runs dry quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sounds familiar, actually. A lot like World War Z by the same studio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
That value just isn't there for me, personally. I would pay maybe $30 just to experience the campaign which is visually breathtaking and full of cool moments, both narratively, and from the perspective of sheer rule of cool. But everything else? it's just mid, I think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frankly, I don't understand why Darktide was so lambasted for its launch when this game suffers from the same issues of a lack of content," poor optimization and crappy weapons that take forever to tune and actually feel solid. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I really can't find the appeal.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Where do I even start. Not sure who started the rumour, but the campaign is not 6 hrs, f that. It's way longer. I've clocked 14hrs on normal difficulty and skipped half the side missions. I'd say 16-17hrs max on normal. This is an AWESOME game. Masculinity incarnate. Ticks all the boxes. Brotherhood, a calling for a higher purpose, good vs evil. This is a blokes game. It will tickle every masculine atom in your body. That's not to say females wont enjoy this game, you will, it just means you're an ultimate badass.

You don't have to be a lore expert here. I myself am a casual warhammer fan. I just know the basics. And you can too, there are many 1 hour videos on youtube that will read you the basics, and get you up to snuff. Watch one of those and your done.

But here's the gist.

Play as a 7ft tall superhuman soldier, a space marine, created by the Emperor himself. It's a grim dystopian future, humanity is in a constant galactic war for it's very survival. A galactic war that has no end. A war that has raged for tens of thousands of years. A war against Elves, Orcs, Machine races, Tyranids (think Alien xenomoprhs), And traitor humans and demons from the realm of chaos (basically a dimension that originally harboured souls of the dead, but became overwhelmed by constant war and death in the galaxy that it is now a twisted dimension of chaos and evil) a dimension that leaks into ours, twisting and corrupting everything it touches.

You don't have to play the first game, but I absolutely advise it. There a more than a few references to it. It's a great game. This series is gonna be huge. So don't starve yourself of any backstory.

As for the gameplay, I suggest playing on normal, any higher and you lose that power fantasy feel and becomes kind of a chore to play. The level design is incredible, better than anything today, seeing the armies of humanity fighting this endless war in the background is incredible, tanks and apc's rolling around, it's so much fun to just watch. You'll really feel like you're playing an important role in this war. It will feel like it's unfolding in front of you. And the downtime on the ship in between mission is just icing on the cake.

It's expensive. But we need to support devs that remember what gaming is about. Appealing to their audience. Not mass appeal and micro transactions.

So, grab you're weapon brother, and get into the fray.

The Emperor protects!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Man do I want to play this game, but the game doesn't want me to play it. You can't have the same class in a mission (co-op) - fine. Then don't put me into matches where my chosen class is taken. Why is that so hard? If you are joining a match, the game is supposed to tell you the classes of the people already in the match, but it NEVER loads before the 60 second countdown is over. Connecting itself takes a lot longer than you'd think, just to be slapped by the fact that you can't play your class.

I was worried that you'd really feel the absence of the horde mode, and boy was I right. Short campaign and 7 co-op missions at time of writing. I'll pick it up with friends, but if I'm solo then I'd like to actually play a game. Rather than sitting here waiting to be told I can't.

I got to say, the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

After putting almost sixty hours into the game, most of that being grinding out xp on the only six limited PVE maps with friends. I could go and pick apart things in the story from the point of someone who knows the 40k universe, of even some story points that just don't make sense. You can find those on your own.
The story was satisfactory, far from perfect, the visuals are fantastic there are indeed moments of awe.. but by and large those appear to be smoke and mirrors.

Even with the souls like punishing combat systems... yes, you play a space marine and spend most of your time pretending to be a rolling pill bug. Hiding behind corners, but only right hand corners as you cannot shoulder swap, or going into melee to parry, parry, parry, dodge, parry.. unless you like getting stun locked or shot while almost to your feet during the standing animation. More to say there but pushing on to the point.

I'm bored with it. Completed the campaign, on vet. Had some fun. Did some grind stuff with the boys. Found out the combat systems in place feel bad. Again explore the reasons if you like there are tons of videos on both the good and the bad already out there.

Ended up going back to Helldivers, and Darktide. Good try Focus, this one should have stayed in the oven. I don't regret playing it, I do regret paying the pre-order price. Darktide holds more value, and much less of a price if we want to compare 40k to 40k games. Even if you rank it at 1 dollar per hour played, I didn't get my value. Where as DT, a 40 dollar game I've invested 500 hours into. Cannot recommend at this juncture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trotz guter Grafik und einem geilen Setting, von mir keine Kaufempfehlung.

Warum?
1. Die Bots sind nur Statisten. Sie machen kein Dmg, kein Finishmove, nutzen keine FÃ¤higkeiten und stehen nur dumm rum. SÃ¤mtliche Spielmechaniken muss man selbst Ã¼bernehmen (zb. Absorber mit Flammenwerfer fernhalten und parallel mehrere grÃ¶ÃŸere Gegner killen) und nebenbei noch den ganzen Schaden. Kein Thema wÃ¤re Punkt 2 nicht.
2. Die Gegner fokussieren ausschlieÃŸlich dich und rennen selbst an deinem Team vorbei (wenn du mit Bots spielst)
3. Die Fernkampfwaffen, trotz ihrer GrÃ¶ÃŸe, machen kaum Schaden.
4. FÃ¤higkeiten wie Parieren/Blocken werden oft nicht ausgefÃ¼hrt.
5. Selbst ein Space Marine hindern als kleinste GegenstÃ¤nde auf dem Boden wie ein Ast, eine Ausweichrolle durchzufÃ¼hren
6. Nach der Kampagne gibt es 6 Missionen die man immer wieder grinten kann fÃ¼r Cosmetics und Skillpunkte, um die selben Missionen auf hÃ¶here Schwierigkeitsgrad erneut zu grinten.

Went into this expecting to be playing a game.
At this point it's not a game, it's a chore and I'm disappointed.

The world, setting, etc are all really nice. It's oddly relatively well performing too which is more than can be said for a lot of bigger games in the last five years.

But, it's busted. The enemy AI targets only the player, doesn't take into account the player mechanics - so you're more than likely to end up between getting hit and getting hit, because if you deign it necessary to block, dodge or parry you are also allowing something else to do their thing because they basically ignore the rest of the squad. This extends out of the campaign to bots in the Operations mode, so there's no respite from awful mechanical failure there either. Never mind the minibosses that stunlock you because you miss a dodge and because of recovery animation just wail on you from 100% to 0 with no way to escape due to how the attack chains are set up. Or the lack of indicator on 90% of parry-possible attacks, or the lack of any form of recovery outside of what would be UT99's worst healing pack in a game that a basic mob can stunlock the protagonist. Ugh.

It feels like an attempt to implement an Arkham style riposte system, but it doesn't work when everything you do with it leaves you open to more damage. Why even use it at that point. Stop targeting only the damned player to the point it's not playable. Please.

EDIT:
After more playtime, some time in multiplayer and practice with the game systems;
Still not sure I want to recommend this.

Multiplayer routinely has connection/stability issues which are not PC/ISP connection related from what I've seen, and the combat whilst satisfying at times still has the issues with stunlock etc.

AI squad members (which you unfortunately see often) are also worse than I initially thought in both campaign and online, having no capability to follow directions (such as attack/defend) featured as part of the main UI, no perks in Operations, no proper target priority when picking one out, no damage against actual boss tier enemies, and more. About the only thing they can do properly is fire a weapon at mobs and recover their own health outside of combat, leaving everything for the player(s) to do which can be borderline impossible. They routinely ruin Operations runs for example.

This game has a single player tag on Steam, but truthfully is not one. If you would buy it as a single player game, look into the solo gameplay in existing videos or streams first as it's a bit deceiving to say it truly is a single player title. It's ALL focused on having a (human) group. All of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great way to take your first steps into 40k. If you liked Gears of War, this will be right up your alley. Loved every second of the game and am looking forward to where it goes.

85/100

My rating definitely could go up as I continue playing and learn more about 40k to appreciate it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The games very good, especially the campaign. It is masterfully crafted with well written characters where every single NPC feels alive and have a personality (their little conversations are quite interesting) and the environment is extremely immersive as well, with very detailed structures and biomes.

PvE and PvP are quite fun as well.

Overall its a great game!
(If you enjoy everything Warhammer 40,000 related, then you'll probably enjoy this game's campaign as well)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall I regret my purchase and I wish I bought Wukong instead (it was down to these two for my September gaming).

SM2 is kinda like Gears of War or God of War I guess. Its core gameplay is fun but unfortunately very shallow and repetitive. It lacks any meaningful RPG mechanics. The story is short, not replayable, and you can't significantly customize your main hero. The squad mates are also not customizable, and are dumb as bricks. I did almost finish the campaign and it was alright, mid at best.


I also just put a few hours into the main ""meat"" of the game, which are the coop Operations. And yeah, I simply don't see myself continuing to play this. The levels are super linear, but movements is so slow and in combat you're stuck inside animations for half the time. Combat = parry simulator, and honestly the Batman games did this much better. Clearly the game was meant for console peasan...I mean players, and ported over to PC. It worked for them, the game sold a lot. But MKB feels terrible. The progression seems fine, but the loop is just not there for me.

Simplistic, shiny spectacle would be my best description of SM2. I wasn't familiar with the first game, so I didn't really know what to expect. Extremely overhyped by game reviewers, and I totally fell for it.

Runs well, looks good, but gotta give it a thumbs down. Game will probably settle in around Mostly Positive, which is exactly what it deserves.

For that Warhammer feel, for me personally, I'm just gonna go back to Darktide and Helldivers. For this type of combat, the Batman games are vastly superior as Bruce doesn't fight as if he weighs like a ton of bricks, sloshing his weight around in slow mo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Campaign:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great Cinematic experience, better with friends, very cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Only low point I can think of are the """"Rats"""" section of the 2nd mission and some downtime sections from the """"Cave"""" mission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PvP:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's ok, a bit death-bally and significantly less emphasis on Melee in my short experience with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't have much interest in it before and quickly lost interest in it, so I haven't played a lot of rounds nor grind each classes to unlock their other, more interesting weapons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Co-)Operations:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Patch 3.0 (2024/09/26) update:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Armor attrition vs Minoris is better which made the melee combat survivability less punishing or gunstrike reliant. Adjusted spawns for the Chaos faction nerfs made it less overwhelming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall an improvement to the push forward combat that plays better and makes you feel more like a Space Marine, but also makes the game easier (which I think is alright as they will add new enemies and difficulty tier).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also fixed the bugs with the Supply pod full healing characters with +20% max HP passive/ perk and healing past contested health bug with Melta/ Las Fusil/ etc. which is good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Original Launch review:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only having 6 missions on launch is terrible, -Tide games and World War Z had more on launch in the past and still needed more content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Balance seemed all over the place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At the higher difficulties, there are fewer resources, it felt similar to the tactical survival experience of Back 4 Blood and World War Z. Depending on your build, you want to be thrifty with ammo and to save it for a wave/ Terminus miniboss/ or an enemy calling for reinforcements from an out of reach place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enemies becomes bullet spongy at higher difficulties and are more numerous, and Medicae Stims heals less HP. Different weapon types seem to have different effectiveness vs specific enemies. Running away to the next airlock/ elevator to despawn enemies behind you is cheesy and effective, but not fun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You have to ration your ammo in-between fixed ammo crate placements and try to use melee, the environment, and equipment you find as optimally as possible (explosive barrels, explosive flowers, and level gimmicks such as the fire wall at the end of the first mission or the train diverter control panel in the last mission).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regardless of the difficulty, missions have RNG aspects to it such as the mid-level events requiring 0-6 (!) sub-objectives to complete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Perk and class balance seemed to be all over the place, but I need to play more to be sure, and there seems to be some bugs or hidden effects.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Examples for balance stuff:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Certain classes have ammo generation perks later on in their class (or weapon perk line) which seems to be a mandatory pick compared to the other options;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- Bulwark's 23 perk restores contested health to your max HP which substantially reduces the need for healing items when paired with executions, or allowing full heal + wound restoration when paired with a Medicae Stim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also you use the same currency to buy weapons, class perks, and Space Marine Chapter Customization and you always feel poor while progressing initially, with some classes having more expensive weapons (e.g. Assault).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You also need to grind each class and weapons types. You can max out a class to level 25 and still need to level other weapon types, but trying to do it in the higher difficulty sucks because your lower tier weapon is weak," negatively affecting the strength of the team and your character.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J'attendais ce jeu depuis son annonce, ayant adorÃ© le 1er ""Space Marine""... Et je n'aurai jamais du l'acheter, mais je vais essayer de dÃ©tailler pourquoi.

DÃ©jÃ , les points positifs :
-C'est super beau, graphiquement c'est impeccable et le style artistique colle parfaitement Ã  Warhammer 40k.
-L'histoire, bien qu'assez simple (comme c'est souvent le cas dans Warhammer) s'Ã©coule fluidement et on s'y laisse prendre.
-Super Ã©tat technique, en 4 heures de jeu je n'ai croisÃ© qu'un seul bug : les collÃ¨gues IA qui spamment les grenades dans l'ascenseur, et encore Ã§a n'a pas durÃ© longtemps.

J'ai fait le tour, oui c'Ã©tait court, maintenant les choses qui fÃ¢chent :
Pour faire simple : Prenez ""Space Marine 1"", retirez tout ce qui rendait le jeu fun et vous avez ""Space Marine 2"".

-On passe de 4 armes Ã©quipables Ã  seulement 2, ce qui rÃ©duit considÃ©rablement les possibilitÃ©s de gameplay et pose un gros problÃ¨me sur la gestion des munitions (tout le temps Ã  court).
-Le systÃ¨me d'armure censÃ© protÃ©ger ta barre de vie ne marche pas. Chaque barre d'armure encaisse 1 seul coup (et t'en a que 2), alors vu que t'es en permanence en train d'affronter 50 bestioles Ã  la fois autant dire que l'armure elle va pas Ãªtre active trÃ¨s souvent.
-Le systÃ¨me pour rÃ©cupÃ©rer de la vie est franchement naze : fini les exÃ©cutions qui te permettent de rÃ©gÃ©nÃ©rer tes HP, maintenant Ã§a rend 1 barre d'armure (Cf le point prÃ©cÃ©dent pour comprendre pourquoi Ã§a marche pas bien), tu ne peux rÃ©cupÃ©rer que quelques uns des derniers dÃ©gÃ¢ts subis et uniquement au corps-Ã -corps... Rendant tout le combat Ã  distance complÃ¨tement inutile vu que tu ne peux que perdre.
Alors, ils ont bien mit des objets de soins... Enfin je crois, ils brillent tellement par leur absence que j'ai passÃ© les 3 premiÃ¨res heures de jeu Ã  me demander si ils existaient vraiment.
-En parlant des armes Ã  distance : elles sont toutes A CHIER. Sans dÃ©conner, qui a remplacÃ© le Bolter par un Nerf en plastique ?! MÃªme en vidant un chargeur entier (25 coups) en plein dans la tronche d'un seul mob autre que les petites merdes qui rampent au sol... TU LE TUE PAS ! Les armes font des dÃ©gÃ¢ts misÃ©rables et Ã§a casse complÃ¨tement le cÃ´tÃ© ""Badass"" qui vient avec le fait de jouer un Space-Marine. Je joue un super-soldat de 3 mÃ¨tres cinquante qui fait trembler le sol quand il marche... Et je me bats avec une arme qui tire des pruneaux secs, paye ton anticlimatisme ><
-Les altÃ©rations d'effet alÃ©atoires qui t'empÃªchent de jouer, genre le poison qui rend aveugle ou l'effet de confusion qui fait que tu perd le contrÃ´le de ton perso, etc...

Combine tout cela en mÃªme temps... Et tu peux juste pas jouer : entre les altÃ©rations random qui t'interdisent complÃ¨tement de faire quoique ce soit, la moitiÃ© des ennemis qui te rognent ta barre de vie Ã  distance (barre de vie que tu peux pas rÃ©gen vu l'absence quasi-permanente d'objets de soins et les problÃ¨mes de gameplay citÃ©s plus haut) et le fait que tu peux pas tuer les ennemis par manque de dÃ©gÃ¢ts et tu as le combo parfait de l'anti-jeu.
Space Marine 1 Ã©tait un Hack'n slash bourrÃ© de testostÃ©rone ou tu t'Ã©clatais au milieu d'une marÃ©e d'orks...
Space Marine 2 est une punition dans laquelle tu essaie dÃ©sespÃ©rÃ©ment de t'amuser face Ã  un systÃ¨me conÃ§u pour te ruiner le plaisir de jeu.

Vendu pour 60 euros, j'appelle Ã§a une escroquerie.

Edit : en mode de difficultÃ© basse, le jeu est super sympa et j'y ai pris beaucoup de plaisir... Mais l'histoire devient alors trÃ¨s courte, et les dÃ©fauts de game-design et d'Ã©quilibrage que j'ai dÃ©cris ici perdurent, mÃªme si ils sont beaucoup plus discrets.
Je ne peux pas le recommander Ã  son prix de base, mais en promotion il peut valoir le coup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Was 100% for the game and loved it until I learned that you cant solo operations and are forced into either joining as a group or slotted with randoms. If you play in offline mode to solo it there is no progression either other than emperor funbux to get new cosmetics.

Can devs please just quit with this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥? I'm so sick of not being able to play a game to its fullest without dealing with randoms.

Paid 80 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?dollars to not enjoy 1/3 of the game. Why even have the AI squadmates? I can see that they are releasing the private lobbies for PvE content but that's something that's supposed to be there on day one.

At least they aren't going the Darktide route and just saying ""Oh what? We never said solo or private lobby I have no idea what you're talking about. Anyway the cash shop has a new rotation"" and plugging their ears and are actually making it a priority to put it in game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gÃ©nial, c est rare que j'achette un jeu a sa sortie, franchement je ne regrette pas, j ai poussÃ© les paramettre graphique au maximum, le jeu est super fluide, pas de lag pas de crash avec un graphisme super.
le game play est fun , il reste dans la lignÃ©e du premier space marine avec de bonne evolution.

les fans de warhammer 40k ne seront pas deÃ§u :)
Pour ceux qui ont des pc obselete, : try to prey the Emperor, (meaby) he will provide :)

---------------------------------------------------

Un petit mot pour les expert et les rageux des bad review (evaluation negative) :

Avant de poster vÃ©rifier vos pc et laisser la possibiliter de vous offrir de l'aide pour vos soucis en activant les commentaires.

ce jeu demande une configuration avancÃ©e, oublier la configuration minimale, un ssd, et un pc avec au minimum des valeurs simmilaire a celle de la recomandation optimale.
si malgrÃ© cela vous avez encore des problemes, il faudra regarder ailleur, pour exemple via votre gestionaire des taches pour reperer ce qui prend beaucoup de ressource sur votre machine, voir si tous vos drive sont a jour etc...
ce que je peu dire Ã  titre informatif, le jeu fonctionne super bien, fluide, pas de plantage, configurer au maximum au niveau graphique sans perte de performance et il me reste enormÃ©ment de ressource libre sur ma machine.

La configuration des bios par les constructeur de carte mere pour les processeurs dernieres generation sont souvent la cause de beaucoup de probleme sur les nouveau pc.(connu chez MSI et Asus, mais d'autre aussi).
Une mise a jour des bios ou le reglage de ceux si sont necessaire pour diminuer la surchauffe et les plantages de vos pc ou pour stabilisÃ© vos processeurs. (recurant sur les processeurs 14 eme generation)

dans vos setting du jeu privilÃ©gier fsdr2 et pas le dlss, avoir un ecran Ã  haute frecquence hertzienne n'est plus un luxe pour les dernieres generation de jeu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outrageously little content for a $60 game;
and what little content there is, is far cry from perfect, aimed at very specific audience;
the game gets carried hard by aesthetics.
------------------------------------------
The setting is well enough executed.
Voice acting - great.
Combat would be good if it weren't for a ridiculous and hardly customizable control scheme. (It's poorly ported from console to pc)
Story is short and uninspired, decent in co-op;
there's like 6 missions 1 hour each on average,
then 7 more ""operations"" which are on one hand side missions happening during main campaign, so you get to see move POVs which is a neat trick, but on the other there's character progression during those operations which I'd normally be a fan of, except the progression is absent in main story, there's 7 missions, about 30 minutes each, which give you around ""1 level"" worth of experience, and there's 6 classes, 25 levels each, so it gets hella grindy hella quickly. Overall okay at best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amount of shill ideals put into this with god awful UI, just ugh.. You have to unlock multiplayer from playing the single player and the game doesn't remotely explain this while putting a ""register your account"" option on the front page CLEARLY for the purpose of getting people to sign up to their website, that think this is how you access multiplayer. WHICH IS NOT NECESSARY AT ALL, they have it designed like this with the exact intention of getting more emails and information they can use or even sell. This is NOT for your benefit remotely, but purely for the sake of making more money than whats needed, PERIOD. That is NOT an opinion, this is scummy marketing tactics 101. Everything about the launch of this game has been rife with it.

So far the game mechanics in the campaign are not impressive and overly complex(parrying and dodge system in future war settings? just stupid) beginning of game starts out with an awful map design, felt like a free to play shooter with god awful tutorials even, but maps do look great further in. Everything about it shows they have SOME talent in their dev team but clearly there are a lot of corners being cut.

The tutorial windows, that are like skin shop advertisements being thrown in my face, are not useful... and are more annoying than anything. Giant windows explaining things that anyone would know if they've played a shooter, while making me hold down a key i don't normally use just to get it off my screen. Campaign feels like I'm playing a REALLY messy/clunky batman arkham with waaaaay worse UI and a map that doesn't scale and is overwhelmingly linear. A parry and dodge key for... space marines... feels a little silly in a universe where weapons are so devastating that there is no such thing as parrying, you get hit or you dodge... Was simple and made absolute sense to the 40k universe. And yet everything is ridiculously tanky, absolute bullet sponges with paired dinky sounding effects to really make it feel like you're shooting a water pistol.

The bosses are so insanely stupid, who ever's idea it was to make bosses SO ridiculously over the top tanky shouldn't be in game design, you're bad at it and you clearly need obvious things explained to you like you're a toddler. It's so bad, even to their acknowledgment, that they put in infinite ammo box you can keep restoring your ammo at, BECAUSE, the bosses take about 1,000-2,000 shots each, literally not exaggerating.. All while you can only hold around 100 for each gun.. There is a obvious problem there, this shouldn't need explaining..... But then again, common sense today might as well be considered rocket science, being how our industries/schools are teaching people to use feelings and not work ethics tied with quality/professionalism. From government/politics to corporate shill tools, there are people sadly that want everyone to be gullible emotional idiots, easier money with less/simple PR campaigns..

The sounds... LORD OH MIGHTY THE SOUNDS ARE SO BAD..... It sounds like i'm slapping big pillow enemy's with a 1 handed pillow in every melee fight, shooting sounds like im shooting a pellet gun into air, because only impacts you'll hear are the killing blows.. There is NO opinion about this, nor a polite way of putting it, their audio team is bad. Imagine being in a mechanized suit that is designed to last multiple lifetimes, drops into world war esque battles through out their existence, with a hand cannon that fires rounds that are so large and complex that it has its own propulsion system, only to have it sound like you're firing a nerf gun while wearing heavy boots.. HOW DID THIS PASS STANDARDS FOR THEIR TEAM LEAD?! not saying the game should blow out my ear drums, just some balance would be nice!...

The multiplayer doesn't show much promise with how they're designing a really shallow ""battlepass"" and gimmicky pvp.. Incredibly grindy unlocks, which i don't mind too much oddly. Though some of the unlocks really feel fairly pointless for getting after HOURS of gameplay, like a 1% difference at times, pretty silly.. Chaos space marines jump kicking each other with grapple hooks in 1-ton armor? umm no, wish i didn't get to witness that.. Besides that, really just needs a bigger selection of maps.

Have to say, i loved some of the skins, which feels weird saying seeing they're plugging skin shops day 1 before fixing anything, Darktide vibes, ugh.. Some of the gun-play is good, just the sounds need to be adjusted. The cliche voice acting where you can tell the space marines trying to sound gritty was a bit over the top... Easy to have chaos sound good with it, since they're twisted evil beings, just fits, always does. Doesn't with the good guys, when exaggerated..

To sum it up: really messy game design with an obnoxiously clunky parrying system that has no place in a 40k setting, this isn't Darksouls. THIS SHOULD NOT NEED EXPLAINING, is how i would sum up a lot of their design choices. Go read a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?book about warhammer 40k, drop the emotional truth act, and think critically about what should and shouldn't exist in this platform. How the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ has this become so complicated when it's fairly straight forward?

Maybe you guys should focus less on the family photo's before launching a game and more so about being a professional that's making a product that sells its self. Crazy concept huh?

-----------------------------
THAT IS A PROPER WALL OF TEXT, UGH....

This is how 40k eventually will be watered down by really stupid game designs that will possibly leak its way into actual lore. Imagine korn beserkers having batman grapple hooks and jump kicking people in thee most unrealistic way imaginable... Like their team has actual toddlers in it, pitching idea's, literally feels like it, not joking..
impression of clueless toddler esque intern: ""umm boss sir man, i really like the grapple hook the batmans uses, my daddy also likes the batmans"", reply from Teamlead while he is wearing his spin-hat: ""well timmy, we don't need to follow any sort of guidelines, warhammer is an easy cashgrab, put in what makes you feel happy buddy"" Shortly followed by wadding up a fist full of customers money and consuming it like he was a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ nurgle over lord inflicting pain and disease onto the very soul of currency that mankind is obsessed with.

I truly hope this game gets panned out, i am obsessed with 40k games. I don't want to give this game a bad review. But I'm not about to make a review based on emotions and virtue signaling like you see across steam today..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

There will be a TL;DR at the end.

~

The game falls short of its own shadow in many ways.
It is without character development and story
It is without the variety.
It is with a less consistent/polished core loop.

The testosterone filled glory of the combat swells the brain with glee, but dulls after a few hours.

- Controls Are Awkward - KBM is trash, youâ€™ll need a gamepad, although itâ€™s not much better. You never really get used to it.
- Multiplayer Focus - In case youâ€™re here for the campaign.
- - Repetitive, but not bad,
- Not 40k Faithful - Boltguns tickle enemies, Chew Through rare enemies, blasphemous plot, etc.
- Surprise! - It wants to be a Live Service game.
- Unfinished Grenade UI - they seem the same on HUD ?
- Gun Execute is Blah - at the beginning is super cool;not punchy enough, you end up chaining them together over and over to kill 1 guy.
- Ammo? - It is not precious, but it's also not plentiful.
- FOV - way too shallow
- ""Hold to interact"" - ew.
- Buggy - Including enemies shooting through walls, not picking up items, clipping, and more.
- Missing Features - Canâ€™t snap to targets. Needed for controller.
- No squad customization - ???
- No Troop Variety - Never fight beside mechanical troopers or mercs. Sad.
- None of the little soldiers ever survive - :(
- Campaign Overstays Welcome - It's a 5-6 hour experience in an 8-9 hour package.
- Very Stingy on healing - Awkward unlike other games in the medium.

- Bullet Sponge Enemies - Dump 3 clips of bolter ammo into a normal guyâ€™s head.
- Stun Locks - Get messed up and tossed around sometimes.
- Antithetical Dance - Combat stutters and fails to flow.
- No Upgrades in Campaign - All the cools stuff is in Multiplayer.
- Lack Of Mechanical Depth - Tastes like a cake missing ingredients
- Sound is off - voice is especially low.
- Flat characters - Unsurprising and uninteresting.
- No collectables - ????!?
- Health Sponge - Armor is fickle, and your health is constantly chipped down with few ways to earn it back.
- AI allies are goofy - and enemies disregard them.
- Invasive ""Always Online"" BS - Makes it harder to enjoy at times.
- NDA and Information Harvesting - I donâ€™t usually have to sell my soul to play a game.
- Was that my gun? - Non-dynamic weapon models for cutscenes. Câ€™MON ITâ€™S 2024!
- Pinning animations are too long - repeating several times.
- Bosses are boring bullet sponges - Not mechanically challenging, just take forever.
- No Controller Presets where swapping weapons is NOT on the D-Pad - You will be doing this constantly
- Weapons don't feel like wins - they all feel like losers in some way.
- Pathetic weapon variety - They look drab and insultingly similar, they play the same.
- Bosses are normal enemies? - For some they just slap a big healthbar on a normal Elite enemy and recycle others.
- Neutral melee attacksâ€?- cause your character to turn around and not attack where you're facing.

- Solid flow - fans rejoice!
- 2010's goodness - Simplicity!
- throwback - ""Cooridor Shooter"" vibes in a good way.
- Great Enemies! - Tyanid/Zerg foes are super fun to blast away at!
- Looks gorgeous - Pleasing to the senses!
- Music can be inspiring! - Swelling overtones!
- Juicy - Tons of executions and combat punch
- Guns sound powerful! - Even if they donâ€™t do much, you feel like a beast
- Fun with Friends! - Everything is, but this is a good experience to share!
- Satisfying Destruction! - My therapist recommends this.
- Lots of cool locations! - No longer stuck on the machine world of !
- Nerds Rejoice! - Lots of little goodies for 40k fans!
- Lots of variety! - Modes, Modes, MODES! Throwback to 2009 with how much content!

is fun for a time. Itâ€™s novel for 40k fans who will enjoy the tropes, much like many star wars folks these days. Hyper dramatic combat loop dazzles at first and fizzles without variety, but keeps you engaged to get your moneyâ€™s worth. Made me want to read the books, had novel vibes at times in a good way. It's more of the original Space Marine 1 without too much added, and thatâ€™s good in and of itself. The game has a AAA look and a mid-range feel; while suffering from the issue of having lots of enemies to kill and not enough resources to do so efficiently.

~


is a game.
Itâ€™s not gonna blow anyoneâ€™s mind or shake up the market - and in many respects itâ€™s a throwback to over 12 years ago when times were simpler. While several shortcomings might keep it from being top shelf, it will certainly be a good time thatâ€™s worth your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TLDR - The game is great but the initial experience during the early access was atrocious for co-op. I highly recommend it now but I can't leave a thumbs up for paying to play a Beta test for their co-op servers. Co-op was advertised ages ago, it should've worked for everyone in all regions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My initial experience before the server maintenance:-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Get yer damn co-op servers running. We can barely play together dangit. It has bee 6 hours of being in game," half that time was either me looking at """"Joining server"""" or my friend experiencing the same. And when we do play... it's not so bad. Game's pretty fun. But hot damn get the servers workin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another 7ish hours later and the co-op servers still suck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tried all the possible fixes on the internet and still nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This game was advertised to having co-op so you'd expect to have it on the get go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the server maintenance:-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The co-op finally works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No work around, no fiddling with the settings, just share your code and there's your friend in the lobby. The squad works in all game modes. I'm having fun and I'm enjoying everything the game has to offer and am excited to see what comes next on the road map.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If you wanna know more about the game itself check out the other reviews cause they can probably do a better job explaining it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With all that said, first impressions count and that initial roller coaster of nothingness still has a lingering impact. We were told we could play the game early if we bought it early. Apparently, that only applied to certain people and in certain regions. Some people got their moneys worth while others didn't. As much as I want to leave a thumbs up for the game," I can't. I can tell you the game's good now overall but that's as far as it goes. I don't usually pre-order games but hot damn it was never bad enough to write a review about it.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This latest patch is really not it... Feels like Helldivers 2 all over again. Adding new operations as well as a new difficulty for people who love a really hard challenge is great, but personally i REALLY feel like the other nerfs were wholly unneeded. I'll check out the game again in a few months to see if they rebalanced things, but I'm out for now.

UPDATE :
The devs seem to have gotten the message and are walking back the bad changes they made in the previous patch. They are also buffing weapons that actually need buffs They are also planning on opening test servers for people to test changes before they release them fully, which is much appreciated. Changing my review back to positive. Will keep an eye on this and change it back to negative if they release another bad patch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prinzipiell ein gutes Spiel, aber ich kann einfach nicht guten Gewissens Faulheit supporten. Aber was bedeutet das?

Grafisch ist das Spiel sehr gut, kein Meisterwerk aber bedenkt man wie viele Gegner gleichzeitig im Spiel sind is das schon ok. Ich spiele auf 4k mit ner 7900XTX und nem Alienware Oled Monitor. Alles auf max und man hat zwischen 40-80 FPS also sehr gut optimiert. Leider kein HDR support.

Die Story ist halt totaler Schwachsinn wenn man sich mit dem Lore auskennt, der ganze Planet mÃ¼sste voll von Space Marines sein damit man Ã¼berhaupt ne Chance hat, aber gut is halt ein Spiel das is auch ok.

Wo kommt die Faulheit ins Spiel? Beim Kampfsystem, eigentlich kÃ¶nnte das ein geiler Shooter sein aber die Entwickler erzwingen einen Mix aus Nahkampf und Fernkampf damit hab ich kein Problem Darktide hat das ja sehr gut gemacht.

Aber hier ist das extrem schlecht umgesetzt, man bekommt nur aufs Maul weil man konstant umzingelt ist das Spiel baut darauf auf das man das aushalten kann, was mich stÃ¶rt ist das die Gegner KI speziell die FernkÃ¤mpfer nur und explizit den Spieler angreifen, groÃŸe Gegner wie der Carnifex kÃ¶nnen Fernkampfangriffe komplett abblocken, mit 2 Schwertern ja ne is klar. HÃ¶here Schwierigkeitsgrade sind total lame gemacht einfach Gegner hat jetzt mehr HP und macht mehr Damage. Bei den Nahkampfangriffen hat man sich gedacht wenn man nach jedem Hit so ne art Lag einbaut verpasst das den SchlÃ¤gen mehr Wucht aber es nerft total, aber anscheinend bin ich der einzige den das stÃ¶rt. FernkÃ¤mpfer treffen einen auch immer wenn man nicht aktiv ausweicht, also nur in Bewegung bleiben hilft eigentlich nicht.

Im Prinzip ist es WWZ im Warhammer Universum die Tyraniden klettern sogar exakt gleich wie die Zombies wo rauf.

Ich denke wenn man das im Coop mit echten Menschen spielt is es sicher ganz lustig aber mit Bots fallen die SchwÃ¤chen halt total auf. Wenn man hier keinen Spacemarine spielen kÃ¶nnte sondern das irgend ein anderes Setting wÃ¤re kÃ¶nnt ich mir gut vorstellen das das Spiel auch gefloppt wÃ¤re.

Objektiv wÃ¤re Darktide das bessere Spiel WENN sich Fatshark dazu herabgelassen eine Kampange einzubauen oder irgendetwas mit der Story zu machen.

Fazit: Kann man sich durchaus gÃ¶nnen, wenn das Geld knapp is auf nen Sale warten das dauert sicher nicht lange kurz vor Weihnachten. Es ist ein gutes Spiel wird dem Hype aber nicht gerecht. Aus dem Kampfsystem hÃ¤tte man echt mehr rausholen kÃ¶nnen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basically an upgrade on the original Space Marine in every way. More content, more combat options, more visual spectacle, no microtransactions, runs well. There are some minor bugs that I've encountered during gameplay, and also had some issues seeming to stem from crossplay server function, but the server issues seem to be worked out for the most part.

Highly Recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before last patch there were servers issues.. after patch it is even worse. 9 of 10 times I get a black screen or it won't load.

They have adjusted difficulty for people who played in groups for 200 hours+ but can't be bothered to fix the game for us people who can't even play the stupid game.

They care more about clipping armor pieces.

I wrote a ticket and as answer I've got that they are aware of it and I supposed to play and TRAIN in campaign mode for now.. this was already over 2 weeks ago.

Saber! How about you train your company how to finish a game before releasing or how to fix it?

The game is tough, brutal and has some really visceral combat. If you love Warhammer 40k and enjoyed the first you will absolutely love the second game. The scale has been impressive it feels like fighting huge zergs of enemies and if you play as Co-op you will have a blast with friends.

May update after playing the campaign",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Als 40k Fan ist das Spiel eine 10/10 und eine Empfehlung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Neutraler betrachtet ist es ein solides Spiel, aber bisher nicht mehr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Schlauchige Level, die Missionen dauern zeitlich zu lang, es gibt keine Nebenziele oder alternative LÃ¶sungsmÃ¶glichkeiten wie in Dawn of War 2, die Story hat irgendwann Probleme mit der Geschwindigkeit und die Aneinanderreihung von Finishern lassen das Gameplay nach den ersten Missionen arg eintÃ¶nig wirken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Die AtmosphÃ¤re ist toll, aber wÃ¼rde nicht 40k draufstehen, wÃ¤re es maximal ne 4/10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nachtrag: Das ich nie meine bevorzugte Klasse in den EinsÃ¤tzen zocken kann," weil das Matchmaking jede Klasse nur einmal zulÃ¤sst und diese dann bereits von einem anderen Spieler ausgewÃ¤hlt wurde ist pure HÃ¤resie. MÃ¶ge der Zorn des Imperators euch holen!""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basing this off of the singleplayer campaign, I'd give this game a neutral review if I could, I enjoyed some parts of it and some parts not so much. First off the game does look and sound amazing and does Warhammer 40,000 every bit of justice it possibly can, there's tons of detail everywhere and the environments and scale of the enemy hordes are seriously impressive. And it's not just a cosmetics thing, you can see the swarms climbing walls and such and you can destroy them. The basic combat once you get used to the parry and dodge system works pretty well and the weapons feel like they all have a use; I tried to use most of the weapons I picked up during my playthrough and there were few straight up upgrades, more like sidegrades.

The structure of the missions is very linear and there's generally very few things to find apart from audio logs. At the start of the game it felt like you got obstructed very often, I kept walking into invisible walls, but I think the game opens up later on more and the midway part of the campaign had the best mission variety. Sadly I think the campaign falls off towards the end, but other than that, I mostly had a good time. I wish the jetpacks would have been used more in missions.

Now onto the things I didn't like; the whole campaign seems designed more for co-op play than singleplayer. The AI teammates are generally very bad at covering you while doing objectives (+ they cannot do objectives themselves), and you'll regularily get pinned down by ranged enemies all the time, so in every encounter you have to hyperfocus the ranged enemies down first because the AI won't be doing that. At first I started the campaign on Veteran difficulty and I found it to be too annoying to complete with the AI so I switched to Normal after a couple missions and had a much better time. But still the squad AI could really be better, the game should offer a more balanced singleplayer experience. (EDIT: This was improved in patches which is good!)

Also (potential spoilers warning), the campaign isn't very long, I finished it in just about 11 hours, while generally taking my sweet time to explore as well. Towards the end it's like they forgot the beginning of the invasion (Tyranids) completely and the ending felt very cliche and Disney like. I did like that they introduced more enemies later on and I'm a fan of different than usual Chaos factions being represented but it felt like there should have been more story missions across all the planets. I know there's the Operations mode and Eternal War, and I expect that'll add a lot more playtime, but the main campaign felt quite short. (EDIT - Operations has been quite fun if a bit grindy, Eternal War is a pretty typical pvp mode and could use more interesting maps and customization imo)

The game ran well on my laptop with an i9 13980 HX, 32 GB RAM and Nvidia 4090 RTX 16 GB; on 2560x1600 resolution I could play it on high settings with ultra textures (without any upscaling), getting between 60-80 FPS. Some of the larger fights dipped as low as 50 but not below that. I'll probably test how it runs at 4K later on but I'd expect it to require some DLSS at least.

I didn't like that the game has no support for aspect ratios other than 16:9, so at 16:10 I had constant black bars on my screen all the time and it should really be fixed as it's a standard feature in PC games. Also, there was no support for inverted horizontal camera controls for gamepad, so I couldn't play it on gamepad since I use fully inverted controls (both vertical + horizontal) in all games I play; another thing that should be fixed and added to options. Had to learn to play on keyboard & mouse instead :p

TL;DR:
Solid gameplay; nice WH40K aesthetic; poor AI and mission design more for co-op; short campaign that falls off towards the end; some annoying missing technical features",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 has a good potention but Saber can't see it.

Campaing are awesome even if it's just changed Space Marine original campaing.
Like Orks => Tyranids, Nemiroth legion => Thoused sons. LoL.

Ops at first month were cool it was a challenge to master all classes and unlock all avaible weapon and until devs drops patch 4.0 game had some problems but after all problems were are just get stronger.
-Enemies are bulllet sponges and Bolts (That are Mini-Rockets with high armorpiering potention) feels like .22LR on high difficualties cause enemy HP got x4 modifiers but many bolt weapon had only 2-2.5 DMG that just a joke
-Zoantopes became just flying fortreses that can instanly kill you even if you dodge it in right timing. And don't even try to take cover from beam devs think it's good idea to make them go through any obsticale.
-Chaos is just BORING. Fight against ranged enemies with pea-shooter while yjey use .50BMG with Inferno modifiers. This is just a bad joke.
-Ping issue also made ops are more stupid on higher difficulties (on ruthless and lethal we got -35% dodge invulnerability and perfect dodge windows)

PvP also got good potention and again Saber just abondon this gamemode for 3 months.
-No new maps
-No new gamemodes.
-No balance chages (Only nerfs good weapon)
-No shuffle teams after match that makes it's very unbalanced

Right now devs goes into silence and not respond on any community questions. And for me we must be heard and try to make it game a masterpiece of Warhammer 40K franchise but now it's not deserve any praises and rewards like GOTY because game is too far from it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game has now become the benchmark for introducing people into the world of Warhammer 40k in the easiest way possible.

Main story is of reasonable length, and the Operations mode offers a metric ton of replay value. I have not played the PVP, but accounts from friends have been generally positive as well.

The game looks incredible, sound design is intense, and it's just damn fun to stomp around exterminating any enemies of the Imperium.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9-9-2024: Release day
We have:

- No HDR support
- No DLSS 3 support
- No ultrawide support
- No FOV slider

What have the devs been doing since the game went gold on 9 jul 2024??

I will update this review once we get a patch that adds one or more of the missing features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game is fun. Sadly after the Hotfix on release my game just constantly crashes on startup after the first Warning Screen.
The Problem seems to be the Intel I9 Series, that just doesn't work with the game currently..

I have tried everything to fix it. Trust me EVERYTHING. Even wrote .bat in the Game files scripts.
As long as i can't play the Game it sadly gets a negativ review.

Edit:

I found the resolution. Just gotta install Intel extreme Tuning Utility and set the Performance Core Ratio from 56x to 52x. After that it worked fine for me!! finaly i can die again FOR THE EMPEROR!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Me likey.
Is like a mix of GoW and Halo
and maybe Mass Effect 1-3 (before the most recent garbo one idr what it was called)
and World of Warcraft
and Old School RuneScape
and SOCOM and America's Army and SWAT 4 and Gran Turismo 4 and NBA Live 2005 and Nascar Racing 2003 Season
or some other good game from way back in the day when games were good idk.

Photo mode in campaign ez pz and makes for really cool screenshots.

PvE is teh funs, wish it had an option for private without a full lobby, or AI fillers or somethin tho.

idgaf about PvP but that's probably good too idk go look at some other review

Dwigt Shroot aprov
Def 9 beets out of 10
Maybe 10 beets out of 10
Def 10 beets out of 10 in the future when even more content/DLC are available.

U shud probably buy it if u like cool stuff and whatnot but like idk I'm not your friend, buddy. I'm just some guy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game is good, but has room for some extra polish or optimizations.

The story is a good power trip where the content feels challenging but you have the tools to do it. Some of the gimmicks wear themselves thin, even more so as a solo or duo where you have to trust the bots to deal the main damage over yourself (such as ripper segments). Thankfully these segments are few and far between. PVP is also fun with 6v6 matches and is enjoyable even though the modes are pretty basic.

My biggest complaint right now is the fact PVP map pool is only 3 maps. The road map indicates a new map in 2025 but that means 3+ months grinding on only the current small pool. This and the slow pace of unlocking gear in PVP, I can see being a point of burnout for people. Also PVP matches really need to shuffle teams as two three mans can queue snipe each other to doom stack a lobby. Just general flow around menuing for PVP is also kinda clunky between the amount of load screens and waiting. For instance you can't edit your loadout in match, you must finish your game, then load into your battle barge, go to the armory and wait for the robo boy to slowly come down all while a timer ticks for the next match. To the point why even bother loading into the barge when all of this could just be menus you can flip through post match. And on the point of load screens god they are a pain. I know I don't have the best computer but even my friends are faster rigs have long load times just getting in and connected",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can increase the difficulty, and there are many ways to increase the difficulty, but you choose to weaken the player's equipment or values, saying that it is for balance adjustment. After adjusting, go and see the appearance rate of explosive weapons? Can you check the appearance rate of assault soldiers at the highest difficulty level? Have your production team ever played a game they made themselves? Let's talk about the highest difficulty level and the level of challenge and gameplay. What kind of 'dog poop' rewards are offered for the highest difficulty level? Experience? Everyone can play this game with full level professions and equipment, which can be used to gain weapon experience. I've endured it, but what else is there?? ornament?? What do I need that thing for?? I don't even ask you to come up with a new weapon. Can you create a red weapon data that matches the highest difficulty level and upgrade the weapon to one that matches the highest difficulty level? Isn't changing skin your strong suit? Are you too lazy to do it?? What substantial reward is there without my chicken feathers? I am sick and so bored to go to jail with my friends. After my friends are tired, I am also tired. Another issue is the gameplay and challenge, yes! In order to prevent players from getting bored, you put in a lot of effort to release the entire N5, brushing elites everywhere, swarming insects everywhere, fighting from start to finish, and having fun? Cool chicken feathers! What player are you cutting?? You can stack quantities, and you can also create new monsters, right? You insist on weakening the hot melt, weakening the counterattack, and secretly manipulate the power of the special battle plasma. Disgusting players, you guys are really good at it!!!! Just talking about balance, how many of those funny shotguns can hit N5? Why isn't that balanced? We have to fix that clustering mechanism. There are so many special elites who need special combat plasma or sniper flintlock guns to deal with brain bugs or distant gun bugs. As a result, you give the whole clustering and force the characters in the back row to be bound to the front row. Just kidding! broï¼?Also, I am the ultimate player, but! But! But! The game itself is a semi-finished product, and you are so inefficient and perfunctory. Chocolate that was originally like poop can be eaten, but now it's good, now it really turns into poop. The ultimate version player is not human, right? They are all dogs, let you cheat around. I am a fan of the Warhammer IP, I also buy chess pieces and play games. I remember when there were CG short films at the beginning, I was so happy. I waited for this game, but ended up waiting for a bunch of dog poop.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before playing this game, I had to walk away in fear of Xenos, since they were swarming the streets. And I had to tolerate and see Fanatics and Heretics causing war in the outside world. After buying this game, my problems were solved and I could exterminate the Xenos and Purge the Heretic myself! What else could I ask for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seriously though, great gameplay. Things could be even better, if, for instance, some optimization was done. Right now, you need tech that isn't available to many Battle Brothers. And it feels bad to go into battle naked like a Cadian... Sort of...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Still, it is probably the best Warhammer 40k game I have ever played. My biggest issues are the loading screens... In countless cases, we are faced with a loading screen after another loading screen," making us lose precious _TIME_!

This is everything that a 40K fan could reasonably expect, and more. Playing through the Campaign with my friends put me right back to playing Gears of War on Xbox 360 back in the day.

The Campaign is utterly amazing, and is multiplayer up to 3 player (I was crying from joy pretty much the entire final mission, especially the sequence revolving around your Company Standard).

The PvE Operations mode shows off how good the combat feels and how well it's designed. Highly replayable for anyone who falls in love with the game.

The PvP Versus mode is not very highly developed, and is very small scale instead of large scale like I'm sure most players would prefer it, but it benefits greatly from being dumb fun thanks to the game's basic mechanics. It just works, shooting each other as these characters haha. Resources demanded they couldn't release with a highly polished PvP mode.

This game deserves all praise and support that can be heaped upon it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So the game was fun until i hit the 13 hour mark and the 3rd patch dropped. The patch bricked the game on my steam deck (which it previously worked on and was rated as playable, a stays that since changed) and my laptop.

So despite the game being bricked for me by the maker and steam, steam has decided that they can't refund the game because i played 13 hours already. So i guess i paid $70 for 13 hours of game play, yaaaaa for me I guess",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can draw a straight line between World War Z and this game. If anything, it leaves you wanting more. More maps, more enemy types, more everything. Nothing here overstays its welcome, and though the character writing is flat, it takes an already great formula from their last licensed game and faithfully applies a new license with a lot of attention to detail.

It may need some optimization to play better on Steam Deck and older systems, and if the prior game is anything to go on, the monetization will be light.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE GOOD

- An amazing tribute to an amazing franchise
- Horde system from WWZ mixed with the Doom healing system
- Gore galore
- Spectacular cinematic moments
- Amazing campaign
- Lore accurate elements, from characters to enemy factions.
- Challenging on the higher difficulties
- Multiplayer PvP and PvE modes (more coming for free)
- Technically fluid and bug-less for what I could see
- Lore accurate class system for Multiplayer lets you choose your style
- Impeccable voice acting

- Repetitive actions, this gets a bit frustrating overtime
- Facial expressions are a bit bland, especially in combat
- Campaign is very linear
- Extremely unbalanced on high difficulties

Space Marine 2 improves from its predecessors by building up from what made it great for me in the past. Filling the shoes of Titus once more, you are now a Primaris marine (super space marine). Bigger and badder, you and two of your other buddies (coop) or AI companions are required to prune the Tyrannids (think Zerg from Starcraft, but much nastier) and put an end to their invasion.

Using the same engine from WWZ the devs at Saber Interactive have managed to capture what it would feel like to participate in an uphill battle against endless the Tyrannids. With hundreds of enemies on screen at the same time, you are required to use all you have in your arsenal and eliminate the xeno threat in the name of the God Emperor and boy is it intense on higher difficulties.

Though big and bad, you are still only human and while the smaller Tyrannids wont have you breaking a sweat the bigger and nastier ones will. I like how in higher difficulties you are required to time your attacks properly and use your ultimate move strategically to turn the tide against the horde of xenos rushing at you.

Simply put, I like the gameplay in Space Marine 2 as it manages to capture what it would feel like to be a super soldier in the 40k-verse, the small tyrannid variants explode as you stomp and chop your way through them, while the big ones will have you ripping off their heads in an execution style move.

Fun fact, you can literally run through small traitor guardsman and they would explode and turn into paste!

Story-wise it's your run of the mill 40K game, one minute you're dealing with a tyrannid invasion and the next will have you once again dealing with Chaos. It's nothing new, but the presentation is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ amazing. Thanks to the technology that the devs utilize, the guardsman are in full display here and I was so happy to be able to fight alongside them once more.

So much stuff goes on in the background and in some instances you can even assist the fights that are happening in the background should you wish. It doesn't add anything to the story but it was nice to know that you are part of a larger scale fight and that everyone in the vicinity plays an important role in it.

For those who are worried, yes the game is a sequel but the events from the first game is told to you relatively well and not to mention its pretty straightforward. So no worries on not being able to catch up or anything if you did not play Space Marine 1.

Longevity-wise the game offers different game modes other than campaign such as Operations which is the PVE mode. This mode will have you squad up with pals and/or randoms to level up the different classes and unlock customization options. This customization is also extended to the PVP mode which is fine, I enjoy playing it with my friends and some matches can be quite intense at times.

All in all I think Space Marine 2 is a good game, the presentation is great, campaign was engaging and serving the God Emperor once more has never felt more satisfactory! an easy 7/10 for me!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nice classic Shooter, with great customization (for the adeptus astartes anyway, traitors dont get customization), amazing visuals and refreshingly traditional gameplay. Of course the setting couldnt be better and its entirely on point. Multiplayer is fun and progression is rewarding.

Destroyed Steam Deck / Linux Player-base in 1 Day

Really disappointed I have to give this game a thumbs down but Saber is not taking their Steam Deck / Linux player base seriously with the latest patch that has effectively bricked the game for almost all players on that platform. The AVF error bug is preventing everyone in that user group from connecting to multiplayer and the response from the Saber has been 'Wait until winter, Linux is not a big priority right now.'

The replacement of Linux builtin anti-cheat (which worked completely fine in the past) with EAC silliness has caused massive problems. It has effectively become a ""un-check this box to disable Steam Deck"" that either devs did on accident, or something else. The fact that Saber is refusing to release a quick hotfix is really frustrating. I'll change my review when they fix this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game is exactly what Warhammer 40k aspires to be. And maybe even more.

The Dawn of War series was built around the already long-time established Warhammer 40k IP, but it came out SO GOOD that it appeared to be an even better embodiment of the setting than the ""original"" itself. And so, paradoxically, GW started to take insipration from DoW themselves, further developing the 40k setting as we know it today.

And I think that Space Marine 2 is yet another brilliant game like this. One that takes inspiration from the 40k's unique atmosphere, but nails it so well, that it will now determine the development of the IP for years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to like the game, I really do. It just seems very flashy with no substance. Some of the kills or combos are great, but beyond that there are only 7 maps which play pretty much the same over any over again.

Customization of your guy ranges from a Bolter that does no damage, but fires fast to a bolter that does a slight bit more damage but fires slower to stabby bits which are either dull, weak, or useless. You will have moments where you feel powerful then go back to dumping 49 bolter rounds into 1 enemy who then proceeds to murder you completely unaffected by the weapon.

You cannot interrupt enemy attacks, moves, or critical strikes, but they can interrupt yours. The best thing to do is use the Codex Astartes approved front flip instead of movement because it makes you practically immune to all damage and you can't outrun anything anyway. I recall reading this in much of the lore on how Horus kept front flipping to get away from Sanguinius till he saw 1 opening to win. It is like having the high ground except you look silly. 90 enemies shooting at you? Front flip till you get behind cover! Melee guys all over you? Front flip away till your team can help you. I believe this move was covered in Chapter 27 of the Codex Astartes to include perfect form, how to properly tuck in your belly, as well as not get your giant nuclear backpack to get stuck on rocks.

Your Emperor approved Power armor is great except occasionally you'll get tangled up in those weeds in your garden you can't seem to eradicate or random dudes firing flashlights at you to great effect. It makes you wonder how some Astartes can become veterans as it seems everything can hurt us greatly. ""I fought in 100 campaigns! I was the first one shot in each mission and had to rest behind a rock till it was over, now I am the Captain because everyone else died 20 seconds later screaming something about glory. They made really attractive corpses though.""

I suppose the game has some potential, though it isn't as customization as Darktide, Rogue Trader or Daemonhunter. Most the Astartes will look the same though in different colors. Or your weapons look like they belong in a BDSM dungeon you have to sign a waiver for to get access.

If they can get the wonky controls fixed, some power to our weapons (or give us more powerful weapons with more enemies), and some more maps this game has some potential. Right now it is good for about a month then off to something else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great game for 40k nerds like myself. i would say at the moment though the operations get very boring (if they featured more random elements it would be alot better) the pvp is okay though i dont imagine anyone would buy this game solely for the pvp. EDIT; Except ""Azzy L."" he bought it solely for PVP

also the Campaign is quite short, ill leave it at that no spoilers.

if you are slightly reluctant about the game id wait til its on sale eventually, its not bad at all its just for its relativley high price it doesnt quite have as much content as id of liked it too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Honestly one of the best games in recent times, even if you are not a warhammer fan. With everything being launched in alpha, or beta stages, its beyond refreshing to have a game launch completed, and playable, where it was about simply having fun with friends or crushing waves of mobs on your own, is incredible. If you like atmospheric games that can drag you into its setting. DO NOT hesitate on picking this up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Im a huge Warhammer 40k fan.

I will post a deeper review but right now this is unplayable for me.
I have a monster pc. Visuals are great. But i keep getting disconnected every 15 min. I have a 500/500 mbit line, no issues with other games. I run my own servers on other games and people have zero issue connecting and staying connected etc.

I got the most expensive edition of the game. So far, story is OK.... visuals are great, custcenes are rly good, some animations are a little off, your shoulder gets dislocated every time you take a step. Voice acting is amazing top tier stuff huge thanks to the actors.

Gameplay tho is repetetive to death. You go to a area get and kill some mobs and u go to next area and kill some more mobs.
You run around a corner. The enemy literally stands stationary. Not even reacting to you untill you get close enough. It just feels so janky and doesnt ""flow"" at all. In those situations mobs dont feel ""alive"" at all. They are just waiting for me to kill them so i can go to the next area...

And its hella empty on content. Not enough missions for the pve. Not deep enough missions to keep the pve interesting. And to be honest customization is a little meh. How many years of dev and this is it? And then you bundle up some more customization stuff for dlcs and lock it behind some random named currency.. Come on, What do you think this is? Im gonna wait here like a little puppy for 3-4-5 months untill u give me one skin of each, one weapon, one armour skin, and some random faction that basically dont mean anything. And this is going to keep me hyped to play? gtfo i payed 99 bucks for this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dude and i still disconnect constantly and it infuriates me because i have a hard time playing pve and pvp.

Weapons are like pee shooters. Melta guns/cannons doesnt melt â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Literally 2 meters from a bioform the heavy melta should incinerate that bio like nothing, but i put 3 shots in to this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and he still running around like i tickled his chin. The bolter is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?hand rocket launcher and face shots do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™? They are getting miniature rocket powered artillery shells that are specifically design to pierce armour and blow up right in the face and they just keep walking. I understand its a game, but i dont feel ""Space Marine"" powerfull at all.,

If this is primaris space marine. It feels like a downgrade. You pop 2 shots off before the enemy is to close so you start to flail around like a spastic ape trying to put in some ""combos"". These combos are so slow that you manage to get swarmed so now you have to start rolling around like a moron and swinging randomly to get ads down before you can focus on the bigger guys that have been shooting at you from a distance.

Primaris marine? Everything hurts. One of these smallest creatures step on your toes you take damage.
These primaris marines take damage from the smallest las gun from a grunt. While on the internets you can clearly see space marines comfortably standing in front of a stationary las turret and eat that like the tank that he is. Not in Space Marine 2. I guess they made the primaris armour a little softer so it doesnt chafe as much in the crotch area....

Space marine 2 made me kinda understand why they turned to the chaos gods for more power......

Ive read alot of the lore. And the story depth that exists for 40k is almost immeasurable. Space Marine 2 story feels a little rushed. There is so much story they could have put in to this about the chaos marines for example. Where they come from. Their primarch etc or sooomething more.
When they showed up on screen it felt like. Here is your new enemy, he looks like you but he has a special hat and hes purple. And im chasing this mfker asking myselfe why the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ can he teleport?
And i cant let go of the tought if alot of it got left on the cutting floor.

My second heart hurts that i have to give this a negative review.
If the connection issues dont get solved and we dont get some amazing dlcs for rly cheap.
This season pass for 39 bucks is not ok either. 20 bucks difference from the full game? The season pass is not worth the 39 bucks. Not even close. I dont think its even worth 20 bucks.
A couple missions for pve and pvp maps and some small skins....39?

I know you are getting alot of praise right now by the normies impressed by the visuals and the ""fresh"" gameplay. And the people who are starstruck from the sheer weight of the 40k franchise. You might wiggle your finger at those people and have them easily impressed.

But im looking at you. And i see what you are doing. I take my hat off for a step at the right direction compared to some of these other devs. But i see what you are doing and i dont like being taken for a fool. These dlcs better be damn good.

Not impressed what so ever. Horrible launch for the price that I payed for at least. And i have been playing warhammer games since the 90s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game started light on content with puzzling design choices, but I was willing to give it a chance as the premise seemed good.

After this first update where the developers doubled down on nerfing stuff and buffing absolutely nothing, introducing a new difficulty where everything is tankier, in a game where the enemies already felt like bullet sponges... I really cannot reccomend it for the amount of content it offers at the moment.

The combat when you look at it is pretty shallow and at high level of play there's three usable classes in PVE with one good weapon, the rest are literally unusable as they deal too little damage. The entire melee weapon roster is underpowered, in a game where melee is supposed to be the focus of the combat system.
(You can literally look up the datamined DPS values of weapons and compare them yourself.)

Half the class roster feels like it's filled with useless perks that activate on very conditional triggers and the PVP is an unbalanced mess that is already getting swarmed by cheaters.

If you really love warhammer then it might still be a worthy purchase, but honestly I regret spending money for a 12 hours long campaign that has no replayability whatsoever, coupled with multiplayer modes that also offer no replayability or reward. (other than unlocking new colours for your space marines, wohoo!)

At this point it feels like no matter how shallow a game is, as long as you have pretty graphics and speak against the ""DEI Agenda"" then you'll have a ton of gamers supporting your game and saying it's amazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game has probably the worst networking issues ive personally dealt with in a game, unplayable lag, constant dropouts. Past maybe 15-20 hours this game has absolutly nothing to do if I wasnt so invested in the lore I would have dropped it after 20ish hours. The AI director is completely broken as of writing this, there is no incentive to play or get better due to there being no worth while rewards past level 20. The level is capped to 25 so even if you got satisfaction out of seeing a number go up you dont even get that. Most weapons except for a few are completely worthless on higher difficulties. theres just too much too even care about typing ill revisit this game in maybe a few months after dlc is made because if this is the content we can expect ONE armor set one weapon and MAYBE a map this game is really not it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impressioni complete qui: https://ladecimaarte.com/2024/09/23/space-marine-2/

Space Marine 2 Ã¨ un videogioco propriamente detto, puro e semplice. Cesellato a regola dâ€™arte, lineare ma mai noioso o banale. Soprattutto lo trovo divertentissimo. Divertente anche in compagnia: quella giusta, fatta di amici con cui ridere, scherzare e fare battute mentre si combatte e si spazzano via orde di nemici.

Chi conosce lâ€™universo di Warhammer 40.000 puÃ² cogliere la cura, lâ€™attenzione e la dedizione intorno a miriadi di piccoli particolari che fanno puro â€œfan serviceâ€? PerchÃ© il fan service non Ã¨ solo sessuale, come qualcuno potrebbe pensare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great, better than the first games in every way, but. A a few gripes of mine, for starters. If you've progressed through the campaign & you weren't the party leader with friends, none of your progress is saved. Your campaign progress is tied to whoever was the party leaders.

So if you want to replay specific missions you would of had to of been the party leader yourself, otherwise you can't play them.

So if you want to continue where you left off, you have to plan it accordingly with your friends and have the same party leader, (harder if you're all in your 30's with jobs and families) or play it all over again solo or as the party leader with a new batch of friends.

Vehicles? Turrets? Anything? Nope. All infantry combat, which is fine, but it felt like a cop out. You're even teased with a tank in one mission, and all it is, is a in game cutscene from A to B, nothing more.

Speaking of cutscenes, although beautifully made, a good chunk of the gameplay is just that.... pre-rendered or in game cutscenes.

Lack of the variety of enemies. There should of been more variants. Once you start going through missions combat sadly starts feeling the same unless a certain point in the game a new enemy is added into the mix for plot/campaign status. But then it quickly looses it's excitement when it just falls in line with everything else and just becomes the norm again.

However despite those gripes, i thoroughly enjoyed it. There is also replay-ability value there if you fancy a go at all three of the main characters of your squad with their different unique abilities. 8/10


CO-OP Missions

I like how they have been designed. They are aligned with the main campaign. They focus on a different squad of AI/characters related to the story that do their plot/story progression on the side unseen from the main campaign. But this time you get to play them. And knowing how certain events happened and why from the eyes of this new squad is a nice touch of story telling.

The added bonus to it is you have a lot more freedom of choice, you have all 6 classes to choose from, play around with, customise and level up. Everything weapons wise is unlocked from the get go so freedom of choice / chance to experiment isn't locked behind a levelling tree.

What you do unlock however is customisation and upgrades for your weapons/gear.

Is the co-op fun? Yes. Is it a bit of a slug fest after you complete the full set of missions based/linked to the campaign? That totally depends on what you personally like. I enjoyed myself, but I don't see myself really ever replaying them again other than to play with friends for a nice chill sesh.

If grinding away against endless hordes of AI is your thing. With games such as Darktide, then this is right up your ally. I've already sunk enough hours into Darktide however to do it all over again. 7/10

Eternal War (PVP)

This is personally my favourite aspect of the game, despite it's current bare bones structure. Levelling and unlocking is accustomed to the usual stuff you see in games such as Call of Duty, level up, unlock new gun, new item, new gear, play away.

It is however a lot more grindier to gain XP and points for skins/customisation items then it's CO-OP counterpart. Which can be challenging for some but rewarding for others.

There are already some very overly powered meta's in game, if you're going against high levels and a majority of your team is low levels, you're going to 9/10 have a very bad time.

Only 3 maps, all that a custom to the three game modes.

Annihilation (Team Deathmatch)
Seize Ground (Domination)
Capture & Control (King of the Hill)

With the three maps, map knowledge is essentially an advantage at this point if you've played longer than others. Their design, look and feel is very symmetrical, it extremely reminds me of Gears of War 1, 2 & 3's Multiplayer Map Design. There are no advantages to which team/spawn you're on, everything spawn and level design wise is balanced.


All in all very fun, challenging but rewarding. 9/10


Needs/Wants in no particular order for the game

BRING DISMEMBERMENT AND GORE INTO PVP, IT'S 40K! I WANT GORE AND BLOOD!

BUFF THE SINGLE AND DOUBLE MELTA GUNS IN PVP, THEY ARE SO INCONSISTENT

A Deathwatch Titus perspective Campaign DLC. I want to see what he got up too during that time. Plus Firstborn space marines look cooler than Primaris anyway.

A Chaos perspective Campaign DLC

A Tyranid perspective Campaign DLC

A Horde/wave mode for CO-OP

New game modes for PVP (Rush from the Battlefield Games)

Larger scaled maps for PVP

More weapons, PLEASE JUST GIVE ME A DAMM SHOTGUN

Allow more customisation/freedom for Chaos & Space Marines on PVP & CO-OP

Galactic Conquest like mode for CO-OP & PVP Events (from the OG Battlefronts)

Make Tyranids a playable faction in PVP

Bigger teams for PVP, 6v6 is far too small, Space Marine 1 had 8v8 and Dreadnaughts

Introduce bigger scale for everything on PVP, maps, team sizes, introduce AI into the battle.
It doesn't feel like you are in 40k, it feels bare bones almost like a Halo online match but with a 40k skin slapped on top. Make it feel like 40k!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the unfathomable and merciless darkness of the 41st millennium, only war and duty endure. For a veteran who has devoted over 25 years to the universe of Warhammer 40,000, it is not merely a pastime, but an existence dedicated to tales of courage and fury. Local Games Workshops are no longer just stores; they are sanctuaries of fervor where meticulously painted miniatures awaken under the hands of devoted artisans. Some, like my brother, have even achieved local fame, while masters such as JÃ©rÃ©mie Bonamant shine on a national scale.

Witnessing the armies of the Astartes, the Tyranid hordes, and colossal war machines come to life in a video game reignites the latent passion of the old warrior Iâ€™ve become. Itâ€™s a triumphant return to the glory days, where every detail, from the smallest Imperial icon to the legendary Land Raiders, is recreated with breathtaking fidelity, capturing the very essence of what it means to be a servant of the Emperor.

The campaign is an epic of rare intensity, where neophytes and veterans alike unite in a brutal, merciless spectacle. It is a blood-soaked work, where steel and determination clash, a perfect outlet for those seeking to escape the monotony of their banal lives. Under the command of the iconic Sergeant Demetrian Titus, you embark on an unrelenting crusade against countless enemies, some of whom appear for the first time in a video game to face the wrath of the Imperium, all modeled with a meticulousness worthy of the Omnissiah.

The gameâ€™s PvE is praised for its demand, rewarding those who master the art of combat and forge their Space Marine with care, without ever drowning in sterile complexity. The gameplay, as fluid as a bolter spewing death, transcends the heaviness of the armored hero. Every step of this warrior, weighing like a Rhino, is felt in the heat of battle. As for PvP, while it offers epic clashes, it still lacks that brutal essence that permeates the universe of the 41st millennium.

In conclusion, this opus is a divine offering to those who seek an intense escape into fury and glory. But be warned, the path is fraught with challenges, the difficulty is high, and learning the patterns is essential if you do not wish to be torn apart by a Tyranid. Find yourself battle-brothers, for only heroes united under the Emperor's banner survive the storms of fate. It is a masterpiece for the initiated, a final war cry that will pin you to your throne.

The blessings of the Omnissiah:
â€?Imperial visuals: The graphics, in 4K Ultra, are grand frescoes capturing the majesty of the Imperiumâ€™s cruisers in the cold void of space.
â€?Heroic crusade: Every mission is an epic battle where heroes are covered in glory and receive the highest honors.
â€?Tactical maneuvers: The gameplay, as sharp as the skirmishes of the Space Marines, challenges Xenos and heretics with a consuming rage.
â€?Homage to the ancestors: A saturated ode of references, as faithful as the archives of the Mechanicum, preserving the very essence of the original game.

But the work is not finished:
â€?PvP too limited: Clashes between Space Marines must capture more of the brutality of the 41st millennium.
â€?Endgame content: The Mechanicum must forge more missions and quests to extend the heroesâ€?epic journey.
â€?Bestiary too limited: The battlefields thirst for new enemies, whether it be rampaging Orks, Necrons, or the cunning Tâ€™au.
â€?Warp instabilities: The Tech-priests must resolve the server disruptions to ensure a stable experience.
â€?Uneven difficulty: Some enemies, like the Neurothrope, seem beyond the reach of mere mortals.
â€?Capricious parries: Squads must perfect their mastery of close combat to ensure effective responses to enemies.
â€?Resilience of the Primaris: The Apothecarion must enhance protocols to ensure the Primaris reflect their legendary invincibility against the hordes.

The Forges of Mars are already active, preparing future improvements. For the path to glory never ends in the unforgiving universe of the 41st millennium. For the Emperor and for humanity, this game aspires to ascend among legends.

PS: As a devoted servant of the Imperium, I can attest that my war machine, forged in the most powerful industrial worlds, knows no failure or weakness. No crashes, no framerate drops trouble the blessed functioning of this technological relic. My cogitator runs with immeasurable power, so much so that even in 4K Ultra, it barely awakens, effortlessly maintaining 60 FPS (capped), like an Astartes meditating before battle. However, I understand that some may face the dark forces of optimization with configurations less blessed by the Omnissiah. May the Machine Spirit aid them!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Product received for free

Probably one of the best 40k Games made for years!
The combat is engaging, fun and hard!
Unlocking gear is enjoyable and you can skip some of the unlocs to get mastery points by using resources found in-game.
The game is beautiful to look at and the encounters are great!

We need more content for PvE but I'm thinking that will happen down the line, it seems like they will support the game going forward.

Only tried PvP for a short while, but it felt fine - melee goes straight through armour to health. It seems like no matter how much you've unlocked, you get paired with people.

Looks like Saber went the Helldivers 2 route and totally went bonkers. Loading times suck, all classes now suck equally and the difficulties are now even worse. Why do games like these looks ""promising"" at launch but when updates start they go ballistic and screw up the PVE experience? Playing on Average now is like playing on Ruthless and the devs don't fix the crucial parts like connectivity issues but instead introduce meaningless ""game balancing"" (maybe what Saber meant as game balancing is more for the enemy rather than players).

To those who are thinking of buying the game, hold off until Saber realizes that what they implemented is way worse off then what was intended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[4.0 Review] Once again, another good game decides to do â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balancing. Nerfs all across the board without any buffs in sight. I'll change my review if this changes but if not, I hope this stays a black mark on this game. I admit, I didn't find the game that much harder last patch but frankly, I just dislike nerfs to PVE experiences in general so I will rate negatively on principle.

[4.1 Review] Glad to see a responsive set of devs this time around who seriously considered whether they were correct in their decisions or not. Removing the Armor Tether is a great change since the initial system was poorly thought out to begin with. Hopefully they add a different modifier down the line that creates meaning without hamstringing your own gameplay. Also glad to see the Bolt weapons finally getting the love they deserve. Honestly, it was criminal how lousy they were at the start since Saber have managed incredible Bolt weapon sound design and feel that just made them feel good to shoot despite being impractical due to low damage. I'm generally ambivalent toward the armor changes but hopefully it gives more people more margin for error due to not everyone being parry gods or being so overwhelmingly good that they can carry a whole team out of a completely FUBAR scenario single-handedly.

In all honesty, i was very hyped for this game and avoided any game play footage or deep dives into the game. pre-purchased as i played the first one and can confidently say, Space Marine was an absolutely great game for its time (Emphasis on for its time. Key factor for this review) So the date of release comes around and i boot up and dive in. I'm going to keep this short and to the point. The Campaign was absolutely amazing, the scenes of battle and fighting through battlefields was amazing and immensely fun. They really captured the feel of 40k with every mission. Superb.... Roughly 8-9 hours later.... Story finished.... And honestly i cant give any reason to come back to this game after finishing the campaign. I had built up in my head that they were going to go down the Hell Divers route with this game and open it up a bit, really expand on the online social aspect of it. But they never. Its a very linear short story which is great mind you. Cant fault the gameplay and story at all. its Space Marine 1 improved, not expanded and that's my problem with it. There are like... 6-8 online operations that you can play as a team online with 2 other players and you can play those over and over again i suppose if you want to unlock different armors etc.... but to what end? To play through the same 6 missions with new armor? There is the online but like Space Marine 1, i just cant recommend it at all. Played one match and noped out of there. Does a linear story at 8 hours long survive in today's climate? I'm not sure. But i would be lying if i said i wasn't disappointed that i'm essentially just uninstalling this game after playing it for 8 hours. Though those 8 hours were fun and very well put together story wise. If you're fine with a linear 8 hour story with some side content sprinkled in to top it off then i would say go for it. If you were hoping for more to get engaged with and dive in deeper, i just cant justify getting it for the price. Its Space Marine improved.... Not expanded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A slight departure from the first game, but a good one!

Originally I left a negative review on this game after I started a new campaign on Veteran. ""I just did my fourth play-through of Space Marine 1!,"" I thought, ""I'm basically a Veteran already!"" Oh how wrong I was. I got frustrated that I kept dying, and blamed the game for it. It wasn't until I put more hours in that I finally caught my stride, and I can play Veteran comfortably. For your first campaign run, I suggest playing on Normal.

Space Marine 2 continues the tale of badassness of Demetrian Titus, and I feel it definitely does him justice. The campaign is short, sweet, and bombastic as all Hell and jumps the shark (positive) in the final two missions. The writing is solid, the gameplay loop hard but fun.

The biggest change from SM1 to SM2 is the melee combat. The chainsword retains the exact same combo from the first game, which is a welcome change, but the combat system surrounding it is different. Executions no longer directly repair Health, but instead give you one pip of armor, and contested Health.

So your total health pool has non-regenerating Health and regenerating Armor. In SM1 it worked much like Halo, where the armor was a separate bar that regens after a small amount of time. In SM2, the armor is divided into 'pips', each one a set amount of HP. Before the Sept. 29, 2024 patch, each chaff enemy would hit you for one pip of armor. So if you are hit twice, you are now bleeding non-recoverable health damage. Now, they just do damage as if you are hit by anything else.

Executions now regenerate armor, usually 1-2 pips depending on difficulty. You can also regenerate armor via parrying. Yes, there's now parrying and parry windows in this game, marked by a big blue indicator. Red indicators, you must dodge, with an i-frame dodge. And one top of that, if you recently took Health damage, you can deal damage back to regen contested health. Oh, and if you stun enemies, you can also do a gunstrike that deletes chaff and staggers bigger targets with a 1-pip armor regen and no i-frames.

This is like a weird mix of Bloodborne and SM1, and requires a bit of practice and old-habit deletion to get down, but once you're in the flow, it's a wonderful time. The power fantasy has shifted from 'I can just walk all over Orkz with ease' to 'I can dodge, shoot, duck, weave, and destroy 'nids with skill.' It's fun!

Oh, and like the first game, the Meltagun / Melta Rifle is goated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They fixed the amd crash so.
Glory to the Emperor!

Ok so, after 40 hours playing mostly operations I still recomend the game with some caveats.

The campaign is amazing.

The difficulty pushing in OPS tho is retarded.
There are so many problems with difficulty that has been written by me and DodoSwarm on the offical forums I will just link the thread.



Bottom line is difficulty needs heavy tweaking or there has to be an economy added for armory data/requisition.

If you are not into ball busting difficulty (like inferno on diablo 3 release), but want to progress and not satisfied with PVP and Campaign offerings don't buy it.
Operations higher difficulty is a mess.


Update: I am now farming ruthless consistently so don't mind the last couple of pharagrahs.

I hope this bad review can let you know one thing, don't take away the performance players already have in PVE games.
If you think the game is too simple, you can add new difficulty to strengthen the enemy.
If you think the game content is not enough, you can increase the work of the game.
If there is a bug that does not conform to the logical algorithm, you can fix the bug.
But you choose to weaken the abilities that players already have, so I can only give you this bad review.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

People gave this game a ton of credit for being well optimized and looking good, but there is a lot missing here.

weapon variety, enemy variety, ramping up difficulty in combat, powering up/adding skills all REALLY lacking.

Combat is OK, melee is ONE (1) button, and feels a little float-y and doesn't have much ""punch"" you kind of just glide through enemies without resistance (outside of executions). parry/dodge/counter works sometimes, doesn't feel consistent. You end up getting staggered, stun locked, or stuck in a reload way to often. It's often not clear why you've taken damage or from where. The input/output in combat just feels kinda weird.

You have to push the SAME button 5000 times, whether an elevator or some other interaction with the environment, it's the same asset. Never a puzzle, or a different way to ""activate"" whatever needs to be activate. Clearly cut corners here.

Cut scenes, pretty good. Some odd points where it feels like a set piece should go fade to black and back in instead. Seems they rushed in several spots.

Story, bare bones but fine. Didn't utilize one of the best-developed fantasy worlds in all of fiction. Voice acting is excellent, and so is the writing though.

.

Other games do what this game should, but better. Helldivers II has better combat. This game takes a lot influence from DOOM, but doesn't execute as well: guns lack punch, glory kills are less rewarding, you have to pause to pick up ammo, mis-calibrated resource scarcity, too many 1 shot horde enemies, too little variety besides ""more"" enemies and no coordination among them.

Overall, it's ok. Not mad I bought it. But could have just watched the cut scenes on youtube and skipped the gameplay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far I've finished the campaign and I'm playing through the Operations (Multiplayer Coop) with some friends. There are good aspects to this game. The campaign was overall not too bad, there was some good spectacle, and as someone who isn't super involved with Warhammer 40K, I thought that it felt like a good dip into the universe. Voice acting and presentation is good.

The downside is that there is a lot of really bizarre design choices. For a game based around Ultramarines and Space Marines that are genetically engineered soldiers that live for centuries fighting endless wars, it generally seems like you're wearing armour weaker than paper mache. The design goal was that your armour (Contempt) regenerates through executions of enemies, and once you're out of armour, you lose health, and it does not regenerate. The goal isn't bad, but the execution (pun intended) is. You're supposed to prevent constant damage intake and prolonging your survival by doing consistent perfect parries to trigger Gun shot finishers on minor enemies or do enough damage to major enemies to trigger an execution. The problem is that the Perfect parry seems to get easily confused if two enemies attack you at once, and even if you were to parry one, it might react to another one and you end up doing nothing instead. You can also, easily, get staggered repeated by enemy melee hits, even from minor enemies, that means if you do a properly timed parry but the game gets confused on which enemy you're parrying, you can get staggered and lose all your armour, and on higher difficulties all of your HP too, in mere seconds. The Gun shot executions that restore a full armour chunk also don't make you invincible like standard executions do, so doing one is actually going to kill you if you have literally anything near you.

That's a lot for just one mechanic, so let's rally off some other quick things. When parrying you can animation lock yourself if it's timed poorly, the red counter mechanic can often leave very little opportunity to evade, the Heavy class cannot easily evade while aiming down sights despite NEEDING to aim down sight to effectively fire, the Heavy has basically no melee weapon in a game designed around melee'ing for survival, If you have a weapon that is ""block"" based and removes Perfect Parry it still tries to Perfect Parry anyway so if you try to Blue Counter an enemy and it dies (from team mates) you end up doing the attempted perfect parry animation and locking yourself into getting hit for no reason.

Let's talk about some of the perks for weapons and characters in the game next. While I had insane respect that the devs have most of the game based around small damage numbers since most games get severely imbalanced very quickly because everything does 42 billion damage and becomes incomprehensible.

However, they designed perks with huge numbers in mind, rather than small. The Bolt Pistol does 2 damage per shot at the beginning and does 9 damage with it's highest damage Artifact variant. The mods on the weapon that increase the damage are things like ""10% more damage to Tyrmanids."" So, less than 1 extra damage at Max upgrades and 0.2 damage at lowest upgrade (when you get this perk.) Most perks have bizarre, low percentage figures like this. Or have timed bonuses that make no sense. Again, Bolt Pistol has a perk where when you Perfect Parry an enemy, you get 25% damage for 5 seconds. So 0.5 (2 at max rank) damage for 5 seconds. This seems really underwhelming considering you'd have to play for quite awhile to unlock some of this stuff. If you want to have a risk/reward system why not make it 100% damage for 10 seconds? Or if you want to encourage a specific playstyle, after a gun shot execution you gain double damage for 10 seconds. Something to encourage the player to be in that situation.

Class perks are all over the place. Some perks are completely worthless, while others are actually pretty decent. Like Bulwark's level 9 Signature ability. When you lose all your armour you drop a shock grenade. Cooldown is 120 seconds. 2 full minutes for something that can happen a half dozen times, and the shock grenades don't even do that much for you considering their small zone.

Do I think this game is good? Yes, the campaign was very cool.

Do I think that some of the weapons are awesome to use and help you fill specific roles well? Absolutely. Between weapons like the Power Sword, the Las Rifle, the Warhammer, the Heavy Bolter, and so on, you can bring swift glory to the emperium.

But do I think you should play anything past the story campaign right now? No, not a chance. The main campaign is a brief 10 hours and none of your weapons or unlocks affect your campaign so I can't think of any reason why you'd want to waste the time.

Wait for patches to fix the weapon upgrade system and all of the severely underwhelming classes and perks, as well as balance the enemies properly, and the difficulties for the campaign.

It's not that it's unplayable, but it's not very fun once you do the higher difficulties. Or at least it's not fun for very long if you aren't a hardcore Warhammer person, and even my friends I'm playing with are big fans and are struggling to enjoy the game. I think Fat Shark could really lend a hand here for Saber Interactive on the multiplayer aspect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having just finished the game i am of two minds about it:

The Good: It builds on the first game and does a great job of making you feel like a space marine. Your powerful and hit like a truck, it is friendly to the lore and brings the world of 40k to life. I have seen some reviews talking about the first half of the game being the worst part and i have to disagree. The first half of the game defending worlds from tyranids is amazing and exciting. Watching a whole swarm descend on a guarded position as you, your brothers and the scared guardsmen hold the line is great.

And now here is where the bad comes in:

The second half of the game feels like a rehash of the first game. It feels like they just wanted to have you fight chaos for pretty much no reason other than you did it in the first game. This is a issue as it left me wanting more, you just seemingly wipe the nids and chase chaos and to me this was boring. When they showed there would be three worlds to fight on i was expecting a long story where i am jumping from world to world dealing with its attackers and i feel this is what saber should have done. It should have been you fighting the nids on one world whilst chaos attacks another and a 3rd faction the other and then have them merge. But instead its simply hey you seemingly dealt with the nids now go fight chaos for the last act.

Overall i recommend it if you are a fan of 40k or the first game as it does fill the need of 40k fun and that fun from the first game. Just dont expect it to fill you at the current moment roughly 2 days of playing and i have finished the story on veteran i expected more saber. Hopefully a DLC will come out with more missions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game is great. The Atmosphere, how well it does at immersing you into the story as you fight hordes of Tyranids - OR take the fight into the eternal battle to destroy the heretics.

The game style takes some time to get used to, if you're not accustomed to playing this style of game. There are definitely some problems with it at launch, but what game doesn't have problems at launch now a days.

The PvP is fun, and I can see it growing as they continue to release content with the game. The PvE is fantastic, and I look forward to seeing where the devs take it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This isnâ€™t just a game; itâ€™s a pilgrimage into the grimdark glory of Warhammer 40K, where every bolter shot sings praises to the Emperor and every Tyranid screams in regret for ever invading the galaxy. You donâ€™t play as a Space Marine â€?you ascend to one, crushing heretics and xenos alike with the elegance of a chainsword tearing through alien flesh.

The setting? A masterpiece of gothic despair, where every ruin and skull (so many skulls!) reminds you that the galaxy hates you â€?and you're here to hate it right back. Tyranids swarm like they own the place (spoiler: they donâ€™t), and Chaos whispers temptations you answer with righteous ultraviolence.

Graphics? So good itâ€™s practically a heretical experience. My PC now has a Machine Spirit that groans every time I boot it up. Gameplay? Itâ€™s like the Codex Astartes came to life and gave you a chainsword, saying, â€œGo forth and do the Emperorâ€™s work.â€?
Flaws? Just one: I canâ€™t shout FOR THE EMPEROR loud enough to match the carnage on-screen. But thatâ€™s not the gameâ€™s fault â€?thatâ€™s on me.

If youâ€™ve ever wanted to stand against an endless swarm of Tyranids, crack their chitinous skulls, and tell Chaos where it can shove its warp nonsense, this is your moment.

10/10 â€?would purge xenos and heretics again. The Emperor approves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am starting to hate the way they've tied health and armor systems into melee. Especially on higher difficulties it's just not feasible to regain health in certain fights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally the TE-style red/blue rings for dodges and parrys â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?suck.

I have 110 hours in the game and it was great until the last patch with all the nerfs. Some heavy hits are almost impossible to dodge (like the chaos marine's flame circle) and at times I get cornered and can't see because my camera's in the wall.

The bots are EXTREMELY BAD. Not only do they not target enemies half the time, but they have no abilities. Just have the bots copy whatever perks you have for that class at least. Enemy bots also focus attacks only on the player if you're unfortunate enough to play alone. Zoanthropes are almost impossible to kill when you have 2 bot teammates and only have a pistol and melee weapon (I was in a public game as Assault and my friend DCed and no one joined).

Instead of pulling a Helldivers move and nerfing the viable/fun weapons, make the other weapons better. The blocking perk feels useless and it takes too long to kill majoris enemies with melee weapons without a parry. As a heavy main I don't ever use the heavy plasma incinerator as it's slow, doesn't do enough damage against majoris+, heats up quick, and takes too long to charge. The other weapons fare much better, but then they nerfed the melta rifle, which I felt never did much damage to extremis+ enemies and requires you to get close while aiming, putting you at a much higher risk.

I don't get how a chaos marine can shoot me point blank as I'm slashing his face.

When choosing a mission, there should be an option to host or join a random squad.

Nerfing the Melta bomb by 70% against bosses defeats the point of it. Hitting that melta is hard and should feel very rewarding.

This game is playing out almost exactly like Helldivers did for me. It was fun, I felt badass, it was rewarding to know patterns, then they hit the game with a bunch of terrible nerfs and made the game more stress than fun and ruined the flow. I haven't played Helldivers much since and I'm starting to feel the same here. What Warhammer should do which Helldivers did right was that instead of making enemies tankier, they threw more at you. This would fit great with this game as it heavily relies on executions and fighting to get armor back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest 40k game that got tons of positive reviews before it was even released. It tells the story of how three and a half ultramarines defeated just a few million tyrranids and chaos followers. Again attached lobotomized psyker, chaos-thermo-lord-wizard, references to Lord of the Rings and, unlike the first part, not fapable IG girl.
This game, apparently, enough money, so we have:
The scenery in the game is exactly three kinds again: ruins in swamps, city, cemetery in the ruins. The only glimmer of light at the very end: the ruins of cemetery in a warp anomaly.
Enemies are also of three types: tyranids, chaosites, and demon. Though for each type are drawn special, pathos-busting animations of knocking out heresy.
Weapons compared to the tabletop redesigned just to the point of impossibility: from melta made shotgun, from laska sniper, from stormbolter dull machine gun, and from the jumping satchel evil machine unstoppable imba. And they didn't let me dabble in heavy weapons

1)The game presents genetically enhanced superhuman warriors as ordinary overgrown men in sealed lats.
2)Almost the entire game, while in the combat zone, the protagonists walk around without helmets (Strictly forbidden by the Codex Astartes). The phrase of the captain (!) of the Ultramarines (!!!) addressed to the sergeant â€œWhy do you take the Codex Astartes so seriously?â€?is tantamount to breaking the oath of some Creed regiment.
3)The aforementioned captain, fighting with weapons the average SM would be ashamed of, in armor less flashy than the sergeant next to him.
4)Royals in bushes the size of a necron tomb.

However, in general, game came out not bad and even much more lore-friendly than 3rd DoW

It's pretty good, definitely not perfect as it comes with some flaws but it's a well done sequel to the first game.

Visuals
Game's visual aspect looks great, especially considering the absolute chaos you see happening on the screen with so many enemies swarming and things blowing up, with even small attention to detail existing such as the fact you get mud stains on your armour (and blood ofc) as you go through some of the marshy parts of the planet, it looks damn good but due to performance being somewhat shoddy, up scaling is needed which softens the image so people who can't stand temporal softness to an image will not be happy

Optimizaiton








I played through it solo on Veteran, my initial experience was a bit Luke-warm with the first few missions but it didn't take long for me to get more into it, especially since the campaign gets better as you progress it, early missions have this more frequent re-occurring issue that is present when you're playing solo, where certain segments feel like they're not meant for you to be on your own with the two AI partners that share a singular brain cell, such as for an example having to use a flame thrower to push back a swarm of tiny lil' insects whilst dealing with lots of ranged enemies and having to complete some objectives, problem is, the flamer takes you primary weapon away so all you're down to is your pistol for ranged enemies plus enemies in solo mode tend to focus more on the solo player than the two AI partners, so these situations can feel a bit bad . However , this starts becoming less so of a problem at the mid point of the campaign where it starts feeling like they put some more thought into making it more enjoyable when playing solo. The campaign as a whole is really damn good by the end, apart from some stumbles in design where it can very much feel like it's a Co-Op campaign with an optional solo mode from time to time, it's epic, doesn't over stay its welcome , ends on a pretty satisfying note with a spectacular final act fight that was incredibly kick a**.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Edit: there's been 3 updates to the game since my review, and all they did was Nerf everything people found viable or fun. Awesome don't even bother it just shows how lazy and incompetent these developers are, the little hope I had for this game is gone along with 80+% of the players a month after release.

I hate to leave a negative review as the game has some good qualities to it and I was excited for it, but I'm a little disappointed, it's not as perfect as people make it out to be. A lot of the issues seemed to be overlooked or not talked about. I can only hope they make changes and that it improves, as there's a lot of potential and I want it to be better.
Everything I talk about will be for PVE since I don't care for PVP. I played 2 matches and it felt like destiny 2 which sucks ballsack.
I don't really know where to begin I guess positives-
The campaign felt and played good and the customisation is good and the overall setting, atmosphere, and presentation and the monetization.
now everything else-
Most of the classes in operations, except for 1 or 2 out of the 6 feel underwhelming and unbalanced, and donâ€™t feel like you are playing as a Space Marine. One of the two exceptions I mentioned is the Heavy class he feels great to play from the start, the other I've heard gets better is Tactical. The only reason I haven't played him is that there's no reason to when heavy can do everything and you shouldn't need to spend 10 to 15 hours maxing out a class just for it to feel as fun or competent as Heavy. the other classes need to be buffed to feel more on par with Heavy rather than Heavy getting nerfed. The other classes just don't compare and feel weak which Space Marines shouldn't.
A lot of the weapons and class perks are lackluster/superficial and give the illusion of choice, most classes are pigeonholed into specific weapons and perks and only have 1 viable primary. All classes with access to pistols and melee should have the ability to use all pistols and the knife/chainsword. Not that melee matters or is worthwhile at higher difficulties It's just not fun, Heavy doesn't use melee and is easily the most enjoyable I'm not even going to talk about how useless/restricted Assault is. Maybe bringing back health gain from executions like in the first game could improve gameplay. As for the perks you are always going to pick the ones that give you more ammo and health due to how scarce it is in higher difficulties which you need to play if you want to progress / have more fun. So there's no meaningful choices / variety or builds to be made
Speaking of difficulties, they feel arbitrary and poorly designed. As you go higher you get fewer heals, heal for less, less ammo, fewer grenades. Enemies become tankier bullet sponges and they deal more damage. It's not challenging it's just frustrating not being able to do anything. Difficulties shouldn't feel like a poverty slider that makes you weaker instead there should be more and bigger enemies and maybe deal more damage and tighten parry windows. Most of the missions are monotonous and time-consuming, so overall the replayability is very limited when there's only a couple viable weapons and classes there's no reason to use the others.
All of that is ignoring the server issues desyncing and causing other players to fly, the enemies shooting through walls and matchmaking problems, the AI being terrible and bugging out, progress being lost/reset which should be fixed in time. Some small things like the UI why is there no option to delete created armour and colour presets?, Why are settings being reset or not saved? It feels like my audio settings and motion blur are being reset every time I launch, and there should be options to disable some of the annoying visual effects like vignette and change FOV instead of resulting to mods.
Anyway it's not an awful game but I don't think it's worth $60-$100 maybe wait for it to drop a third in price or until they fix or rebalance everything and add whatever content they have planned as currently its lacking content and any replayability. I just hope the people excessively praising the game and ignoring issues realize that they are doing more harm than good. The classes, melee, difficulty levels, operations and rewards need rebalancing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No one will see this review anyway, but while you're waiting for it to download to your HDD, you can make a double Krabby Patty from Sponge Bob.
You will need:
burger buns - 1
Roasted pork-beef patty - 1
Lettuce leaf - 1
Cheese slices - 1
Red onion
Tomato, about 0.7 diameter from the bun - 3 slices
Any kind of ketchup will do, however I used Heinz.
You can also choose any type of mustard.
Pickles - 5 small slices.
The order of the burger kraft is as follows:
Bottom of the bun;
The patty;
Salad;
Cheese;
Onion;
Tomato;
Ketchup;
Mustard;
Pickles;
Top of the bun

""Have an ultrawide monitor? Get f u c k e d."" -Space Marine 2 devs.

After waiting one month after launch to get ultrawide ""support"" the devs put in this half-assed ultrawide update where you're basically looking through telescope. 0 effort at all went into this. Get motion sickness because your character's legs are chopped off and the screen ends right above the head? Better just swallow that vomit according to the devs.

Patch 4.0 is out and still getting weinered down by the devs. They haven't even made a statement on how ass it is or replied to any question/comment about it. Amazing how games over a decade old work on ultrawide as intended. Save your money if you have an ultrawide monitor, the devs don't care about you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Se fan di Warhammer 40k Ã¨ un must have, altrimenti mh... magari sotto i 30 euro, perchÃ¨ il combattimento Ã¨ divertente e diverso da altri TPS col suo sistema di parry, schivate e combo, perÃ² rimane il fatto che se l'estetica non ispira il gameplay non farÃ  certo cambiare opinione. La storia mi Ã¨ piaciuta un sacco, le missioni coop post-storia sono molto carine," un Darktide un po' piÃ¹ """"semplice""""", ed il pvp Ã¨ divertente (ma da non prendere troppo seriamente). Considerando che i dev hanno detto aggiungeranno altri contenuti direi che per il prezzo (45 euro su instant gaming) Ã¨ stato un buon affare...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the few games worth full price in awhile IMO. If the game had another month or two in the oven I feel it would have been next to perfect at launch bug wise. Balancing of weapons needs some work currently, but that's an easy fix. Just please don't go the helldivers route and nerf everything that is decent.

Best way I can describe the game is ""Refreshing"".

Beautiful game, but the combat feels unintuitive and parry/execution animations gets you surrounded and slows you down.
Game could have been great but it feels like nobody actually tested the combat mechanics before release.
Using a bolter is pointless unless you go into â€œheavy stance/aim-modeâ€?and if you do you are slowed down and punished for it.

TLDR: itâ€™s a clicker game with fancy graphics. Melee is the only thing you will use to actually kill something.

Le jeu est bien, pas incroyable mais Ã§a n'a jamais Ã©tÃ© son but.
Pourquoi je ne le recommande pas alors ?
La campagne n'a rien d'exceptionnel et est assez courte, un peu dommage pour un jeu qui est avant tout solo, en disons... 9h le campagne est terminÃ©.

Comment justifier le prix alors ?
Et bien, le multijoueur qui est... passable...
Le mode PVE qui est en rÃ©alitÃ© le truc le plus original n'a que 6 missions diffÃ©rentes ce qui est vraiment dommage.
Le systÃ¨me de progression est correcte mais un peu trop long Ã  mon goÃ»t.
Pas de possibilitÃ© de crÃ©er de partie privÃ© et SURTOUT, vous allez en quitter des parties, il y a 6 classes et pas de doublons.
En gros vous allez prier que personne n'ai dÃ©jÃ  pick la classe que vous voulez.
C'est dÃ©jÃ  vraiment chiant mais en plus il fallait que le matchmaking soit tout simplement inexistant, il n'y en a juste pas.
Vous allez souvent rejoindre une partie qui a dÃ©jÃ  commencÃ© sans possibilitÃ© de le choisir ou non, et en plus vous allez souvent vous faire kick pour x ou y raion, bref c'est frustrant.

Le gameplay en lui-mÃªme maintenant.
Un tps classique, en rÃ©alitÃ© assez dÃ©cevant pour un jeu WH40k, le feeling des armes est pas lÃ , il y a au total une quinzaine d'armes je dirai, mais en rÃ©alitÃ© seulement quelques une sont viables, on passera les milles et unes variante de bolter inutiles.
Le bolter d'ailleurs, parlons-en, il ne fait juste pas de dÃ©gÃ¢t, obligÃ© de vider un chargeur de 45 coups pour tuer un monstre de base, avec un total de seulement 5 chargeurs...
Vous voyez venir le problÃ¨me, on se retrouve quasiment tout le temps Ã  court de munition, ce qui casse Ã©normÃ©ment le fun.
Le corps Ã  corps maintenant, de mon cÃ´tÃ©, je dirai que Ã§a passe mais c'est loin d'Ãªtre fun Ã  jouer, contrairement Ã  SM1 ici pas de rÃ©gen de vie et impossible d'annuler en coup, en bref, vous jouerez seulement avec les parades 90% du temps car le CÃ C n'est juste pas une option viable vu que les mobs vous explosent au CÃ C.
Les capacitÃ©s des classes qui sont mais alors pas fun du tout en dehors de l'Ã©tendard, et l'arbre de talent qui n'en n'est pas vraiment un, c'est juste des passifs qui se dÃ©bloque au fur et Ã  mesure mais qui ne change absolument rien au gameplay.
Du style, votre arme principale inflige 10% de dÃ©gÃ¢t supplÃ©mentaire... Loin mais alors trÃ¨s loin d'une personnalisation de classe comme Ã  la Darktide qui est pourtant assez simple.
On est loin de ce que peut offrir un Deep Rock avec les Overclock qui sont ultra fun.

Mention nÃ©gative spÃ©ciale pour les vagues d'ennemies, je m'explique, dans chaque mission on a une phase oÃ¹ il faut dÃ©fendre un lieu contre des vagues d'ennemis, sauf que, contrairement Ã  un World War Z oÃ¹ c'est satisfaisant car les zombies arrivent dans des quelques chemins, ici les monstres arrivent d'absolument partout, on est quasiment instantanÃ©ment au CÃ C, y a pas de ligne de dÃ©fense et c'est ultra frustrant.

En rÃ©sumÃ©, SP2 est un bon jeu, mais loin d'Ãªtre satisfaisant, je ne ressens pas le fun qu'un Darktide peut procurer pour un jeu qui est un swarm shooter. TrÃ¨s vite rÃ©pÃ©titif et cumulÃ© avec un gameplay assez plat on se fait vite chier.
Je n'ai Ã©videmment citÃ© que les points nÃ©gatifs pour moi, bien qu'il y ait des choses que j'ai apprÃ©ciÃ© du style l'animation ou la personnalisation au niveau de l'apparence, ce n'est clairement pas suffisant pour bien notÃ© le jeu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Die Storykampagne ist sehr nett gemacht, aber mit 8 Stunden viel zu kurz. Dazu noch ein paar EinsÃ¤tze mit PvE-Inhalten zum Grinden und dann bleibt noch PvP, was ich persÃ¶nlich nicht mag. Die Kampfmechaniken sind sehr einfach gehalten, halten aber fÃ¼r kurze Zeit bei Laune. Ich wÃ¼rde auf eine Sale warten und dann stimmt Preis/Leistung.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patch 3.0 made it impossible to play this in any online mode from Linux, including a Steam Deck.

UPDATE: After the hotfix, it's possible to play this online again on Linux and avoid getting the AVF connection error by putting ""Steamdeck=1 %command%"" in the launch options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do not waste your money on this game. It was fine until this recent patch. The game crashes on me and others and I'm very seriously thinking about asking for a refund. I tired of making it to bosses at the end of a mission and the game freezes and then crash before I can complete the mission. Other games with these sort of issues shut their games down until issues like these are resolved. Them not shutting it down until it's fixed is just making more and more people upset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Juegardo, recuerdo que hace meses me compre este ordenador para poder jugarlo (tenÃ­a un portÃ¡til tostadora) y por ahora no he tenido ningÃºn problema. No entiendo por que otras tantas personas tienen problemas de optimizaciÃ³n. Mi grÃ¡fica es una 3060 y genial...no se si serÃ¡ mala suerte, o les va mal porque no cumplen los requisitos pero que yo sepa estamos jugando al mismo juego y como dije todo bien salvo por el Ãºnico problema que es con los servers, nada de atascos ni pantallazos por parte del juego en si.

Solid enough game - it does what it says on the tin - be a giant super human and smack bugs around. Story seems fun so far, operations are good (but with a caveat) and I like the melee and gunplay. After some more time in the game (both story and operation) I can delve a bit deeper into things.

Story - 7/10. It's pretty straight forward, though there might be a twist or turn in there (that I'm sure you have already gotten spoiled through various news media anyway). Not much to say. Simple, but cool.

World building - 10/10. Top marks. The maps, the battlefields, the chaos, the swarms, the absolute gore - it's just fantastic. It's beautiful and disturbing and just beyond anything I expected. Game teaches you about the 40k world and the immersion it provides gets you really stuck into it making you want to know more.

Gameplay - 9/10. Gameplay is marvelous. Though I'm still struggling with the timing of dodges and parries I've occasionally gotten in a flow where I just become a blender, chopping xeno scum to the left, doding xeno scum to the right, and firing of headshots as quick reaction. I for sure need to get better at the combat flow, but I can easily see how good it can be if you get good at it and once you do it's going to be euphoric.

Operations - 8/10, but with a caveat. The mainstay of the game in my opinion. It has huge potential and even the little I've played is so much fun. It reminds me of the golden days of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer (if you know, you know). However the biggest issue is playing without a full team - because you are stuck trying to connect with random players and that is it's own bag of worm. From people with bad connection, to people who won't go to the mission area, to people who just afk. I honestly prefer having bots over the random players, but unfortunately you can't choose to add bots - you have to hope nobody tries to join. The fact that we can't add bots makes me want to subtract 2 points from the score on it's own because the issues with random players can be very aggravating. They need to add an option to add bots..

Endless War - haven't played =p Might try it some day, but not a big PvP so - check others opinion on this game mode.

Would I recommend? I think, yes. If you enjoy the concept of loop gameplay from operations, and you have a full team (or the devs add option to add bots) I think you will have a blast. I know I will once I'm done with the random player issues.

Oh, and a final note. Stay away from the ultimate edition and cosmetic DLC's and all that. Even if you pay for it you still have to unlock it. So you buy for the right to unlock the cosmetics, but you still have to spend requisition on it which takes super long to grind. My biggest regret is paying for the ""cosmetic options"" I don't have enough points to unlock lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Review has been edited to reflect the recent changes made at time of writing. To see the original negative review, check the bottom of this review.

Well I'll be damned. They actually managed to dial back enough changes to make the game a blast to play again. Combined with the new buffs to bolt weapons and friendly AI damage against bosses, I can safely say that this game has earned its place back among my go-to games to play. I still have a few gripes, like how the AI uses its abilities (or doesn't) at inconvenient times, but they are ultimately outweighed by the enjoyment of the game-play itself. I can't wait for the new weapon and what else is to come in the future. As long as they aren't updates like Patch 4.



Original review:

I used to love this game to bits, and the Operations mode was something I would play daily. However, the recent patch has made the mode practically unplayable on higher difficulties. Many minutes are wasted by slogging through a mission with wave upon wave of Warriors spamming projectiles at me, only to die near the end when the game decides I don't deserve to be rewarded for my time and kills me by sending 15 Warriors and a pair of Zoanthropes.

Helldivers 2 showed you how badly you can â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up a game when you decide to make it harder when it is already plenty difficult, and Saber Interactive decided to follow it as a tutorial. Ironically, Helldivers 2 is now it a better position than this game, and so I may decide to spend my time with it instead. Very disappointing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Product received for free

Early negative review: seems like if Gear of War if it didn't have a shred of humanity, and looked really good. It's middling in a lot of ways, and the one way it is exceptional is that it is like Zoolander: really really really ridiculously good looking.

Graphically demanding, and while it runs fairly well, it has an upscaling menu that bears some dire implications for the future of graphics (AI upscaling presented as balanced option, native resolution presented as ultra-premium quality option).

Overheats your PC for fairly basic gameplay. Guns are good, slightly underwhelming, melee is a very lightweight system with a dash of Arkham and not particularly deep. Could be that it gets better, but I'm not in any hurry to find out. Once again, it feels like Gears of War but with the armor system replacing the cover system. Not in love with the tone, it's very self-serious and dire and slow, and you run into a lot of characters that are just so flat and one dimensional. Not much popcorn appeal there, but it's also hard to take with any gravitas since the game is just about big silly action figures ripping apart lizards.

It also lacks the mortality and urgency of Gears characters, since space marines are basically invincible superheroes in their universe walking past expendable nameless IG that they'd be willing to sacrifice without a second's hesitation. Grim, serious (verging on joyless) invincibility fantasy is just an odd wavelength to try and play along with in a basic TPS.

Verdict: I wish I was playing Vanquish (2010) instead!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I preordered the 100-euro version after knowing that Saber had some ex-Bungie employees, and oh boy do I not regret it. Some of that classic Halo DNA must be in this game, because I wasnâ€™t so hooked with and online PvE mode since the original Halo ODST firefight mode.

Without taking into account the excellent campaign mode (LEAD ME TO THE SLAUGHTER) and the PvP, Iâ€™ve already sink +100 hours playing Operations Mode in all difficulty levels. Each time you finish an operation, you get points, new armor, weapons, perks and more. With 6 classes and their distinct playstyles to level up, the amount of content included in the base game is insane, every post-match customization had me building different Space Marines of all aesthetics, colors, chapters and combinations imaginable.
Since I started playing, I went to my familyâ€™s house to retrieve my old 40k minis (Black Templars and Tyranids, very appropriate), read +5 novels (The End and the Death and the Ravenor trilogy), visited my local Games Workshop retail store (first time since I was 16), and purchased and started painting some new Black Templar units (the whole Primaris upgrade is new to me, the minis are quite bigger).

So yeah, this game is just that good, totally recommended if you want to re-enter or experience for the first time the grim dark gothic future W40K has to offer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really thought this game would be different. I thought developers would have learned their lessons from HellDivers II. But here we are. The game was great. I agree it could have used a harder difficulty. But instead, they messed with all of the difficulties. They buffed the enemies, nerfed us, and made the game a chore to play. I don't understand why developers think their game should be a chore to play. They had such a good game, and they just ruined PVE. Thanks.

Simply put: This game is extraordinary. Not only is it visually stunning and highly immersive, it is a game made for the target audience through and through. Loved every minute and can't wait for more after 9 hrs of play.

The story is rich, the characters are well done, and the atmosphere is palpable throughout the campaign. More than anything else though: Space Marine 2 is a game that makes me feel like I was heard. The game stays true to the core of 40k and incorporates much of the existing lore into an amazing rendition of that world.

The combat system takes some getting used to but it is akin to Helldivers and Gears of War blended with a somewhat ""Souls-like"" play style. Dodging, timed strikes and blocks, run gunning, and simply brute force are all options. Different combat strategies are rewarded differently with different enemy types and I enjoyed the challenge. On Veteran difficulty you absolutely have to be more careful and consider what enemies you are fighting our else you will get absolutely mogged. The combat is addictive and exactly what I think of when I read a 40k book. The flashlights are also fairly lore accurate which is awesome haha.

I highly recommend this game:

Pros:
-Fantastic landscape and world design. Highly rich environments with stunning visuals and details
-Plays fantastic. The combat system works great with minimal bugs and the game appropriately rewards strategy
-True to the lore and ties in nicely with the original game
-Very palpable passion in the writing and development. This game was made for true 40k fans and new fans alike. It leaves you excited to play again.
-Great PvP and PvE coop options

Cons:
-Audio bugs for me have been most common. Muffled audio randomly after cutscenes or death is my most frequent bug but even then are not persistent and resolved with rebooting the game.
-I wish the campaign was a smidge longer. I got a solid 8hrs out of my first playthrough on veteran, and I stopped to look at things and explore the NPCs conversations as I went. This is somewhat made-up for in the coop mission mode.
-Some of the enemies are serious bullet sponges and when playing solo campaign the enemies tend to target you far more than your NPC allies. Normally this would be ok, but when cooping the enemies target everybody in a more balanced way and that did make the missions more enjoyable simply because the mobs don't drown you in harass on top of tougher enemies.

There are also some obvious areas where the game can be expanded, and I really look forward to it.

I have not yet played the PvP heavily but in the brief time I did try it I enjoyed it.

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you are a 40k fan this game is worth every penny of full price. If you are a Helldivers/Gears of War/Halo fan you will probably love it too, and this game makes a decent into to 40k but you will have to google some things (Such as Space Marine structuring and who the Emperor is, but don't worry YouTube is rich in lore vids).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A visceral, simple Warhammer 40,000 experience that is presented as a simple game you can just pick up and play, albeit knowing at least a bit of the story of the first game is very helpful.

Combat has weight and impact to it, the marines look good, the tyranids are relentless and the corridors and areas feel atmospheric. I mainly have small complaints like that bolters could have a little more punch to their sounds, blocking being a little confusing at the beginning and the menus being annoying to navigate with a controller as the cursor slows down A LOT on some UI elements but it sure does feel good to just have a game you can just play for fun without much modern nonsense in the way of just playing it. I'm also enjoying the photo mode.

I do have one big complaint already which is that while playing the campaign alone I almost lost one fight due to lag. Felt really odd and kind of sad that otherwise such an awesome fight was rubberbanding severely.

This game is certainly not heresy for the license. FOR THE EMPEROR!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Product received for free

I never expected a sequel to one of my guilty pleasure games but I'm so happy it exists! This game is such a huge improvement to the first one. The story was so fun and soooo sick. The addition of easy drop-in, drop-out for co-op was fantastic. Visuals were wayyy better than I expected and might be one of the nicest looking games I've ever played (at the time of this writing? lmao).
The only gripe I have is with the lack of information presented for pvp. It took quite a while to get into my first match and I had no idea if I was actually gonna get in since it gave me no indication besides ""Waiting for other Battle Brothers"" in a full lobby. Turns out I was waiting for the match that I joined to end... I think. It would also be nice to have one sentence explaining each of the pvp modes. Switching armor parts instead of choosing a chapter was also confusing.
Other than that, I loved playing through the story, can't wait to get the squad together for Operations, and I'm super happy this game exists!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

melee combat here is just a piece of sh//t, yes itâ€™s bloody, spectacular finishing moves but thatâ€™s all, transitions between levels are just tailored for online co-op, you just appear in the arena and go extinguish the same enemies with the same thing, the battles are crooked , except for the plot and graphics there is nothing, the game is just a very average level",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I Like it but thats not the whole story..
Space Marine 2 is well set in the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K. As a continuation of the OG Space Marine Game from 2011, it attempts to bring the one-decade old formula of bolter shooting and chainsawsword slashing to 2024. However, it struggles to do so and is very expensive on top. I really enjoy playing the game and will most likely cotinue to play it. But it has some notable flaws and if you are thinking about buying the game you should consider the following.


If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k and a sucker for the (totally not overrepresented) Ultra Marines, its a awesome implementation in the Universe.
The game is a well representation (even if a little generalized) of the lore and atmosphere that makes up the core of 40k for me. It allows you to stomp Tyranids and match yourself with . In the Coop PVE and the PVP mode, the Customization System allows you to tailor your Character into your favorite Space Marine Chapter or Chaos Legion. The Lovecraftian horrors of the 40k universe are well-represented, making the story engaging despite its somewhat bleak plot and dialogue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, if you're not deeply invested in the 40k Universe, Space Marine 2 falls short. The gameplay feels outdated, with clunky mechanics that haven't evolved much since the original game . Combat can be fun, but it's often repetitive and lacks the refinement seen in other smilar modern titles. The writing is another weak point, with dialogue that ranges from uninspired to outright poor. Online multiplayer is plagued by long wait times, frequent connection errors, and bugs that, for example, can make enemies invisible (very fun), breaking immersion and gameplay. The game has a very hard time to offer anything beyond its niche appeal, making its steep tag hard to justify for newcomers to the world of 40K aswell as casual players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Space Marine 2 delivers exactly what I want out of a Warhammer 40k game: a grimdark experience in a universe that lacks hope with the permanent thread of extinction for a human race lost in endless external and internal conflict. However, it struggles to appeal beyond its core audience due to outdated gameplay, technical issues, and blunt writing. If you're a diehard fan of 40k, you'll find enjoyment in this game despite its flaws. For everyone else, who just want to stomp some Aliens and blow up stuff, there are better and less expensive options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pour l'empereur.

Alors oui c'est un jeu couloir, mais en vrai Ã§a fait un bien de fou de revenir aux bases du jeu video.

Ici on est lÃ  pour du fun pur et dur. (A l'inverse d'un helldivers qui demande face aux tyranides de rester un max discrets et speed run les objectifs, alors que face aux terminators oÃ¹ il faut faire du controle de map)

Et oui les thermes sont dit.

La technologie employÃ© pour gÃ©nÃ©rer les hordes d'ennemies ne vous fera pas perdre de fps, contrairement aux effets visuels. C'est beau et important d'Ãªtre surligner.

ZÃ©ro try hard mÃªme en pvp. Je pensai faire que du pve mais le pvp est fun.

L'empereur vous invite fortement Ã  contribuer Ã  faire la bagarre, pour les plus anciens c'est un peu comme quake mais en tps.

Laissez lui sa chance et je vous promets que vous y aller vous amusez.

Et Ã§a il faut le dire car en 2024 peu de jeux peuvent prÃ©tendre le contraire.

Complete mess on launch. Didn't even make it past the first cutscene before the game:

1. Opened on the wrong monitor and blackscreened for ten minutes.
2. Twenty minutes spent on shaders deciding if they want to load or lock.
3. First cutscene locked the game up visually, forcing a restart of the previous points.

The game was loaded onto an SSD during all this. It's simply the game launching as an absolute hot, unfinished mess.

I'll consider changing my review to positive once the game is in a better state but for 60 bucks I expect a far smoother first experience than this. The industry as a whole needs to quit slashing Q&A and shoving the task on paying customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is by far my GOTY contender for 2024. I will not argue with people who don't agree for stupid reasons. The story is so stupidly incredible and epic. It fits perfectly for a Warhammer 40k game. The gameplay can at times be a little yanky and rough but is for the most part perfectly great and fun. Ripping a tyranid open from the middle and being drenched in its blood never gets old.

The operations game mode is so much fun, playing as my own space marine completing missions really is amazing. Even replaying the same missions doesn't get old.

The pvp game mode is the best pvp in any game I have ever played. I never liked playing pvp until I tried it in this game. However it is a bit unbalanced as some classes are absolute dogsh*t in pvp. Or at least on some gamemodes. I'm sure it will improve.

The customization is incredible, all that I am missing is more customization for heretic factions, which I don't doubt will come later considering how many people want it.

The only complaints for this game I have seen are: No widescreen support (Which will come to the game in september, just check the roadmap) , Oh I don't wanna connect to epic games services (Doesn't make the game bad, and is only there so you can play crossplay), The AI companions are so bad that I can't play the campaign solo (Literally a skill issue???)
This is finally a game that is not pay to win and it is clear that the devs reallly care about the game. In my eyes this game is joining baldurs gate 3 for being an actually good game in modern times. Yes some cosmetics will cost money, but all other content coming to the game is free. So people need to stop complaining about this game, because it is simply breathtaking.

In summary, this game is worth every penny. I bought Ultra Edition instead of Gold Edition even if it only gives me a cool cosmetic for Ultramarines (and I really dislike ultramarines) but I still don't regret it. I would have bought this game if it cost $150 base edition. Good that it doesn't but still, It is worth the money to me personally. Now keep in mind, I love warhammer 40k and have done for a while so I am a bit biased. But for a Warhammer 40k fan, this game is like the game of my dreams. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? BUY IT NOW! AND MARCH FOR THE EMPEROR!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bueno, no se muy bien que decir de este juego pero, una cosa estÃ¡ clara, es igual que el SM1 solo que chorromil veces mejor, es lo qeu le encantarÃ­a a cualquier fan de w40k y no fan.
El juego es entretenido, divertido, graficamente es una obra de arte, musicalmente tambiÃ©n.
Cuenta con una campaÃ±a corta pero intensa, un multijugador entretenido y un modo operaciones super guay.
No se que mÃ¡s decir, ha merecido la pena haber esperado tantos aÃ±os para ver este juego.

ONLY NEGATIVE DUE TO RECENT UPDATE. Latest Patch as of this moment broke the game for steam deck/Linux Users as we can no longer PLAY ONLINE.

The game is fun, and the progression is addicting, but 100 hours in and then suddenly the latest update rolls out and bricks the game for a fair amount of users and no official statement is BS honestly.

Just when we thought this was gonna be smooth sailing from here with the balance patch and stuff this happens.

Great game and do recommend, but if youâ€™re on linux or steam deck DO NOT GET THIS RIGHT NOW.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So the game has problems in gameplay and technical problems with audio not matching and issues with loading.
The game is well fun though its short very short for its price it should be around $60 or $55
PVP is not going to carry it nore is the PVE because there is less PVE operations than Darktide.
And when darktide has more replayability than this that's a problem.
Enemies feel like they take 1 too many shots or hits to take down and you seem squishy for a space marine.
Really it is a good attempt at a 40k game, a good attempt at Space marines very good visuals
but that is all there is looks, immersion, and just barely any gameplay, like a showcase into the 40k universe
ill probably keep it but really i doubt i would recommend it to my friends unless it was at least 50% or more off.
Sad but that's just the way games are these days. too small content wise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's been years since the first Space Marine & I was super hyped when word came out that they were doing a sequel. After playing this game for a while, I must say. It doesn't disappoint. The levels are beautiful and the combat is on another level. Its full of blood and gore to the point you feel like you have to take a shower after playing ha-ha. Fantastic game hands down & a must buy for any Warhammer fan!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dear citizens of the Imperium of Mankind, behold the best Warhammer 40k game yet.
The storyline from the first Game continues. A true miracle after 13 years. Brothers rejoice.

The main focus is on PvE though.
Spawn points change with each playthrough.
The difficulty level is also freely selectable.
If one or two players are missing, the mission can still be started and a bot will join in.
This means PvE will still be playable in a few years.

So adjustments to the Meele class would be nice, but for now I'm happy with what I have.

Great job Saber Interactive.

May the Emperor bless you and give us part 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once again, Steam could use a 'maybe' category for recommendation. This game looks and sounds beautiful. Enemies and NPCs look lore accurate, and for the most part act lore accurate, in a great way. The campaign is relatively short for the price however, and I'm really not interested in the multiplayer aspect at all.

That said, the single player would be improved greatly if the bot teammate AI was just a little better, or had a Mass Effect style order system, or even a priority target list you could set, to control where the bots focus their shooting and melee. Way too many times, the bots shoot at trash mobs, or even the small rat mobs that their guns won't even effect, instead of flying buffer enemies or any sort of real threats. They will also sometimes just lock up, seemingly overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemies running around.

Also, on Veteran difficulty and above, the guns feel ridiculously weak. You can empty your entire ammo supply, not just magazines, into some enemies and barely move their health bar, even with headshots. Also, whenever most enemies, even some borderline trash mobs die, they enter a flashing red 'Execute' state, which is useful for regaining armor in theory but less useful when dozens of them are in that state all over the map, and your AI teammates ignore them and let them heal up and reenter the fight.

The game also suffers from a DOOM style 'only one attack pattern matters' vs certain enemies, aka the dual sword wielding Tyranids, for example. If you don't counter their melee hit and then shoot them with the pistol (when a quicktime style indicator pops up), you are literally wasting time and ammo, and their 20 friends are jump stabbing you in the face and back.

The animations for melee attacks are also simply too slow, you can perfectly counter a literal half dozen swarmer enemies and kill them, and then get hit and damaged while STILL DOING the attack animation from another angle. Either make the animations WAY faster, or give some iframes in there, for playability.

The heavy bolter(full auto heavy weapon one) is great. What's not great however, is the fact that it counts as a fire and discard weapon, aka it cannot be reloaded from the many, many suspiciously placed ammo boxes all over enemy territory. That leads to another point, these are the least equipped space marines ever. Three person squads (for balance reasons according to the developers), with no medpacks on deployment, only 2-4 magazines, and a melee weapon? Also I've only had a jetpack once out of what seems to be 90% of the game so far, and no heavy weapon Space Marine squads are in sight. Only non-controllable vehicles in cut scenes.

This probably sounds overly negative, but the game is SO close to being amazing. Just better AI, more Ammo (for my shooty space marines), better kit selection before missions(medpacks, more ammo, grenade types, a heavy weapon, etc.) and it's an all time great game. It certainly looks and sounds like it already. Just a few numbers patches, or maybe eventually modders will save it.

If you play solo, look forward to rage against the braindead teammate AI, but it's probably a great game with a focused team of 3 human players.

Also, vs some of the large boss enemies, in particular Carnifex and the flying shielded caster thing... does my super mutant cyborg really take 3+ seconds to pick up a box of ammo or grenades? You are going to need to shoot these guys THOUSANDS of times, so you must scrounge ammo, and stopping to actually pick it up gets you swarmed by trash and unblockable boss attacks.

Somehow I suspect the developers won't do most of the changes I'm looking for, as this game has already sold very well. Hopefully some modders see it close to my way though!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dans une assiette creuse, dÃ©posez une demi-banane que vous rÃ©duisez en purÃ©e avec une fourchette. Si vous nâ€™Ãªtes pas un grand adepte de la saveur de la banane dans vos desserts, vous pouvez sauter cette Ã©tape, cela nâ€™impactera pas la qualitÃ© de vos brioches.

Versez par-dessus les 120 g de yaourt grec, la farine, la levure et lâ€™extrait de vanille. Si vos pÃ©pites de chocolat sont dÃ©jÃ  prÃ©parÃ©es, versez-les Ã©galement.

Sinon, coupez votre tablette en morceau Ã  la main puis Ã  lâ€™aide dâ€™un hachoir ou dâ€™un gros couteau, rÃ©duisez-les en pÃ©pites. Plus celles-ci seront grosses, plus vous obtiendrez des morceaux de chocolat fondant dans vos brioches au moment de la cuisson.

Ajoutez-les ensuite Ã  la prÃ©paration et mÃ©langez le tout. PÃ©trissez la pÃ¢te obtenue dans vos mains et divisez-la ensuite en 4 petites boules.

DÃ©posez ces boules sur une plaque allant au four recouverte de papier sulfurisÃ©. Badigeonnez-les de jaune dâ€™Å“uf Ã  lâ€™aide dâ€™un pinceau.

Puis rÃ©alisez une petite entaille sur le dessus de chaque brioche pour une meilleure cuisson.

Placez-les enfin au four chaud (180Â°C) pendant 15 Ã  20 minutes. Surveillez la cuisson, lâ€™objectif est quâ€™elles soient bien dorÃ©es !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

played :
- Dawn Of War games series, love it.
- Read the lore of warhammer 40k, holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?its grim dark, love it
- Played the 1st Space Marine game, wow its the first TPS Space marine game, love it

and now this the sequel from 1st space marine, my god how its so much better the visual, the story, everything is just perfect in my POV, as for the pvp i barely touch it i dont really care much about pvp, as for the other mode (the operation / co-op mode) its really challenging theres so much class you pick, which one is suit for you is up to u, you want to be support you got it, you want to be the all out offensive you got it, you want to be sniper picking enemy from far you got it.

though the dev could improve more on it, which i heard thats what they're doing, thats great!.

its 9/10 for me, best goty. as Asmongold said ""space marine 2 is a reminder what we lost"" a nostalgic good story driven games that are fun like back in the day Halo series, god of war, and DMC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall i have to say that in general it is a good game. It does a lot of things right. At least the launch wasn't scuffed like darktide's launch was. Plus i don't have to fiddle around with graphic settings to make it not run like the biggest laggy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?of a game i have ever seen.

Yet....there just no real substance to the game. I'm completely honest here, for a game like this. I am totally fine with the story being short (roughly 12 hours on veteran) all good.

BUT the big thing why i can't recommend is that the PvE is just so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lackluster. 6 missions ? That's just not enough at this point. To really have a good rotation you need at least 10 missions. Then the fact that some classes are heavily limited to weapons.

The idea of their difficulty scaling is literally making enemies bullet sponges.
Thats just not good enough and only ruins the game when even the useful weapons aren't enough to pose a real threat to the enemy.

I don't play PvP so i can not comment on how this aspect is.

They also have a road map that should feature a horde mode. I mean....a horde of bullet sponges ? nah bruh. Its a good idea but with the current way the difficulty scales its just not something i could see people enjoying a lot. I'd rather have 4 new operations to freshen up things plus a rework of how difficulty scales.
Mix in more majoris or make random hordes appear at some point. But don't give them more health.

Also PLEASE for the love of anything that is holy and under the protection of the emperor, the one â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thing he doesn't protect is your server connectivity. I can not tell how many times i don't even get matchmaking going and then the game tellse me that the connection is not working and if i wanna play offline. Like WHAT ?! Holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ sigmar. I am waiting longer for people to join my lobby than it takes me to finish 3 operations. How is that even possible ?

Yes we've seen all of this in other games and maybe that is not the route the devs wanna go. I am just saying that there is not enough content to make this worth while",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preordenado ustedes dirÃ¡n porque, es simple, es hora de matar a los Aliens y vengar a Ripley XD, o ser de la raza Terran de Starcraft para batalla contra los Zerg. Si quieres jugar la evoluciÃ³n del Gear of Wars que esperas para comprarlo XD.
Recomiendo compra la versiÃ³n Standard Edition, podrÃ¡s jugar la campaÃ±a, las operaciones y la guerra eterna. Desde que inicias el tutorial o intro, esto se vuelve un autÃ©ntico desmadre, aplastando, descuartizando Aliens, te darÃ¡s gusto amigo XD, jugar el intro con la dificultad Ã¡ngel de la muerte ufff es una locura, es una autentica pasada, ya luego la jugabilidad se pone heavy heavy pana, el equilibrio en los demÃ¡s mapas con la dificultad al tope, es la misma tortura de Shakira jajaja XD, mejor bajarle a normal, esta es unos de los puntos que deben mejorar, continuando cuando te dan los propulsores ufff otra vez vuelves a la vida de la destrucciÃ³n XD, eres el mismo Ã¡ngel caÃ­do XD. cuando te den la espada de energÃ­a ufff te sentirÃ¡s como todo un jedi, recomendado te divertirÃ¡s.

(POR FAVOR CREADORES tomen en cuenta esto) para la siguiente entrega
1-Agregar mas armas o que las armas se mejoren, porque la gran mayorÃ­a de armas no sirven para nada, solo necesitaras utilizar, el rifle bolter automÃ¡tico, el fusil de fusiÃ³n, la pistola bolter, de ayi en adelante las demÃ¡s armas quitando la espada de energÃ­a, lo demÃ¡s no sirve.
2-Agregar bullet time cuando rematas con la Tecla E o cuando paras con la tecla C, uff eso seria Ã©pico.
3-Agregar mas variedad de vestimenta para poder utilizar en la campaÃ±a.

Temas resueltos despuÃ©s del parche del 11 de septiembre del 2024

(Ahora si esta equilibrada)1-Equilibra la dificultad, ya que despuÃ©s de la intro, los demÃ¡s mapas estÃ¡n desequilibrados, mas sin juegas de 2 jugadores y si estas con la IA como uno de tus amigos, encomiÃ©ndate jajaj XD.
(Ahora si esta fluido el juego)2-Agregar que se mueva el personaje, que camine o corra, cuando dispara, no puede ser que se quede quieto recibiendo golpe, como si fuera una estatua.
(Ahora si se aprecia lo grÃ¡fico)3-Mejorar el renderizado al jugar cooperativo online, ya que cuando invitas a 1 amigo o 2 amigos para jugar cooperativo online, el renderizado baja o la calidad grafica del mapa baja, lo mÃ¡s loco es que si vuelve a entrar al mapa se optimiza, pero es un vaivÃ©n la calidad. (si no me equivoco por eso es que se realizara 1 parche o varios XD.
(Ahora si reacciona) 4-Optimizar o Mejorar la PARADA (Pulsas la Tecla C), contexto: cuando el enemigo se te abalanza hacia ti, sale un CÃ­rculo de Color celeste, esto debe mejorar, despuÃ©s de la intro esto debe mejorar, ya que muchas, pero muchas veces, al oprimir la tecla C, adivina no pasa absolutamente nada, quedas como autentico payaso esperando que haga la defensa que nunca hace, cuando son grupos pequeÃ±os de alienÃ­genas, se percibe mÃ¡s, pero cuando son grupos grandes, esto falla casi el 95% de las veces.

Me ha encantado la campaÃ±a del juego se puede observar una gran evoluciÃ³n de la primera entrega.
Recomiendo muchisimo si quieres mejorar la experiencia de juego usar la opciÃ³n cooperativa por que siempre sera mejor jugar con tus hermanos de batalla que solo.

Dale una oportunidad y disfruta del universo de Warhammer 40K y sigue la aventura de Titus;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Really wanted to like this game. The biggest issue is matchmaking, its completely f'ed. Been playing for 2 weeks and was hoping the new patch would fix this issue. If you que with a 2nd person you will never find a 3rd person. Its a known issue all over forums yet they just released a new patch and didn't even try fixing it. If you solo Q you might find a 2nd player, and then end up with a bot. If you play with ur friend and u have a bot as 3rd player, its going to be tough on the higher difficulties. Game doesn't have much end game content, just 4 levels and 6 separate operation missions. End game content is lacking, campaign is short, campaign you don't even get to level up or use different loadouts. The loadouts are only available in a separate mode. Gets repetitive with no real differences. But not even being able to play with battle brothers or constantly glithcing and having to play with useless bots. Whats the point of this ""brotherhood"" game when all my brothers are bots? Don't get how SABER has not even attempted to fix this issue last patch OR is aware of it!

NOV 20/2024 They fixed matchmaking not as buggy. Game is a bit easy, on the hardest level difficulty LETHAL mode, you get some skins that show you beat all of it as bragging rights or honor. For how massive the lore is for Warhammer and how epic the brotherhood is. Feels like the reward is lackluster, needs something more cooler for the achievement. Glowing helmet, or a diff color, or something, its just a scratched helmet that u can barely even see unless you are right beside a brother... Lol. Expected something much more EPIC. But that goes with the entire game, not much customizable skins, slacking IMO in 2024 time. Should be way more expansive. Pretty sure there are free games that have much more customization options compared to this massive franchise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't think I've ever been ""forced"" to leave a bad review for a game....but wow does Saber/Focus deserve it. I played the game under Proton on Linux, and enjoyed playing with my son since launch day, and was looking forward to the future of the game. Then came Patch 3.0 when the developer intentionally removed any online play for Linux users; this after the game released in a wonderful state under Proton. I've patiently waited a week, and yet not a single official word from either Saber or Focus.

I've never had a game completely pull the rug out from underneath me like this before -- I'm so happy to buy full-price games so I can support developers that release games that work well in SteamDeck/Linux (especially if that's a specific goal of theirs, Larian being a good example), but what a mistake this was. I'd happily wait longer if the dev or pub cared to even acknowledge what's happened, but they haven't. Sad really. I really regret wasting my money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ich mÃ¶chte mit dem negativen beginnen. Der PVP und der PVE Modus haben meiner Meinung nach zu wenig Missionen bzw. Maps. Bei dem PVP Modus ist dies nicht so schlimm doch bei PVE geht die Lust leider nach den 6 Missionen schnell raus. Server Probleme gab es jedoch nicht viele. Einige haben Grafikprobleme und sehen unsichtbare Charaktere wo aber dran gearbeitet wird. Ich persÃ¶nlich hÃ¤tte mir gewÃ¼nscht das man seinen Space Marine individueller gestalten kann z.B. das man Namen, Stimme und Gesicht Ã¤ndern kann.

Der Rest an dem Spiel ist sehr positiv. Das Kampfsystem macht jedes mal Bock und auf die Grafik wÃ¤re sogar der Imperator stolz da sie sogar sehr flÃ¼ssig lÃ¤uft. Interface und Audio wirken sehr gut Ã¼berarbeitet und besonders die deutsche syncro kann sich durch aus hÃ¶ren lassen. Das absolute Highlight ist meiner Meinung nach die Kampagne. An der kann ich absolut nichts kritisieren da sie viel SpaÃŸ macht und die Inszenierung mehr als gut gelungen ist.

Mehr Content ist zwar bestÃ¤tigt durch die Roadmap aber ich glaube dieser wird dauern da der Content bestimmt zeitgleich mit den Konsolen raus kommt. Wenn ihr auch PVP spielt kann euch das Game sehr lange fesseln!

Ich habe nach 10 Stunden die Kampagne durchgespielt und werde mich definitiv weiter an den anderen Spiel-Modi erfreuen. Ich bin selber kein groÃŸer Kenner des Universums, jedoch mag ich das Warhammer Franchise trotzdem, auch Warhammer Fantasy. Man muss jedoch kein Kenner sein, um das Spiel zu mÃ¶gen. Es erzÃ¤hlt eine coole Geschichte, die recht knackig gehalten ist.
Grafisch ist es einfach bombastisch. Alles wirkt over the top, wie man es von Warhammer erwarten wÃ¼rde.
Trotz das ich ""nur"" eine 3080 mit einem ryzen 9 5900x habe, lÃ¤uft das Spiel die meiste Zeit butterweich und ist sehr gut optimiert. Wer immer stabile FPS haben will, braucht hier aber schon eine 40er Karte, wenn man alles auf max spielen will.
Einziges Manko fÃ¼r mich war das Ende der Kampagne. Es war unfassbar gut inszeniert. Jedoch hat das Spiel einem hier doch etwas zu oft die Kontrolle weggenommen und war dadurch gefÃ¼hlt nur noch eine groÃŸe Cutscene.
Insgesamt jedoch ein sehr gutes Spiel und sein Geld wert und weiterer Content ist ja angekÃ¼ndigt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wait for sale
Campaign is fairly short (took us 8 hours including waiting on loading screens and connection issues)
Looks amazing, but each mission boils down to: go to a button, press a button and fight some enemies while lift/portal/whatever is opening up.
Marines do not feel that powerful, missions are just repeat of the same thing like 8 times. The game feels slightly unfinished currently, and I regret my purchase, at this moment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 Ã¨ un'esperienza coinvolgente che riesce a catturare l'immaginazione anche di chi, come me, Ã¨ un neofita nell'universo di Warhammer. Non Ã¨ necessario conoscere la lore fino in fondo per avere una totale immersione di quest'avventura: Infatti, il gioco ti trascina in un mondo oscuro e devastato, dove vestire i panni di un possente Space Marine Ã¨ un'esperienza incredibilmente gratificante.

PRO:
Gameplay fluido e appagante: Combattere le orde Ã¨ soddisfacente, con un mix bilanciato tra brutalitÃ  corpo a corpo e sparatorie adrenaliniche. L'uso delle armi e delle abilitÃ  Ã¨ molto intuitivo e non richiede meccaniche impegnative.

ModalitÃ  cooperativa: Giocare con gli amici aggiunge una nota di maggiore divertimento e strategia in piÃ¹, perfetto per affrontare le missioni piÃ¹ impegnative.

Supporto post-lancio promettente: Con una community giÃ  appassionata all'universo di Warhammer e/o players neofiti che vogliono conoscere questo mondo, il potenziale di miglioramento puÃ² essere molto alto per futuri aggiornamenti, DLC e contenuti aggiuntivi.
CONTRO:
Esplorazione limitata e poche mappe realmente immersive: Personalmente, penso che il gioco sia spesso lineare e non hai la possibilitÃ  di esplorare liberamente l'ambiente circostante per scoprire segreti, dettagli aggiuntivi sulla lore o, piÃ¹ semplicemente, oggetti unici da collezionare. Per quanto riguarda gli scenari, invece, mi aspettavo che alcune mappe fossero piÃ¹ creepy e curate a un contesto Grimdark.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ein grundsolides Spiel.
Es zeichnet sich nicht durch die beste Story oder das beste Gameplay aus.
ABER es zeichnet sich durch eine sehr schÃ¶ne Grafik aus. Vieles ist zwar Kulisse, aber diese ist so schÃ¶n und mit liebe gestaltet das es nicht stÃ¶rt.
Die grÃ¶ÃŸte StÃ¤rke ist aber ganz klar die KÃ¤mpfe im Koop, hier mit deinen Freunden zahllose Feinde nieder zumachen ist ein gutes GefÃ¼hl.

Allerdings ist der Inhalt begrenzt, also wenn euch das wiederholte Spielen der gleichen Maps nicht stÃ¶rt, kÃ¶nnt ihr in diesem Spiel eine gute Zeit haben. Wenn ihr ein etwas langsameres Left4Dead mÃ¶gt. Klare Empfehlung",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

La historia del juego es muy entretenida y si hay muchas referencias a su entrega pasada del 2013, aunque tambiÃ©n tienes que jugar el BOLTGUN para entender lo que pasa despuÃ©s de la primera entrega, sus operaciones extienden un poco mas la campaÃ±a en misiones paralelas que ocurren al mismo tiempo y el multijugador esta bien aun que es un poco mas flojo a comparaciÃ³n de la primera entrega ya que solo puedes ocupar 2 personas cualquiera de las 6 clases que tiene el juego o que disminuyeron la cantidad de jugadores por partida ya que antes era 8 vs 8 pero puede mejorar este apartado en un futuro.

Y recuerda este lema si lo sientes muy pesado el juego y grÃ­talo a todo pulmÃ³n ""Ellos serÃ¡n mis mejores guerreros, serÃ¡n hombres que lo darÃ¡n todo por mÃ­. Como arcilla los modelarÃ© y en los hornos de guerra los forjarÃ©. TendrÃ¡n una determinaciÃ³n de hierro y unos mÃºsculos de acero. Los vestirÃ© con una potente armadura y los armarÃ© con un poderoso armamento. Ni la plaga ni la enfermedad podrÃ¡n tocarlos y ningÃºn mal podrÃ¡ tocarlos. ContarÃ¡n con tales tÃ¡cticas, estrategias y mÃ¡quinas que ningÃºn adversario podrÃ¡ superarlos en batalla. SerÃ¡n los Defensores de la Humanidad. SerÃ¡n los Marines Espaciales ... y no conocerÃ¡n el miedo.""

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but theyâ€™re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own. And while the Operations PvE mode that accompanies it doesnâ€™t currently offer enough to keep me coming back, the deep customization options for your Space Marine do look promising if itâ€™s supported in post-launch updates as planned. Besides, when youâ€™re eviscerating aliens on planets as pretty as these, itâ€™s hard not to leave satisfied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game looks amazing, and there are some impressive set pieces. The swarms look cool as hell. But the combat is just too simplistic and repetitive to play by myself. It's probably more fun if you have a crew to play with, or if you're already a fan of the universe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2024 appears to be the year of excellent sequels. Started with Helldivers 2, ending with Space Marine 2 after a hiatus of 13 years.

This game does a great job of balancing rewarding high skill ceiling while being easy for anyone to pick up with how Combat flows. You also do not need to know anything about Warhammer 40,000 to play this game. There is plenty of call outs for 40K lore junkies to keep them invested while introducing new folks to the lore and setting of the Grim Darkness of the far Feature, where only War exists.

An easy recommend from me if my input is of any worth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tres bon jeu pour s'immerser dans le monde des Ultramarine au niveau de la campagne. Je vous conseil cependant de vous renseigner aussi sur le lore de Warhammer 40K qui est tres riche. Le gameplay est tres bien on a affaire a un 3rd person shooter, avec different type de classes tres interessante. Le jeu en pvp est tres bien balancer avec ses classes differente justement. Le mode operation est excellent et viens se combiner parfaitement avec l'histoire de la campagne.

Jogo maravilhoso, me transporta pros tempos de ouro dos jogos multiplayer, quando multiplayer era algo novo e era simplesmente diversao por diversao.
gameplay satisfatÃ³ria, interessante, empresa se comunica com a player base, nao tem nenhum FOMO(fear of missing out, da um google ai), progressao dos bonecos e classes muito interessante, enfim, so tenho elogios a tecer.
o ultimo update que introduziu a dificuldade letal esta otimo e nao vejo muito sentido nas reclamacoes, Ã© um modo bem dificil pra quem quer jogar num modo bem dificil, tem todas as outras dificuldades pro caso vc queira algo mais tranquilo, mas que ainda te recompense e te de uma progressao satisfatoria.
pvp INCRIVEL, mais uma vez, me transporta pra epoca de ouro do inicio dos jogos multiplayer.

By the emperor, this is a good ol game but be warned. the machine spirit embeded In this game is quite paticulair.

My cogitator is of quite high standards with an 4080 super and a Ryzen 7 9700, but still the machine spirit seaces to co-operate and crashes out doing the most mundane tasks like loading up a save file. not even the fixes given by other tech-priests seem to calm the machine spirit down.

with great sadness this game is unplayable for me now. still I'd recomend for who's game does work it is a might pice of art..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disappointed and Embarrassed by the Update..

It's not even the ridiculous nerfs.. You showed us so much and gave us so little.. we were all expecting new armour and weapons and you gave us nothing. No reason to continue to play? What is the point of playing PVE and PVP without leaderboards, armour-tiers, titles? Accolades? anything?! Instead, we got what was gradually being called a repetitive game become MORE repetitive.. It almost feels like you messed up on purpose. Why purposely destroy it's future like Helldivers? I defended this game time and time again. Please pull back the update and return with amour and weapons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Familiar formula, familiar weakening, what's wrong with you Europeans and Americans? You live too comfortably, right? I don't recommend anyone to buy Space Marine 2.

Beauty Without Depth: A Stunning Journey That Falls Short

Within its first hour, Space Marine 2 hits all the right notes and gets you pumped about the journey ahead. The first thing you notice is how magnificent the game looks and soundsâ€”not just on a technical level, but also in terms of art design. Iâ€™m glad that this aspect remains consistent until the end. However, in terms of gameplay, things are sadly not looking so good. At first, the combat feels crunchy and fast, almost like a third-person Doom, but as time goes on, the downsides become more pronounced than the positives. After only a couple of hours, you realize how restrictive the level and mission design is. Additionally, the encounters start to feel superficial due to the lackluster weapon design. Almost every encounter can be easily completed with any of the weapons, which lack identity; as a result, you, as the player, donâ€™t feel in control of the combatâ€”you just go with the flow, shooting mindlessly with a couple of melee combos and finishers here and there.

The story is mindbogglingly simple, but the performances are strong, so the game doesnâ€™t feel entirely lifeless in that regard. Itâ€™s also surprisingly a direct sequel, both in terms of story and spirit. Iâ€™m pleased that a change in development studio didnâ€™t result in a soft reboot.

All in all, Space Marine 2 is a marvelous technical and artistic achievement; however, it fails to deliver as a compelling video game. I have only played the single-player campaign, so everything I say is directed at that aspect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although I really enjoy this game, I unfortunately can't recommend it at the moment due to a persisting bug locking up the game when alt+tabbing. Aside from that, it runs very well for me, but this bug has presented multiple times and is pretty frustrating to deal with.

Once this bug's resolved, I'll change this to a full review with a thumbs up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I won't deny that Space Marine 2 has some awesome moments (namely, any time you perform an Execution) but it's developers make a lot of decisions that chip away at my patience or otherwise confound me. I'll put a full list below, but some of the major ones are just a lack of cross-class weapon availability, extremely stingy use of I-Frames in a game with a lot of animation locks, and gating progression behind forced difficulty increases.

I also don't like Classes, but that's entirely my preference and I understand that's just how Monetization has decided Modern Gaming is going to develop.

1. Every class should be able to use every sidearm. Canonically, these are all Ultramarines, so you can't use the excuse 'well, different chapters learn different skills!' they are all in the same Chapter, and while I can generally forgive things like Heavies not getting Melee Weapons or Snipers locked to Knives, this is one thing I take major issue with.
2. No Automatic Sidearm at Launch? My trigger finger is getting enough exercise to lift a Bolter Pistol, and I am not a fan. Please add a sidearm that I can hold down the trigger and spray into Tyranid hordes properly.
3. Experience and Currency rewards are absolutely pitiful on Minimal and Moderate. I often won't even be able to afford a Color Pack after a mission on those difficulties, nevermind weapons. I can forgive putting my nose to the grindstone for class experience, but considering that progression is tied to unlocking and mastering weapons (which requires currency to buy every version of a weapon) this isn't okay.
4. Far more egregious is that Artifact and Relic Artifact Data is locked behind Substantial and Ruthless Difficulties respectively. Do you want to progress past Tier 2 Weapons? Well, your options are A) Tryhard, or B) Uninstall.
5. Speaking of Armory Data, it's not guaranteed for completing the mission. One has to be found in the mission (it is guaranteed to spawn, but ) and the other is from bosses that potentially spawn in the mission (but are not guaranteed, and also might coincide with the Horde Timer.)
6. Certain areas are basically guaranteed to Horde, which works heavily against it. Decapitation's Chapel is the best case of this: You can fight a Horde right outside the transition door, kill every Tyranid, enter, miss and then have to fight It's an extremely confined area which makes it even worse.
7. I-Frames are only built into Executions, like five frames of a successful Parry, and half of your Dodge. Most animations otherwise don't even have Hyperarmor, meaning you can get knocked out of your Stim, or you can start a Gunstrike instead of Parry and then get stunlocked and destroyed.
8. Ai cannot be assigned classes in Private Lobbies, nor can they be assigned specific weapons.
9. It's freaking 2024 and Helldivers 2, allows full remapping of all buttons on both Keyboard and Controller, what excuse does Focus have that I can't manually map my Melee to B/Circle button?

Focus recently released PAtch 4.0, and after an extreme amount of backlash, released 4.1 which removed nearly everything we hated from 4.0 (which was basically the whole thing, minus the introduction of Lethal) so the Developers CAN change the game if we demand it enough, and very quickly too. I'll flip my thumb when they rework Armory Data though, because it's still â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I have to play on Ruthless to upgrade my weapons to max.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Game is awesome and I love it, but the game stopped working on Linux systems, including the Steam Deck.

Linux users are getting AVF error, and it makes the game unplayable, I can't even load into the campaign.

Game is getting a negative review despite it being one of the best games of 2024, because 60$ game is unâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ingplayable and they also straight up LIED in the most recent HOTFIX that they fixed Linux and Steam Deck. No, they did not, they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?lied. you can't even refund it, because it's been over a month and I have over 20 hours in the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game is awesome.
Great story, nice campaign and very cool CO-OP. The PVP is kinda ""ok"", but could be better.
The major issue they need to fix is the constant disconnects during CO-OP missions. You can grind for 1 hour doing a mission, still there's a 50% chance of being disconnected out of nothing. Then, you get zero XP, zero progress, zero rewards. It's pure time wasted and back to the lobby. The worst part that IT MAY EVEN HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE THE HOST, AND YOU ARE PLAYING ALONE. Crazy, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BUY THIS GAME.

People normally tell me, ""You really do live in nostalgia"". But after getting a bunch of my friends to buy this game and talk about it being a relief not to have to race through a battle pass and all the extra BS we are shoved in our face. it's a full game and dlc just adds icing onto this wonderfully made cake, nothing more. It truly feels like back in the golden age between 2001-2010.

Truly the Devs of this game cooked. Thank you Devs and by the Emperor, we will purge Xenos in GLORY",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent patch was supposed to add ultrawide support and now it's broken entirely, if you have a 32:9 monitor your view will be incredibly zoomed in and unpleasant, the devs haven't mentioned anything yet about a fix and for that reason I'm leaving this review to warn off people who have an ultrawide monitor.

UPDATE: The patch hasn't fixed the issue on 32:9 and as of now the game is still not in a playable state without me installing a mod to fix the problem, will update my review accordingly as things change",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jesus, can't believe they are doing same as Arrowhead with Helldivers 2.
Using quick and effortless nerfing to make ballance changes, which nobody wants and destroing the game.
Unbelievable, that after Saber saw what happend to Helldivers, and how hard was for devs to get back, doing same mistake..
And the ""Proximity to squad"" feature in Lethal difficulity - my god, are you kidding me ? so we are not able to play classes how they intend to be played right? Or you want the sniper to be tight with squad? are you crazy? Vanguard cant use tha grappel hook, because immediately break the proximity and noone get armor back...
NO more COMMENT - worst patch ive ever seen..

Mis andanzas con la franquicia Warhammer datan de cuando aÃºn era un preadolescente, y era un reverendo fanÃ¡tico del mundo de Fantasy. Recuerdo con cariÃ±o la primera vez que tuve internet en casa, en aquel PC de pantalla gorda color crema, y una de mis primeras bÃºsquedas fue con el propÃ³sito de ver miniaturas nuevas de los Condes Vampiro.
Nunca entendÃ­ por quÃ© 40K desbancÃ³ a Fantasy de forma tan brutal, y aunque acabÃ© enamorado de esta nueva IP, a dÃ­a de hoy Fantasy guarda un lugar especial en mi corazÃ³n.

ConocÃ­ Warhammer 40k mÃ¡s tarde que pronto, y no fue hasta el genial Rogue Trader que entendÃ­ de verdad su mundo. Cuando saliÃ³ el Space Marine original, hace ya 10 aÃ±os, aÃºn no sabÃ­a la delirante profundidad y oscuridad de este universo.

Hoy, con mÃ¡s conocimiento sobre el lore que nunca, Space Marine 2 parece un doble regalo bajado del cielo; una carta de amor incondicional no solo para los viejos amantes de los muÃ±equitos y las batallas en mesa, sino tambiÃ©n de los que echamos de menos el tipo de videojuegos que se hacÃ­an en aquella Ã©poca en la que lo importante era llegar a tu pÃºblico objetivo y no llenarse los bolsillos con monetizaciones absurdas, cosmÃ©ticos, refritos, crossovers putrefactos, todo el despliegue racial e invent-sexual de la gran ciudad americana promedio y demÃ¡s basura postmodernista.

Space Marine nos ofrece una campaÃ±a que hace 15 aÃ±os se considerarÃ­a otra mÃ¡s del montÃ³n de experiencias jugables de gran calidad, pero que hoy desgraciadamente es un soplo de aire fresco en una industria que cada vez mÃ¡s se canibaliza a si misma y constantemente muerde la mano que pone la comida en su mesa.
Adicionalmente nos ofrece 6 misiones extra de un grupo de marines paralelo en la que puedes customizar tu propio Astartes personal con los colores del capÃ­tulo, armas y armadura que desees, a la vez que ofrece infinita rejugabilidad subiendo cada una de las muy diferentes clases.

Por Ãºltimo y tambiÃ©n importante, Space Marine 2 nos ofrece una experienca jugador contra jugador por el momento algo limitada, con un par de mapas y un par de modos, en la que un bando de Marines se enfrenta a otro de Marines del Caos por la supremacÃ­a galÃ¡ctica. Aunque con visos a ser expandido en el futuro, este modo ofrece una muy satisfactoria jugabilidad bebiendo del shooter multijugador tradicional arcade tipo Call of Duty (baja al borde de la muerte, puntos, remontada, subida de experiencia de armas etc.) pero sin tener que ver a Niky Minaj ni a Messi embutidos en una servoarmadura.

Para poner la guinda a tan jugoso pastel, el mismÃ­simo CEO de la compaÃ±Ã­a dejÃ³ un comentario en un vÃ­deo de Asmongold apuntando su hartazgo de la desesperaciÃ³n de las corporaciones por introducir polÃ­ticas moralistas en sus productos y abogÃ³ por un futuro en el que los videojuegos vuelvan a ser como antaÃ±o, diseÃ±ados para disfrutar y apelar a su audiencia y no para sermonearla.

Space Marine 2 se siente como un juego de hace 10 aÃ±os- una afirmaciÃ³n que hace diez aÃ±os tendrÃ­a un matiz negativo pero que hoy, en pleno 2024, desgraciadamente es mÃºsica para los oÃ­dos de todos aquellos que disfrutamos del medio tal y como se concibiÃ³.

Muy recomendado.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oui !

Les points positifs :
+ Graphismes de trÃ¨s bonne qualitÃ©
+ Gameplay dynamique et agressif, offrant une vraie sensation de puissance, avec une bonne dose de gore
+ Excellente bande son

Les points nÃ©gatifs :
- Peu de missions disponibles
- Certaines missions sont trop longues Ã  mon goÃ»t : elles peuvent durer plus de 45 minutes Ã  1 heure. Jâ€™aurais prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© quâ€™elles soient divisÃ©es en deux missions plus courtes, car ce nâ€™est pas pratique lorsque l'on nâ€™a pas autant de temps devant soi.
- Bestiaire et arsenal un peu limitÃ©s
- Trop d'interactions inutiles, comme celles Ã  faire juste pour monter dans un ascenseur
- Les tirs des ennemis passent Ã  travers certains objets
- La difficultÃ© pourrait Ãªtre mieux Ã©quilibrÃ©e : au lieu d'augmenter simplement les HP des ennemis, les transformant en vÃ©ritables Ã©ponges Ã  balles, il aurait Ã©tÃ© plus judicieux d'accroÃ®tre leur nombre et leur variÃ©tÃ©. (c'est trÃ¨s mal pensÃ© quand on fait face Ã  plusieurs ennemis puissants, espacÃ©s, qui te tirent dessus Ã  distance)

Conclusion : Le jeu est globalement excellent et trÃ¨s divertissant, mÃªme si le contenu est un peu lÃ©ger pour pleinement justifier son statut de jeu AAA Ã  70 euros.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wide as a puddle, deep as the same puddle, with more padding than a Primaris Power Armor, and yet only amounting to an 8-10 hour campaign with maybe 4 hours of actual gameplay.

Please don't buy this at full price.

This would be quite a neat, if dragging, experience for 15 bucks. Asking for 60, or even 90 or 100 bucks for this is, frankly, insulting and shows how desperate people are for good a 40k experience. Sadly, this one ain't it.

For what's actually in the campaign:

You're jumping in the role of a grumpy, whinging, military door technician role playing as one of the Emperor's Chosen. During your fights with all of 8 types of enemies the game has on offer, next to its 3 bosses, your main job is pressing door opening buttons waiting for elevators.

Combat difficulty mostly revolves around avoiding getting pelted by ranged combat damage while trying to get into melee range, where the spectacular takedown animations and the mini-cutscene camera work really shines. Melee combat is covered by invulnerability and regeneration granted by these extended animations, i-frames during dodges, and a parry window wider than the greatest stained-glass displays in the Cathedrals of Terra.

Between combat encounters, you're walking down narrow, samey corridors with a ton of buttons and objective markers. There is always one way forward and one little side area, sometimes two, that contain an extra med pack, ammo pack and combat boosts. But don't fear, there will be an objective marker at the ready telling you the way forward, and which button to press for the next line of stiff dialog.

The campaign is a formulaic low engagement spectacle, dragging from vista to vista, where the characters in the cutscenes get to have a lot more fun and do way cooler things than what you're allowed to do in game.

Your â€œalways ready for coopâ€?group of 3 Marines, with our main character Primaries Marine, the flanked the jealous upstart that we'll grow to love over the course of the move and the placeholder personality and is also around for other to say lines at.

These are not the transhuman weapons of destruction, sworn to the will of the Emperor, and imbued with their 22 or 19 gene-seed organs respectively. This is Sergeant Jake McMuricaMan and his squabbling Band of Brothers, more devoted to human infighting about rank and questing orders than to carry forward the will of the Emperor in their Call of Duty. The plot might as well stem from one of these shooters.

The combat loop, when the game actually hands over controls to you, is split up 2 to 4 minute encounters in a contained arena. Each fight is followed up by 3â€?0 minutes of walking around, watching cutscenes, holding â€œforwardâ€?while more drooling placeholder dialog dribbles as you press some elevator button, and then finally arriving at the next small combat scene. But not before you're promoted to press the ATTENTION button to make sure you're not missing the highly scripted vista waiting for you. This Disneyland approach to level design can work out great for spectacle fighters, or depending on the difficulty you pick, walking simulators, but falls flat here as there is no overarching narrative or story being progressed. Just another power generator that needs turning on, another door that needs opening, another obstacle to walk around. All while the most impactful and coolest moments of the story happen off-screen.

The fact that the avoided having chest high walls and a cover bottom is the only concession made to modern game design on display. This small grace helped it feel at least a bit like 40k and not like the Gears of War cover shooter it felt like most of the time. You still get your fill of invisible walls blocking your every movement while the game is busy acting out its budget Hollywood movie that you get in the way with your desire to play it. Most of the areas could as well be wrapped up in yellow and black â€œSTORYLINE â€?DO NOT CROSSâ€?tape.

Now take your Medal of Honor and leave, Doorfighter of Ultramar.

---

Oh wait, we also shipped with Multiplayer! As all game executives of the 00'ths have taught us: Every shooter needs a multiplayer!

Multiplayer during the campaign seamlessly replaces one of your AI companions with a player. A neat system that, apart from some net code issues leading to desync and teleporting, works most of the time. Post campaign PvE content then is replaying 6 pieces sliced from campaign maps over and over again to gain XP to level up each of the 6 classes. All in all, a very simplified version of coop games like Warhammer 40k: Darktide, Deep Rock Galactic or Helldivers. While it feels thrown in to justify the horrendously overpriced experience, it does allow for a more combat focused experience with fewer story exposition and waiting segments, which is welcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is your Duty?
To serve the Emperor's Will.
What is the Emperor's Will?
That we fight and die.
What is Death?
It is our Duty.

Where there is uncertainty, I shall bring light.
Where there is doubt, I shall sow faith.
Where there is shame, I shall point atonement.
Where there is rage, I shall show its course.
My word in the soul shall be as my bolter in the field.

Without the Dark, there can be no Light,
We have purpose
Without the Lie, there can be no Truth,
We have purpose
Without the War, there can be no Victory,
We have purpose
Without the Death, there can be no sacrifice,
We have purpose
Without the Hope there can be no Future,
We have purpose
Without the Loyalty there can be no one chapter,
We have purpose
Without the Emperor, there is nothing,...
And we would have no purpose",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

En el lejano y oscuro futuro del aÃ±o 40.000, solo hay guerra. Vivir en estos tiempos es vivir en el rÃ©gimen mÃ¡s cruel y sangriento imaginable. Olvidad el poder de la tecnologÃ­a, de la ciencia y de la humanidad. La vida se ha convertido en una lucha desesperada por la supervivencia. La vigilancia y la devociÃ³n por el Emperador son el Ãºnico refugio contra los enemigos del Hombre.

El PvE estÃ¡ bien, pero el PvP es, francamente, un desastre. El sistema de emparejamiento es tan malo que te mete en partidas prÃ¡cticamente perdidas, lo que arruina cualquier posibilidad de disfrutar. Â¿Y lo peor? Te obliga a quedarte con los mismos jugadores en lugar de buscar una nueva partida. Es ridÃ­culo. Todo es un caos, no puedes hacer nada, y para colmo, no hay ni un botÃ³n de reporte. Me encontrÃ© con un jugador que me mataba de un solo golpe, y el sistema me metiÃ³ en la misma sala con Ã©l Â¡dos veces seguidas! Inaceptable.

La historia merece un 9/10, pero el PvP se lleva un miserable 6/10. Necesita una mejora urgente, y ya ni hablemos del lobby, que es tan bÃ¡sico que duele. El PvP tiene potencial, pero ahora mismo estÃ¡ muy lejos de ser bueno. 100% recomendado.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Writing this as I've finished all the achievements in the game.

Campaign is short but sweet, operations mode needs more maps, though it does offer endless replay-ability. PVP is fun, though some classes are better than others and there's just 3 maps to rotate out of, but overall,the game at launch is solid, with more promising content to come like horde mode, maps in both operations mode, and PVP, and hopefully more classes.

Terminids are hella fun to fight against however Chaos need a bit of rework; â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the ranged weapons of Chaos Marines and the shielded Zhangors are tanky AF.

If you played this game and don't enjoy it, you're either playing on easy mode or you haven't mastered the flow of combat yet.

Other than the occasional network issues and crashes, this game is solid, and well worth the price I paid at launch. 10/10 would parry and gun strike for the Emperor again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the campaign is making the pricetag look reasonable, even with the glitches/connection issues, this was still one of the coolest experiences i've had playing with two friends, pve is replayable, maps will get stale, but the gameplay is solid enough that i want to comeback and play a few runs

the game will be updated to include more content, seeing as devs gave us a roadmap

could be goty ?

and yeah, it's a different experience to play alone, and not in the good way, get two friends to buy the game along with you, preferably try to get a walking 40k lore library, makes the walkthrough that much better if someone can explain most of the things that you'll be experiencing throughout the campaign (if you know nothing about the universe, ofc)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

40K Space marine 2.

So long have i waited for it's arrival and it was everything i wanted and so much much more. Waiting on a day to day, week to week and even HOUR TO HOUR basis for the game to come out after first preordering the game by saving up some allowance, the campaign felt cathartic and divine.
Nothing short of phenomenal for me who has been engrossed in this universe for the last 14-15 years of my damn life.

Every tidbit of detail, voice acting, set pieces and generally the entire game itself is crafted with love and care from people who understand the setting to it's core and do not care about anything else.

I wish young me could see this game and go ""â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?that's the future...""

Codex Approved
Campaign: Well paced plot is easy to digest and has a solid ending. Final boss fight is awesome with lots cool moment throughout.
Operations PVE: Lots to grind for and feels fairly challenging for progression; was hoping their be more than 6 ops, but they have promised more for free with each season.
Eternal War PVP: This mode unfortunately feel like it got done last minute. The game modes there are fine, but there's only 3 maps with spawns being terribly setup and classes definitely having balancing issues. More maps and mode have been promised, but balancing will come with time.
Customisation: There is tons to unlock for each class with plenty of colours and emblems to make whatever marine you can think of. That's at least for the loyalist astrates. The traitor astrates however suffer from same thing as pvp part of the game, probably cause they were done last minute as well. The armour is locked to a set class with only colours and emblem being changeable.

Overall an upgrade to everything in the previous game beside the pvp aspect at the moment. With plenty more content coming down the pipeline I'm sure it can only improve.
I give 9/10 nurglings.

As of November 2024, game still doing awesome and new content is great!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's time to write a review. The main problems of this game:
1) Connection - constant connection errors in the ""eternal war"" mode, in particular problem 140, when you have to re-enter the game several times before all the stars align in the sky and you are allowed into the match, instead of being offered to go to the main menu once again . After which, by the way, nothing will change, you will still have to restart the game, and so on several times.
2) Chaos marine customization. We have a fairly rich customization for Loyalists and such a poor one for Chaos marine. Why are Chaos marine each class tied to a specific legion??? Why are there so few armor parts for them??? There are no my favorite ""thousand sons"" (Although they were in the main campaign of the game. Is it so difficult to integrate ready-made skins into pvp mode???). In general, Chaos marines are represented by a small number of legions, but where are the individual warbands, which are so numerous in the Warhammer 40k universe??? Here's another thing: Have you ever seen Berserker Khorne without a chain axe??? - and here you will see.
3) Class system. I will not say that some classes are completely unplayable, or become more or less playable only after opening some items. I have a completely different question here: Why does a game like ""Total Tournament"" or ""Quake Arena"" have a class system at all??? And the classes themselves do not inspire confidence: if the ""Night Lords"" still look in place, then Khorne berserkers in the form of a non-assault class are nonsense. Let me remind you that Saber ""presses so much on lore in its communications with the community"", for example, they have already answered the question: ""why is each legion of chaos tied to a specific class?"" - because it is according to the lore, and right then we see the berserker Khorne, who is clearly out of place. If you follow the class system, you will simply have to enter 100,500 thousand classes for each type of space marines, and then you will have to make 100,500 patches to balance this whole thing. I think it's easier to introduce a system of factions (legions), for example, you choose a legion to which specific types of space marines are available, and that's it. By the way, does anyone know why class experience in pvp mode??? (so I have classes that are developed to level 5, but how do they differ from the same class of level 1???)
4) I think it is no longer a secret for anyone that in the future it is a game service. Please remind me of the fate of most such ""new generation"" games))) I understand that all developers want to put their games on the ""monetization rails"" as soon as possible. I think at the stage of loot boxes with a small chance of dropping rare items, it will be possible to put the game on the ""Steam shelf"" and never come back here. I pre-ordered the max edition because I believed in this game, but if at some point I'm offered to buy skins and loot boxes in a AAA-game that's actually being sold instead of being offered for free, that would be a ""slap in the face"".

P.S I am giving a negative rating just to draw attention to the problems. The game is actually pretty good and has a lot of potential.",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a simple man, vine para matar bichos y FUAA, es increÃ­ble cÃ³mo se disfruta en todo momento. Es muuuy divertido y frenÃ©tico, y misiÃ³n tras misiÃ³n la epicidad asciende hasta llegar al peak que son las Ãºltimas horas. Una joya.

AÃºn me quedan los modos PVE y PVP (no le tengo ganas a este Ãºltimo, mÃ¡s por curiosidad), pero terminÃ© completamente satisfecho con esa campaÃ±a.

UPDATE: Tras mÃ¡s de 50 hs, me metÃ­ de lleno en los modos Operaciones y Guerra Eterna. El PVE es una delicia, son siete misiones (a la fecha) que tienen muchÃ­sima rejugabilidad y a mi me divirtieron bastante en las dificultades mÃ¡s altas, y mÃ¡s aÃºn si uno varÃ­a entre las clases para probar distintos estilos de juego. El PVP por otro lado estÃ¡ ok para jugar un par de partidas y ya, me quitaba las ganas el hecho de que tarda bastante en encontrar partidas y, cuando lo hace, casi siempre me manda a servidores de USA dÃ¡ndome alta latencia xd

As a 10 year veteran of the prequel. Space Marine 2 delivers on multiple areas. I greatly enjoyed the redemption arc this time around for Captain Titus. I never thought I would find out what happened to him after Graia. As of now weâ€™re little light on content and few minor issues, but the potential this game has can be endless. Looking forward to see what the Devs bring in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gioco indubbiamente divertente e dalla lore importante, ma per la cifra che chiedono il gioco ha problemi di crash specie in multiplayer, le operation che non sono altro che delle missioni alla vermintide, pensavo almeno fossero dungeon generati proceduralmente invece per crescere di livello bisogna ripetere le stesse missioni in continuazione, non si possono startare tramite lobby privata scegliendo magari di andare con i bot ma bisogna per forza aspettare che qualcuno si unisca in gruppo sono stato anche 20min prima di startare una missione, dulcis in fundus non e' detto che riusciate a pinnare la vostra classe perche' ad ogni inizio operation bisogna selezionarla da zero, ora ditemi voi se e' sensato nel 2024 sta roba, per startare una partita si devono attendere gli allineamenti astrali corretti. Cari sviluppatori volete fino a 90 bombe per il gioco allora dovete iniziare a rilascare giochi che abbiano gia' un senso all'uscita al momento di giocabile c'e' solo la campagna base che dura 10 ore. Consiglio vivamente di tenere l'hype ormai i giochi escono ma in realta' sono pronti dopo almeno 1 anno e io mi sono veramente rotto da fare da beta tester a pagamento.

Piccolo aggiornamento sulla progression:
che dire oltre al fatto che il match making non tiene conto della classe scelta dall'inizio ma bisogna ripinnare la classe ogni nuovo start di missione, volevo parlare di exp presa in gioco, exp lockata da step e token, e' impossibile allo stato attuale preparare il pg alle operation di livello superiore in quanto i materiali e denaro necessari a sbloccare le armi rare e poi leggenderie si prendono solo ed esclusivamente se si portano a termine le op. a livello elevato, calcolando i vari crash in gioco, calcolando che ci sono party dove buttano fuori l'indesiderato poco prima di finire la missione, calcolando la difficolta' dei nemici, al momento la progression e' totalmente da riguardare. Per quanto mi riguarda i token sono da togliere e le armi e armature si dovrebbero sbloccare semplicemente livellando il pg.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excelente continuaciÃ³n e imperdible titulo!

Su rendimiento es muy bueno y su calidad grÃ¡fica tambiÃ©n, se nota que los devs mantuvieron al detalle lo que es W40K.

A nivel de historia, es entretenida, difÃ­cil y desafiante, con grandes momentos de acciÃ³n, intriga y exploraciÃ³n, muy corto para algunos, pero cine para muchos!

Sin mas que decir que es un titulo ultra recomendado.

DÃ©Ã§u! Grand fan de warhammer 40k, autant l'idÃ©e est top, les chapitres, les customs d'armes, les graphismes et les animations gÃ©niales.

Mais le reste... l'obligation de refaire la campagne alors qu'on l'a dÃ©jÃ  faite en coop avec des collÃ¨gues, je ne vois pas le principe. Pas d'historique des checkpoints des diffÃ©rentes parties (campagne) qu'on a pu faire.

Les bots Space Marine sont inutile Ã  part revive avec 2000pts d'HP #GadrielPower. La campagne est linÃ©aire bien dommage quand on voit ce que font d'autres studios Helldiver, Fallout... L'univers le permet, on dirait la recette de Space Marine 1 dont on a juste rÃ©visÃ© la copie.

Sans compter le multi avec un matchmaking ""explosÃ©"". Qui vous mets 3 niveaux 20 en face de 3 niveaux 9... Parce que oui c'Ã©tait pas assez simple de faire en sorte que le rank s'applique Ã  notre unitÃ© entiÃ¨re? Et que l'expÃ©rience du jeu ou plutÃ´t l'histoire soit plus intÃ©ressante.

> L'assaut : 3 coups de marteau Ã©nergÃ©tique pour tuer un scout...
> Le scout au sniper : 3 balles pour tuer un bonhomme...
> Le devastator : increvable
> Le tactique est bien Ã©quilibrÃ© Ã©tonnement

Et pour finir l'UI du jeu... Autant le design est top mais vous faites un jeu en coop sans faire de menu social in-game propre, on galÃ¨re pour inviter des amis Ã  jouer c'est risible. Appelez-moi pour faire une vraie UX c'est mon taff.

Franchement l'univers W40K a tellement plus de potentiel, vous utilisez Ã  peine 10% et encore dans une logique de jeu d'il y a 10 ans (PVP, match, campagne). C'est triste Ã  mon goÃ»t, pourquoi ne pas reprendre la recette de Helldiver en allant plus loin avec les races de W40k, envahissement, campagne planÃ©taires voir galactiques etc... avec un choix de ""races"" de W40k qu'on pourrait incarner en fonction des souhaits de chacun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jako aspirujÄ…cy fan WH40k jestem bardzo zadowolony z tej gry.
Plusy:
+ Kampania, krÃ³tka ale treÅ›ciwa i bardzo wciÄ…gajÄ…ca. Ciekawie napisane postacie oraz wiele momentÃ³w, w ktÃ³re zapieraÅ‚y dech w piersiach.
+ Gunplay na bardzo duÅ¼y plus. Czujemy kaÅ¼dy strzaÅ‚ jaki oddajemy, czujemy kaÅ¼de trafienie we wroga. Walka broniÄ… biaÅ‚Ä… jest rÃ³wnieÅ¼ bardzo satysfakcjonujÄ…ca. Finishery to bajeczka i nigdy siÄ™ nie nudzÄ….
+ Oprawa audio-wizualna jest niesamowita. IloÅ›Ä‡ szczegÃ³Å‚Ã³w na pancerzach, budynkach jest ogromna. RÃ³wnieÅ¼ wyostrzenie tego wszystkiego jest dopracowane do perfekcji.
+ Optymalizacja, grajÄ…c na RTX 3070 i i9 12 gen, w Å¼aden sposÃ³b nie doÅ›wiadczyÅ‚em spadkÃ³w FPSÃ³w. Dla mnie plus, ale nie wiem jak jest na sprzÄ™tach innych graczy.
+ RÃ³Å¼norodnoÅ›Ä‡ broni. ArsenaÅ‚ naprawdÄ™ jest pokaÅºny i moÅ¼na sobie dopasowaÄ‡ klasÄ™ jaka nas interesuje oraz broÅ„. Znajdzie siÄ™ tu coÅ› dla kaÅ¼dego.
Minusy:
- MaÅ‚o tych operacji PVE. Wiem, Å¼e sÄ… one bezpoÅ›rednio poÅ‚Ä…czone z fabuÅ‚Ä…, ale no niestety, jest ich za maÅ‚o.
- Gierka raczej jest do pogrania przez 1h, max 2h i potem trzeba zrobiÄ‡ przerwÄ™, poniewaÅ¼ jej powtarzalnoÅ›Ä‡ jest bardzo wysoka. Nawet zmiana klasy na innÄ… za bardzo nie pomaga. Natomiast w moim przypadku wystÄ™puje duÅ¼a chÄ™Ä‡ powrotu do grania po upÅ‚ywie tych 2h.
- Brak rozrÃ³Å¼nienia historii zakonu, Å¼e tak to nazwijmy. Kumpel mi na to zwrÃ³ciÅ‚ uwagÄ™ i faktycznie zaczÄ™Å‚o to trochÄ™ przeszkadzaÄ‡. KolorujÄ…c Czarnego Templariusza albo Kosmicznego Wilka dostajemy nadal kwestie dialogowe Ultramarynarzy. Niestety jest to minus zwiÄ…zany z tym, Å¼e operacje podchodzÄ… pod fabuÅ‚Ä™. Mam nadziejÄ™, Å¼e w przyszÅ‚ych sezonach siÄ™ to zmieni.

I to tyle z mojej strony.
Mocne 8/10 jak dla mnie!

PS. WaliÄ‡ te negatywne recenzje, ktÃ³re szkalujÄ… gierkÄ™ tylko dlatego, Å¼e wgrywa nam jakiÅ› program do crossplayu od Epica. Ci ludzie nawet nie sÄ… Å›wiadomi ile razy inne gry im to instalowaÅ‚y xD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 is an instant classic. It harkens back to the days when games were simple but fun. The campaign, while short, is a breath of fresh air when it comes to story-lines. The voice acting is perfect. It has one of the best representations of the WH40K world and most importantly, the Space Marines and the Imperium of Man. The storyline is simple but executed perfectly. The characters are simple as well, stoic, stalwart Marines who will risk death for their fellow brothers and their mission, and that's ok.

The devs and Saber should be proud of SM2. It's a return to classic gaming and what makes gaming fun. There's no hidden agendas, narratives or overt political messages shoved down our throats. There's no overly complicated characters with a plethora of problems pouring their hearts out and whining incessantly about how the world is against them. It's a simple storyline about brotherhood, duty, loyalty and just your basic good vs. evil. So refreshing.

Buy it. It's worth it. The campaign is gloriously fun and gets your blood pumping with the amazing cinematics. The multiplayer is addictive and isn't overly grindy. You truly feel more powerful as you level up. I look forward to new missions, enemies and PvP modes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs, I am not here to praise or criticize this game. I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!

Here are the ingredients you will need!

Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.

Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.

Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.


1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.

2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.

4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.

5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.

6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.

7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.

8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.

9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.

10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You might find excuses to avoid engaging with this game, perhaps pointing to its flaws.

But such excuses are nothing but weakness, and weakness is the seed of heresy.

To turn your back on this game, my brothers, is to forsake the Emperorâ€™s light. Doubt is a mark of treachery, and treachery demands immediate justice.

Remember this: our vigilance is unrelenting. Fail in your duty, and you will face the wrath of the Emperorâ€™s might.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pros:
Campaign is excellent. If you played the first you'll love it. Co-Op is fun if you rotate classes and switch it up.
Cons:
Has connection issues, logging out of game and into game always works to resolve. Co-Op can feel a bit grindy due to limited missions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My experience for me the battlefields of Avarax and analysis of the Battle reports collude to me that the fight against the Xenos scum is glorys and great fun Brother.

Pros:
The Game looks Butyfull same whit the gore.
The Story is around 10h long if you not try to run trought it .
The Wargear is quite large and all weapons feel unique.
Coop and Pvp are great wille still having a few server problem.

Con:
You get stuck in Loading screens often.
(Will probely be fixed soon)

Conclusion:
If you are loyal to the god Emporer you should join the fight against the Xenos scum and claim the Honor of the Abomunations you will slauhter.
You will not regret it 9,5/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imagina que Gears Of War y World War Z hubieran tenido un hijo, un hijo al que le han inyectado esteroides en vena y lo han dotado de caracterÃ­sticas como un combate brutal y visceral o un gunplay de los mejores que hemos tenido en lo que va de aÃ±o.

Pues creo que esta es una de las descripciones que mÃ¡s se acerca a lo que es el concepto de Space Marine 2.

Un juego bastante redondo, con una buena campaÃ±a que se puede jugar en cooperativo (lo cual es un plus) aunque es verdad que la historia a partir de la mitad flojea un poco, no quiero entrar en spoilers pero el cambio de facciÃ³n enemiga a mitad de juego parece que estÃ¡ un poco metido con calzador.

Un modo operaciones que estÃ¡ bastante bien y te anima bastante a jugarlo por que:

Primero: son misiones complementarias a las de la campaÃ±a, en los mismos entornos pero con otros lugares, soldados y objetivos. Como si de misiones secundarias se tratara pero orientadas al juego en equipo.

Segundo: tiene un sistema de clases y de progresiÃ³n bastante adictivo, donde insta a jugar para desbloquear mejoras de personaje, mejoras de arma y aspectos de ambos, ya que se consiguen puntos para hacer progreso en las herÃ¡ldicas o comprar nuevas habilidades de las clases con subidas de nivel.

Tercero: Son rejugables en cierta medida gracias a que tienen un poco de aleatoriedad como pasa en Warhammer 40.000 Darktide, con spawns random de oleadas, minibosses y cambios de objetos, RNG de items etc.

En cuanto al multijugador yo lo he encontrado bastante decepcionante por diversas razones.

La primera de todas es que son Arenas, que te da la sensaciÃ³n de jugar una mezcla rara entre un ""Gears"" multiplayer y un hero shooter por el tema de las habilidades de las clases.

Los mapas son pequeÃ±os, algo laberÃ­nticos y cerrados, a mÃ­ en lo personal me recuerdan mucho mÃ¡s a estar jugando a Quake/DooM arena que a otra cosa y la verdad es que es una formula que no me termina de convencer en un juego donde se juega en 3a persona y en el que los personajes creo que no son los idÃ³neos para este tipo de mapas, creo que hubiera sido un acierto mucho mÃ¡s grande el hacerlo un multijugador mÃ¡s ""tradicional"" o con un concepto algo mÃ¡s a lo titanfall, con PvPvE que tenga marines como jugadores y soldados normales controlados por IA, al menos yo creo que hubiera sido una experiencia mucho mÃ¡s disfrutable.

Al menos me da la sensaciÃ³n de que el juego no tiene SBMM y es algo de agradecer, el ping es bastante parejo asÃ­ que me da la sensaciÃ³n de que el juego busca por conexiÃ³n (eso si, el sistema de emparejamiento, no balancea ni aunque sea solamente un poco, en serio, de 10 partidas no he podido ganar ni una, no es normal la cantidad de pedazo de mancos que te tocan en un equipo, que yo no soy ningÃºn pro, pero consigo quedar con proporciones de 1.0-1.2 cuando tengo compaÃ±eros que tienen 0.1 es decir matar 1 y morir 8-9 veces)

En cuanto a nivel tÃ©cnico es bastante sublime, tiene un motor grÃ¡fico propietario de Saber Interactive que ya hemos visto en World War Z que tiene un rendimiento y un desempeÃ±o como pocos, en serio, pocos motores pueden mover tanto enemigo con tanto lujo de detalle y viendose tan bien con un rendimiento tan fluido (y me muero de ganas de que portee a Vulkan como en WWZ que te da sin problemas para jugar en ultra a 180fps seguro)

El sistema de combate cuerpo a cuerpo es muy bueno, con los combos y las esquivas, contraataques etc. El de combate a distancia ya si es algo mÃ¡s normalito y no tiene nada destacable o mencionable frente a cualquier otro shooter, no innova en nada a diferencia del CaC.

Igualmente es un juego bastante redondo, ya digo que tiene algunas carencias en mi opiniÃ³n, cosas que creo que le faltan (que imagino que se irÃ¡n aÃ±adiendo con el tiempo) como algunas armas o facciones ya que la selecciÃ³n de armas es muy pobre y todas se sienten muy parecidas salvo 2 o 3 y JODER DONDE ESTÃN LAS ESCOPETAS, en serio, no se si es que nadie las ha echado en falta o que, pero por si os habÃ©is dado cuenta no hay escopetas (y las hay en el elenco de armas del imperio) ya no hablo de que metan las porras o hachas de energÃ­a (que no estarÃ­a mal ya que el juego solo tiene 3 melÃ©s) pero es que me hace gracia que tienes como 7 rifles bÃ³lter que son el mismo arma con modos de fuego diferentes, 3 pistolas, 2 sniper y 2 armas de energÃ­a.... lo cual me parece un repertorio un poco pobre la verdad.

Otra cosa mala para mi es el multijugador, el de PVP, en serio, me parece lo peor que tiene el juego con diferencia, eso de que sean arenas pequeÃ±as en vez de campos de batalla con multitudes de enemigos que es lo que representa al universo, me parece un FAIL de manual (en mi humilde opiniÃ³n) por que si algo caracteriza al universo de WH40K es lo masivo de sus guerras y sus ejÃ©rcitos, y para mi eso no se ve representado en un mapa canijo en el que se juega un 6vs6 o un 8vs8 etc.

Si te gustan los juegos de Hordas y la ambientaciÃ³n de WH40K adelante, es un muy buen juego, me atrevo a decir que una de las mejores entregas que hemos visto y vamos a ver este 2024, si os gusta el universo, otra joya que veo indispensable es WH40K Darktide donde vais a ver en 1a persona el lado de un soldado en vez del de un marine espacial, ademÃ¡s de que se complementa muy bien con Space Marine 2 por que el juego se desarrolla en otros entornos y contra otras facciones como la plaga de Nurgle.

No soy muy de poner notas a un juego y menos de lanzamiento cuando tiene todo el contenido post-lanzamiento por delante pero le darÃ­a un 7,5-8/10 a Space Marine 2 y no mÃ¡s por que para mi falla bastante en el Multijugador PVP, de verdad que me parece el peor modo del juego y lo que mÃ¡s trabajo necesita para estar a la altura del resto del juego, es un modo bastante olvidable que no aporta nada al nÃºcleo del juego. No innova en nada, y ni siquiera dirÃ­a que es divertido, lo veo anticuado y fuera de esta Ã©poca como concepto y como modo de juego, en cuanto al resto del tÃ­tulo 10/10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Das Spiel ist gut!



- Die Grafik ist Stimmig bis sehr gut.
- Das Movement ist naja.. man kann es aber spielen (Tastenbelegung ist Ã¤nderbar).
- Die Abwechslung kommt gerade zur rechten Zeit, damit man nicht gelangweilt wird.
- Mit guter Hardware lÃ¤uft das Spiel sehr gut! (Mein RIG ist in meinem Profil)

Es kommt trotzdem ein ABER:

ABER ich bin kein Fan dieses Franchises und habe mir so gut wie nichts vorher angesehen, durchgelesen oder angehÃ¶rt und muss einfach, nachdem ich die Story mit einem Kollegen im Koop durchgespielt habe zum Schluss kommen:
FÃ¼r jemanden der sich im Warhammer 40k Universum kaum bis gar nicht auskennt, bleibt am Ende bis auf ein gutes Action-Spiel gar nichts Ã¼brig.

Die Story wird man nicht verstehen, bei den Charakteren weiÃŸ man nicht wer wer ist oder welcher Rang jetzt was ist und so weiter und so weiter. Es bleibt einem einfach nur Ballern Ballern Ballern.

Und ich bin der festen Meinung, das ist auch jedes Mal der Genickbruch dieses eigentlich sehr interessanten Universums. Es reicht in meinen Augen einfach nicht aus, wenn man ab und zu mal Namen nennt, die einem vielleicht gar nichts sagen, dann fÃ¼r sich stehen und dann nicht weiter thematisiert werden.
Ich habe nach Teil 2 erst einmal den ersten Teil gespielt um zu gucken, ob ich einen WOW oder AHA Effekt bekomme, aber es ist in Teil 1 ja noch schlimmer mit den fÃ¼r mich nichts aussagenden EinwÃ¼rfen von Namen.

Wenn ich eine Lore oder ein Universum erst ""Studieren"" muss um eine Story eines einzelnen Spiels zu verstehen, dann ist die verdammt noch mal nicht gut oder nicht gut rÃ¼bergebracht.
Dann ist es einzig und alleine Fanservice und ob das fÃ¼r die breite Masse ausreicht, da habe ich meine Zweifel.

Trotzdem hatte und wer ich noch SpaÃŸ an diesem Spiel haben, so das eine Empfehlung trotz fÃ¼r mich nicht existierender Story noch gerade so gegeben ist.

Gruss

Battle Report: Space Marines 2

From the Desk of Brother-Sergeant Gabriel, 3rd Company, Ultramarines Chapter

Mission Log: 15 Hours In, Campaign Complete

Hail, Brothers and Sisters of the Imperium,

The long-awaited call to arms has been answered. Space Marines 2 has descended upon us like a righteous storm, and after dedicating a solid 15 hours to its campaign and accessories, it is time to deliver our verdict.

Space Marines 2 has risen to meet the high expectations set by its predecessor and then some. The narrative, steeped in the grimdark lore of the 40K universe, unfolds with the gravitas expected of our sacred battlefields. Each mission is a crucible of intensity, keeping the Emperorâ€™s light blazing as you face the myriad horrors that plague the galaxy. The campaign's storyline is robust, providing a compelling blend of heroism and tragedy that befits the grand saga of the Space Marines.

Combat is a symphony of visceral destruction, every engagement a testament to the might of the Adeptus Astartes. The bolterâ€™s roar and the chain sword's hum are rendered with such fidelity that it feels as though youâ€™re wielding these sacred relics yourself. The enemies are varied and formidable, challenging even the most seasoned warriors among us. The improved AI ensures that no battle is ever truly predictable, demanding tactical acumen and reflexes as sharp as a power sword.

Graphically, the game captures the dark majesty of the 40K universe with hauntingly beautiful environments and detailed character models. The ambiance is as oppressive as a Space Hulk, with every setting dripping in the atmosphere of an Imperium on the brink.

In terms of gameplay, the enhancements to combat mechanics and the new abilities granted to our esteemed warriors are noteworthy. The balance between raw power and strategic depth has been finely tuned, allowing us to crush the xenos and heretics with righteous fury.

However, the path of the righteous is not without its trials. There are moments when the mission design feels somewhat formulaic, and a few technical hiccups mar the otherwise flawless execution of this grand endeavor. Yet, these are but minor blemishes on an otherwise gleaming armor of excellence.

In conclusion, Space Marines 2 stands as a proud addition to the legacy of the Warhammer 40K series. It honors our tradition of battle while forging a new path with unwavering zeal. For those who walk the line of the Emperorâ€™s light, this is a battle worth engaging in.

In the Emperor's Name,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very fun gameplay but not worth the $60 they are charging

The campaign takes about 6 to 7 hours to beat which is alright but you don't make any progress towards your classes or weapons in it which is REALLY dumb, the main thing people are going to be doing is trying to is level up their classes to be able unlock armor to make your character look good. The Operations mode is the only mode where you can grind for class levels but sadly there are only 6 missions which they expect you to grind over and over again but in 4 difficulties for 6 classes and 25 levels each. The PvP has it's own leveling system for some reason instead of just going off the operations levels and making it another source of leveling classes. Other than that it's an unbalanced pvp mode with only 3 modes and 3 maps that seems to be added as an after thought.

Could of been GOTY worthy cause of the PvE gameplay if it wasn't for the lack of content, poor performance, bugs, glitches and $60 price tag. I am glad I only paid $49 for this game but even then I feel as if it should have been $30 for the content it has right now.

Some things I like about this is no battlepass and no in game shop. Plus all the content they plan to add is going to be free, so eventually it will have enough content to warrant the $60 price tag.

Space Marine 2 is a good example of what we've lost due to games as a service and predatory monetization schemes, with videogames whose sole purpose of development is to serve as a cosmetics and skins virtual store.
Saber has transported me back to the first decade of the 2000s when video games were just art and pure entertainment. For sure this is not a perfect game, but it is certainly a great one. A solid campaign, cooperative mode and a multiplayer mode, which is simple, but very fun and entertaining, with a progression system and lots of rewards to unlock for free. Just like in the good ol' days.
How good it feels to be able to play a video game with no developer-generated fomo to encourage battle passes sales, with a clear roadmap before release, no microtransactions and no in-game store.
Space Marine 2 is visually amazing with stunning graphics, the combat system is smooth and action packed with a blood and gore feast. I'm playing it on a 3080 with no problems or bugs so far, but I think they can optimize the game even more for my fellow brothers who don't own a beefy GPU.

In summary, a successful game. The worlds are beautifully designed and the story is very well done (what has been released so far).

However, the endgame is very one-sided and currently played through quickly. You now only play to tune your skins a little. Stats/values on the upgrades would have been something else that would have been motivating.

I can currently recommend the game as there is still a lot to be released, but after about 20 hours you have to wait until the new content arrives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imagine ser um Space Marine, uma mÃ¡quina de guerra geneticamente modificada que mistura o Hulk com o Robocop, sÃ³ que com mais mÃºsculos, menos remorso e a capacidade de fazer buracos gigantes em qualquer coisa que ouse existir na sua frente. Agora, adicione um universo onde todo mundo estÃ¡ basicamente tendo o pior dia da sua vida todos os dias, e pronto, vocÃª tem Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2.

Neste jogo, vocÃª Ã© Titus, o Space Marine que jÃ¡ gastou todas as suas fÃ©rias e estÃ¡ eternamente preso em um ciclo de violÃªncia, mas ele nunca reclama, porque reclamar Ã© para os fracos. Seu trabalho? Simples: sobreviver a hordas de alienÃ­genas, demÃ´nios e qualquer outra coisa que o universo cuspa na sua direÃ§Ã£o. Se vocÃª acha que isso soa um pouco estressante, relaxe â€?Titus nÃ£o tem tempo para esses sentimentos. Seu Ãºnico hobby Ã© explodir inimigos com armas que fazem as metralhadoras convencionais parecerem brinquedos de crianÃ§a.

Os grÃ¡ficos sÃ£o tÃ£o detalhados que dÃ¡ pra ver os mÃºsculos das suas veias â€?sim, seus mÃºsculos tÃªm veias prÃ³prias, Ã© assim que os Space Marines rolam. A quantidade de sangue e tripas por pixel Ã© insana, o que faz vocÃª se perguntar: â€œSerÃ¡ que eles tÃªm um departamento de limpeza nos planetas imperiais?â€? Porque sÃ©rio, o lugar fica uma zona toda vez que vocÃª aparece.

A jogabilidade? Simplesmente perfeita se vocÃª gosta de avanÃ§ar sem pensar, explodir coisas e gritar ""PORQUE O IMPERADOR PEDE!"" a cada cinco minutos. Seus oponentes vÃ£o de â€œah, isso foi fÃ¡cilâ€?para â€œespera, isso Ã© uma onda infinita de inimigos?â€? E tudo isso enquanto vocÃª estÃ¡ basicamente fazendo crossfit com armadura e armas que pesam tanto quanto um carro.

Em suma, Ã© como pegar um blockbuster de aÃ§Ã£o dos anos 80, misturar com ficÃ§Ã£o cientÃ­fica hardcore e dar a tudo uma dose de esterÃ³ides. Se vocÃª jÃ¡ sonhou em resolver todos os problemas do universo com uma serra elÃ©trica gigante, este Ã© o jogo para vocÃª. E lembre-se: no futuro sombrio do 41Âº milÃªnio, nÃ£o hÃ¡ tempo para terapia... sÃ³ para carnificina.

E no final das contas, quando vocÃª Ã© esmagado por um TiranÃ­deo gigantesco, hÃ¡ uma satisfaÃ§Ã£o estranha em gritar com orgulho: ""PELO IMPERADOR!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My Name Is Jefftor,Recommended,70.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheVoidOfJefftor/,"Posted: September 12
After reading the negative reviews and assessing their statements, I have decided I should write a review.
One of the biggest complaints I saw was people complaining that the 2 highest difficulties of the campaign ""Require"" Co-Op. Whether it was because missions were hard, the AI was incompetent, or enemies took too many bullets to kill, requiring you to use a ""Janky"" melee system. I beat the campaign on the highest difficulty solo; one of my friends beat the campaign solo on that difficulty as well. News flash. A co-op game is usually balanced around playing co-op with either friends or other people.
The second complaint I saw was the game being ""stiff"" or ""unresponsive"" and the combat being janky. The combat is supposed to feel slow. Poorly timed dodges and parries are punished. Spamming attacks are supposed to be unrewarding at best and punished at worst. People kept mentioning that they can't cancel a dodge. I didn't even know that was a normal feature in games. Usually you press the button, action happens, and then you resume. Sometimes games will let you ""Cancel"" something if it's a long action like a reload or mantling a ledge.
PVP isn't super unbalanced. There are some tweaks that need to be made, but on the whole it's enjoyable as long as your teammates realize this isn't a normal shooter. It's more akin to CS or Valorant. You want to play with your team and play Objectives. A solo player can pop off, but more often than not, a solo player gets caught out and killed quickly.
To the people who are saying this is another ""short life"" game because it has low re-playability. Unlike a lot of other games that are trying to be in this space, it has a road map. We know what's coming and when to expect it. Thats more than I can say for a lot of games like this.

To wrap it all in a nice bow. Remember, other games exist. Go play them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've played a couple other Warhammer games before but this one so far is my favorite. There are a couple things I'm not a fan of like the defense objective in one of the early missions and managing ammo especially in certain encounters but overall It's a really fun game. Looking forward to seeing what they add to it in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great story and the multiplayer is fun and challenging! Haven't tried PVP but from what i can tell the ttk is in a nice spot and can add some more life to the game. If the Devs can keep a steady stream of content then i can see this game doing really well. If not, for those who seek a more PVE style of game play, they might burn out pretty quick due to the repetitious nature of the multiplayer operations, even though the enemies are procedural (kinda), the mission objectives can get a little stale. However, the progression system and different classes help for those who seek to grind like i do, i can see myself easily putting 100+ hours chasing those levels and gear. Lastly, the campaign took me about 8 hours on normal and that's with exploring every nook for hidden data pads on normal but by the end you'll be shouting ""FOR THE EMPEROR!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TLDR: Game is very good, GOTY for me.

As an enjoyer of 40k its nice to be eating good again.

This is a masterpiece, I haven't played a game that has made me this happy in a long time. The gameplay, the lore, the graphics, all of it sings of love and care. This game has so many little details that have made me and my friends stop and appreciated them (not mentioning which in order to avoid spoiling).

The gameplay is visceral and responsive, simple to pick up but with some dept to it.
The lore, according to my more learned friends as I am but a novice in the 40k ways, is very good, and they took great care with some details.
And the graphics are beautiful, the contrast between the amazing visceral displays in combat and the beautiful but war thorn landscape around is amazing.

This topped off with non-predatory monetisation, only cosmetics can be bought, and even then there are plenty to earn in game, the future updates are free and will bring so many wonderful things is such a breath of fresh air.

I know some people had a couple of bugs, and I too experienced some, nothing game breaking, but some crashes and some goofy physics in cutscenes. I am hoping today's patch addressed that for new players.

From the moment you step into your power armor, youâ€™re no longer just a human, youâ€™re a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?walking cathedral of destruction, blessed by the Emperorâ€™s divine will. Xenos? Heretics? Chaos-worshipping filth? Theyâ€™re not your enemies, theyâ€™re your next target practice. Reload, deliver, and repeat until the galaxy is cleansed.

The Combat
Itâ€™s pure, undiluted rage made flesh. You donâ€™t just kill your enemies, you annihilate them with every pull of the trigger, as if the Emperor himself is screaming â€œPurge harder!â€?in your ears!

It's simple, if itâ€™s not human, it dies. You donâ€™t need context or a reason; theyâ€™re xenos, they exist, thatâ€™s enough to condemn them. You are the Emperorâ€™s fist, and the galaxy is your punching bag.

Clunky, Awkward, frustrating.

Warhammer Space Marine 2 ist ein fantastisches Spiel, das in fast allen Bereichen Ã¼berzeugt. Die Grafik ist beeindruckend, die Sounds sind stimmig, und die Waffen fÃ¼hlen sich einfach groÃŸartig an. Ich habe die Kampagne auf der hÃ¶chsten Schwierigkeit durchgespielt und aktuell zwei Charaktere â€?einen Verteidiger und einen ZerstÃ¶rer â€?auf Level 25.

Die Kampagne ist hervorragend umgesetzt und fÃ¤ngt die dÃ¼stere, epische AtmosphÃ¤re von Warhammer perfekt ein. Man fÃ¼hlt sich wirklich wie ein Teil dieses riesigen Universums â€?einfach fantastisch. Auch die Koop-Missionen sind sehr gelungen und machen eine Menge SpaÃŸ, allerdings sind die Chaos-Missionen noch etwas unausgewogen.

Der PvP-Modus ist unterhaltsam, aber es gibt noch Luft nach oben. Mit nur drei Spielmodi und etwa fÃ¼nf Maps ist das Angebot noch recht begrenzt. Zudem fehlt es den Chaos Marines an Anpassungsoptionen, was dem PvP etwas an Tiefe nimmt. Hier sehe ich die grÃ¶ÃŸte SchwÃ¤che des Spiels.

Das Spiel lÃ¤uft auÃŸerdem extrem stabil. In meiner gesamten Spielzeit hatte ich nur einen einzigen Bug, aber keinen Absturz oder sonstige Probleme â€?es ist wirklich sehr gut optimiert.

An alle, die sich beschweren, dass es keine Pronomen, Frauen, LGBTQ+ oder andere ReprÃ¤sentationen gibt: Im echten Leben kÃ¶nnt ihr all das gerne so ausleben, wie ihr wollt, aber in Warhammer geht es nur um Krieg! Lasst das Universum so, wie es seit den 90ern ist. Wenn es euch nicht passt, sucht euch bitte etwas anderes und lasst uns unser Warhammer so lieben, wie es ist: dÃ¼ster und gnadenlos. DARK and GRIM.

Trotz kleinerer MÃ¤ngel ist Warhammer Space Marine 2 ein groÃŸartiges Spiel, das ich jedem Fan des Universums oder Action-Gamern wÃ¤rmstens empfehlen kann.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

O jogo nÃ£o vale R$200,00.
Pagaria no mÃ¡ximo R$100,00 por ele.

* O jogo estÃ¡ extremamente repetitivo, apenas 6 mapas para um farm gigantesco.

* A quantidade de bosses no jogo Ã© mÃ­nima, e praticamente todos tem as mesmas skills.

* O jogo nÃ£o tem um equilÃ­brio descente entre os mobs, seja minions ou mobs maiores. Os minions dÃ£o dano igual ou superior ao dos bichos maiores.

* O jogo nÃ£o te da informaÃ§Ã£o suficiente relacionado as evoluÃ§Ãµes das armas, deixando um limbo gigantesco nesse sentido.

* As informaÃ§Ãµes sobre o poder de fogo das armas nÃ£o parece estar certo. VocÃª coloca elas no lvl mÃ¡ximo e quando usa elas em lvls mais baixos, preciso dar a mesma qtdade de tiros ainda para matar os mobs.

* O esquema de esquiva e bloqueio do jogo precisa ser aperfeiÃ§oado.

* A skill do assaulto estÃ¡ uma avacalhaÃ§Ã£o, as vezes funciona, as vezes nÃ£o. O que acaba te levando a morte em algumas situaÃ§Ãµes no jogo.

* Ou vocÃª joga com a arma melta, ou vocÃª nÃ£o faz conteÃºdo endgame.

* Assault tem uma vantagem que diz: Ao realizar ataques carregados, vc n perde o controle ao sofrer golpes pesados e nÃ£o pode ser empurrado. Mesmo com essa skill ativa, vc Ã© empurrado e perde o controle TODA VEZ, inclusive por minions.

* Os nÃ­veis de dificuldade deveriam ter um lvl mÃ­nimo para entrar. Muito player querendo rushar lvl e querendo ser carregado em dificuldade mais alta. Atrapalha demais o jogo ao invÃ©s de ajudar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The style of the game is on point with satisfying gameplay, but it has some GLARING issues. I'd recommend it, but I hope it gets some polish soon!

Pros:
Style: The feel of the 40k universe is really hit on the head. This alone has probably gotten me through the game. I just really adore it.
Audio: Crunchy sound design is very satisfying.
Weapons: The gear you use feels pretty good, the design is limited, but it's loyal to the universe.
Gameplay: Fairly rhythmic fighting with parries, counters & dodges.
Big enemies: Boss fights can be tough ( Angel of Death difficulty ), but typically manageable ( caveat below ).
Story: The story is a bit shallow, but good enough.

Cons:
The most glaring issue is ally AI. It's horrendous, pathetically bad. This can make some boss fights an absolute slog when you're trying to balance yourself to proceed through the fight. It also destroys immersion seeing an Astartes knuckle f***ing himself in the corner while you're fighting for your life.
Hit boxes: The hit boxes are bad. You'll get hit at bizarre ranges & you'll often shoot invisible walls when attacking enemies. I've also been struck countless times through cover from ranged attacks.
Homing Melee Attacks: One the most annoying things in this game is enemies leaping at you ( not talking about parry counters ) & having them turn in the air or have them YA YEET themselves after you when you dodge.
Stun Lock: Though I understand it's a swarm hitting you & that's sort of the point, getting stun locked is just a poor choice. No one likes stun lock. No one likes losing control of their character. No one wants to have 2/3 of their health gone from 3 gaunts.

Edit:

Tacked on Feature: After finally playing the PvP I gotta' say it's pretty dog-sh*t. The fact that you have to re-level up just to use weapons is a very brain-dead decision. It's artificial play time that should not exist in a game where PvP feels like a tack-on to begin with. Being dumped into games where the majority of my team is > Level 10 & the opponents are < Level 20 is laughable. Less options, less-powerful gear ( in some aspects ) & less experience vs a team higher in all regards. Trashy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-linear gameplay
-a melee combat game with guns
-wanabe souls game with the parry/dodge mechanic
-no character progression, no leveling, no gear
-no armor/gear except for default weapons and unlocked weapons from story
-combat is slow, why slow run and fast run? just do fast run as default
-guns do not feel good, low ammo, hard to find ammo at times
-melee base combat but no weapon skills just some clunky multi-hit combo
-generic melee weapons, generic guns
-not enough health kits, not enough ammo on some fights
-sucks playing solo, you get swarmed fast
-have to switch between gun mode and melee mode, this feels so bad. Gun mode locks you into zoomed-in 3rd person ADS
-can't tell if there's different classes, everyone looks the same
-dodge roll spam

Space Marine 2 offers a great blend of PVE and PVP action, as well as a compelling story, once again featuring Demetrian Titus of the Ultramarines. If you're a fan of the Warhammer 40,000 IP, you're going to love it. If you're just getting into this IP, buckle up and enjoy! For the Emperor!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Space Marine 2 is a long-awaited, much-hoped-for sequel to the first Space Marine game. You play as <REDACTED> (jk it's freaking Titus like that wasn't obvious enough) who starts off using Primaris-styled equipment as a regular first-born marine. Hmm. Can't say that's particularly lore accurate, but whatever, it's Titus so that's cool. Unfortunately he's no Mark Strong this time, can't blame him after everything that happened. Be aware.

I tried playing the campaign missions on Angel of Death difficulty. This will color my breakdown below.

The 'nids are, as expected, annoying ass space bugs that swarm you faster than skaven do at a Warpstone rave party, and they're fairly dangerous. In fact, each of them individually might not seem like a problem but start throwing in 3 or so hormagaunts and you'll start having more stab wounds than a mugging victim in London. The termagaunts, those little annoying freaking shooty bugs, appear to not wield regular fleshborers, since the damn things flash green like miniature rapid-fire venom cannons. If you don't know what a venom cannon is, I'll explain it further down below in the Warrior section.

All of these swarm mechanics overwhelming you through sheer numbers is really pronounced. I started having to take engagements carefully and seriously right from the get-go. You can't regenerate any health from simple executions this time either, you need to have taken damage recently (a la Bloodborne) and this makes Titus not only feel like tissue paper, but unable to recover easily. You need to use the medical stims and those are far and few in between, so they definitely took the 'its too easy' critique about the first game too much to heart. Titus will find these enemies dangerous and annoying in equal measure as a result, so don't go thinking you can charge into the jaws of hell and not get tarpitted harder than Abbadon facing a 50 block of guardsmen backed up by a Commissar Lord. They are just as fearless as said guardsmen and unlike Abbadon, Titus can't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out like 10 attacks in a single round of combat, so you better hope you're good at parrying.

Note that while parrying or dodging or attacking, you are more or less animation locked. You can't cancel easily, and this honestly makes you feel a lot more sluggish than Captain Titus, who is now obviously the best version of Titus there was. This means you have to thin their numbers at range, hopefully reducing the 'gaunt variants down to less than 3 by the time the Warrior rushes you down.

Let's talk about Warriors. Warriors are the big 'nids that have that annoying ass whip, that annoying ass paired boneswords, that really annoying ass devourer, or that annoying ass venom cannon (that long snout thing).
The Whip is not too bad in a 1 on 1, just make sure to either stay clear of it while wiping out the small forms or...dunno, charge in and beat it to death before it can get really annoying. When it does that lash combo attack, it's very hard to parry so you're better off just trying to keep your distance and shooting it down.
The twin boneswords is just tanky. That's it.
The devourer is basically a rapid-fire fleshborer, and the Warrior who uses it is the most irritating PoS you will ever encounter. It will constantly skate away to the backline to pepper you with clusters of projectiles and it adds up a lot of damage very fast. Snipe this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as soon as possible. If you try to close in melee, it will sometimes unload every shot into you at point-blank range and you can die from this.
The last one, the venom cannon wielder, is the sniper variant. A venom cannon is like a biological railgun except instead of shooting a metal projectile it shoots this venomous acidic crystal that is superheated by the electrical discharge (yes, this is how it works in lore) and is launched at high speed to penetrate vehicles...or something. It didn't really work against real vehicles, but it definitely works against MEQ (shorthand for 'marine equivalent') like Titus. You will get a warning in the form of a sickly green laser tracking you and you can dodge the shot quite easily with good timing. The real problem is when one of them shows up and you are fighting a swarm or two and their Warrior melee cousins all at the same time, which is when things get nasty. Even then, its particular attacks are not hard to avoid, so either trust in your mobility or kill them off first, your choice.

There's more bug variants and their stupid tactics but I'm tired of talking about bugs so let's talk about weapons.

Gunplay and melee aren't mutually exclusive, it retains the general fluidity of the first game and you can swap between the two styles of combat very fast. Pistols are actually useful, they take their own slot and can help offset some disadvantages of your primary, while also serving as a way to perform kill shots on parried enemies.

Bolters. Holy Emperor the bolters. There are so many bolter variants, and some of them being very cross purposes with their actual function to the point it makes you wonder who needs this many variants. They are all lifted from the Primaris arsenal, and you get the whole freaking line of them (except Assault Bolters). Bolt carbines, heavy bolt pistols, auto bolt rifles, you name it they have it. In fact, I would argue that there are simply too many bolters. In the first game most of the same roles were replicated by unique weapons, such as the plasma gun, the lascannon, the vengeance launcher, and so on. Now you get...bolters.

Some of them are effective and some are not, but all of them are only average on Angel of Death difficulty so I didn't really find them to be that unique. What stood out were the non-bolter weapons, the Plasma Incinerator and the Melta Rifle.
The Plasma Incinerator is like a cross between the regular plasma gun and a very small plasma cannon, and it performs well enough in that role. It's plasma and it hurts.
The Melta Rifle is basically just like the melta gun from the first game. Tight AOE cone that does more damage the closer to the center of the aiming circle you get, huge shotgun blast that can melt anything.
There's some other stuff like the Las Fusil, which is basically just a lascannon if they scaled it down and in-game it's basically a Charge Rifle from Titanfall. It's still a good weapon, but they clearly learned their lesson from the first game where the lascannon's instant shot could utterly destroy an unfortunate enemy's face at close range.

Melee weapons unfortunately all feel a little samey. The chainsword is effective but it only swings in tight arcs and relies on a charge attack combo to stun enemies, which is extremely awkward compared to the first game where your stun/charge attack was another key altogether. This means it is very easy to start a chainsword combo then get hit for your trouble because you have no way of interrupting your enemy.
The power sword is a little more forgiving as it has actual stances that emphasize AOE or single target combat. It still has the issue of not being able to stagger big creatures reliably, or having a charge attack combo that matters, but it is reliable enough with its large sweeping attacks to actually outperform the chainsword on a regular basis.
The thunder hammer took a big hit from last game. It is just as sluggish and slow despite Titus' better augmentations, but is weaker. You can put a lot of hurt on enemies, but you have too many gaps open that leave you unable to defend yourself properly. Compare that to the first game, where the hammer's instant-kill damage and reliable stun combo can AOE wipe out hordes of daemons or whatever. It's very weak in this game.
The power fist staggers most enemies. Good enough.

So Is game gud? yes. Get. Play. Keel bug.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jogo maravilhoso, fluido, combate frenÃ©tico, violÃªncia sem limites, combos e execuÃ§Ãµes fantÃ¡sticos, muito ritmo nas batalhas, missÃµes interessantes, ambientaÃ§Ã£o do jogo Ã© fantÃ¡stica, principalmente na base dos Space Marines. Ã‰ bem sinistro passar e olhar um Dreadnought e saber que tem um cara enterrado vivo ali dentro, sabendo que ele nunca mais vai sair de lÃ¡ da sua tumba ambulante onde ele verÃ¡ o mundo somente atravÃ©s de sensores e armado atÃ© os dentes e pronto para a batalha. O visual dos personagens Ã© uma obra de arte, desde os detalhes da armadura atÃ© o brilho, cores e os desenhos e dizeres que ela contÃ©m. Jjogando em uma RTX 3060 + CPU Core i5 11400 F + SSD 1 TB NVME da Kingston, com tudo no Alto, Monitor Quad HD com DLSS ativado o jogo roda em 67/80 FPS sem stuttering. NÃ£o tive nenhuma experiÃªncia ruim com bugs no jogo, estÃ¡ rodando liso, sem falhas, pelo menos comigo a experiÃªncia foi boa. Joguei atÃ© a fase do Jump Pack, o que dÃ¡ cerca de 4,5 horas de jogo. CenÃ¡rios gigantescos e controles precisos (estou jogando com o dual sense do PS5) e dÃ¡ pra sentir a sensaÃ§Ã£o o peso da armadura do personagem, a sensaÃ§Ã£o de quando corre, assim como o tiro das armas com os gatilhos adaptativos, o reload dos armamentos, os impactos das granadas numa batalha visceral e sangrenta, tudo para saciar a sede de quem quer um bom jogo de tiro, porrada e bomba contra os Aliens que continuam vindo incessantemente criando estratÃ©gias de ataque contra vocÃª, cercando pelos flancos e tudo mais, comandados por chefes, sub-chefes, batalhas Ã©picas com Bosses, enfim, sÃ³ tenho elogios para esse jogo.

IF YOU SUFFER FROM MOTION SICKNESS THIS MIGHT NOT BE YOUR GAME.
if you DO NOT suffer from motion sickness then this game is metal af. buy it lol.

the narrow fov with no adjustability is the only deal breaking issue i have with the game. i dont wanna give the game a bad review because the other aspects of the game are great, BUT its basically unplayable for me.
i can only play for about 2 hours on my desktop setup before i had stop because i was becoming physically ill.

However playing on my htpc setup with a 50â€?tv several feet away is tolerable.

in 2024, an fov slider is a basic QOL option for most people and for some (like me) is a legit accessibility option that makes the game playable.
not having an fov slider is like not having subtitles for the hearing impaired.

IF an fov slider is added i will update my review to positive cause the rest of the game is alot of fun

NOTE: im aware that there are fov fixes/mods but i shouldn't need to jump through hoops to enjoy the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incredible game, 9/10 cannot recommend enough.

It would be a 10/10 Emperor mandated purchase but there were a few gamebreaking bugs that me and my friend encountered during our playthrough that made us have to restart several times.

The pvp is skill based and requires you to move as a unit like OG halo multiplayer and the movement feels a lot like gears of war minus the cover to cover aspect of moving in that game.

The Campaign immediately entered my top 5 best campaigns along with Halo and Last of Us. The final missions is pure unfiltered fan service and I couldn't get enough of it.

The Scenarios are also awesome and provide a good bit of replay-ability with the perks and cosmetic unlocks and each class feels powerful in their own right.

One of my personal favorite things in this game has to be NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS!!!

All in all its an amazing game that I'm having a ton of fun with and i even have zero regrets when it comes to purchasing the early access either which is the first time I have done so in years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really hate to do this so early on, but out of my alleged 2 hours of ""playtime"", only 20-30 minutes has actually been in control of a Space Marine. I'm not joking when I say I've simply started scrolling through twitter and watching whole YouTube videos whilst waiting for things to load, and it also turns out that despite having downloaded the game for no less than 4 hours, I am SOMEHOW missing some ""Epic Games Multiplayer Files"". For some reason, loading into the Campaign requires connecting to a server, and basically every single cut-scene has either frozen itself partway through, has had such delayed audio that it's genuinely confusing as to who's saying what unless you have Subtitles on, or flat out just crashes the game. That half an hour I've actually been able to play the game was fun, I admit, but that simply does NOT excuse how everything outside of the gameplay seems to have been handled.

Oh, and on a separate note, a friend of mine from the UK wanted me to gift this for them when it released today and I couldn't due to ""Regional Price differences"". Turns out that people in the UK are paying what is effectively an extra $12 in USD for this game compared to Americans, so please do note that if you are from that region across the big pond.

Edit: Game seems to be running a lot better now, so now that I can physically play the video game I'm changing the review. Price difference still seems to be an issue, though, so make of it what you will.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Emperor's name, Space Marine 2 is a hymn to war, drenched in the blood of xenos heretics.

The combat is as brutal and unyielding as the Imperium itself, though mission variety and accessibility are as scarce as an untainted world in the 41st Millennium.

Pros:
Sehr gute Grafik, brutal, nicht zu einfach und nicht zu schwierig, gute customization, kaum Bugs und nichts was das Game breaken kÃ¶nnte, ein sich gut anfÃ¼hlendes Kampfsystem mit geilen Kontern und Finishern, viel frei zu spielen, bombastische Inszenierung, Performance ist selbst auf Ã¤lteren Systemen noch spielbar dank DLSS und auch Lossless Scaling(es ist auch ohne LS spielbar aber ich bin eine FPS-Ho3)

Contra:
kurze Story(6 Missionen die jeweils ca 1h lang sind), kein Widescreen-Support(Ã¤ndert sich bald schon), erstmal nur 6 PvE Missionen(wieder ca 45-1h lang und an sich gehÃ¶ren sie auch zur Story sollen aber dieses Jahr noch mehr kommen laut Roadmap), falls du auch ne Fps-Ho3 bist brauchst du Lossless Scaling(auÃŸer du hast ne 3070+), relativ repetetive ohne Hordemodus, Crossplay fÃ¼hrt noch zu langen Ladezeiten, Server sind noch nicht perfekt

Fazit: ne gute 7.5, wenn noch mehr Content kommt wahrscheinlich 8-9

Specs: rtx 2080, r5 7600
Ich nutze Losless Scaling und DLSS(QualitÃ¤t) um auf simulierten 150 fps zu spielen

Anmerkung: Ich schreibe diese Rezension aus der Sicht von Jemandem der kein Warhammer Fan ist/war. FÃ¼r Warhammer Fans ist das hier wahrscheinlich noch ein grÃ¶ÃŸeres Fest",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warhammer 40k : Space Marine 2

KÃ¶telezÅ‘ darab konkrÃ©tan mindenkinek aki szereti magÃ¡t a Warhammer vilÃ¡gÃ¡t fÅ‘leg , de aki 1 tartalmas jÃ¡tÃ©kra vÃ¡gyik Ã©s a mindennapi stresszt kÃ­vÃ¡nja levezetni 1 gyors kikapcsolÃ³ darÃ¡lÃ¡ssal annak is Ã©rdemes rÃ¡nÃ©znie. Nem fog csalÃ³dni .....

KampÃ¡ny kicsit rÃ¶vid , de tartalmas mindamellett Co-op ban is kitolhatÃ³ mÃ¡sik 2 haverral , Ã©s ha kivÃ©geztÃ©tek a fÅ‘ szÃ¡lat akkor jÃ¶n a lÃ©nyeg merthogy a kampÃ¡ny az igazÃ¡bÃ³l csak a bemelegÃ­tÃ©s kedvcsinÃ¡lÃ³ ha Ãºgy tetszik.

Co-op kÃ¼ldik van a jÃ¡tÃ©knak 1 rÃ©sze amit a Warhammer 40k Darktide hoz tudnÃ©k legjobban hasonlÃ­tani csak Space Marinokkal. 6 kÃ¼lÃ¶nÃ¡llÃ³ kaszt szintezhetÅ‘, testre szabhatÃ³ mind kÃ¼lsÅ‘leg mind belsÅ‘leg jelenleg 6 kÃ¼lÃ¶nbÃ¶zÅ‘ pÃ¡lyÃ¡n, Ã©s kÃ¼lÃ¶n nehÃ©zsÃ©gi fokozatokon 3 fÅ‘s csapatokban. Nem mellesleg van a jÃ¡tÃ©kban PC-konzol crossplatform

I have been hoping for a sequel for space marine for 11 years, I have been waiting for this to release for 2 years. Does it deliver? I will explain below, starting with the campaign, then the MP modes ending on the technical details and overall thoughts.

Campaign


Space Marine 2 puts you into the armour of a Space Marine 40.000 years into the future. A genetically engineered super soldier that is 3 metres tall, a space marine is almost indestructible, they are faster and stronger than any normal human and some of them can be hundreds of years old. They are wrapped in myth and legend and are skilled warriors beyond measure. They are a bulwark against terror in a universe that has known only war for centuries.

Humanity is fighting against horrors beyond their comprehension and while there are several factions of said horrors, the main one we're dealing with here, is a Tyranid Hive fleet.
Tyranids are a bug/lizard like faction that swarm the universe to consume biomass, they evolve at an incredibly fast rate and can counter almost any known weapon or biological agent known to mankind and speed is of the essence when dealing with them. A planet attacked by them never truly recovers and there are millions and millions gunning for you.

The story picks up quite some time after Space Marine 1, and you are Titus. While I won't go into much story detail. The tutorial and thus the introduction to Space Marine 2, immediately shows what stakes you're up against and sets the tone for the entire campaign.

The campaign is a great introduction to some of the scale that Warhammer 40K offers and its bleak hopeless setting, there is only war and it shows. The campaign is filled with gigantic set pieces, wild lush alien forests and jungles, gigantic cities with massive cathedrals or abandoned bunkers and dark secrets. Everywhere you see signs of the carnage that happens all around you and the grimdark setting that 40K invented really shines here.

Gameplay wise the game is reminiscent of Space Marine 1, just improved upon. combat is fast and diverse and the game expects you to switch tactics on the fly.

As a space marine you have a great arsenal of weapons to use, from the infamous Bolt weapons, massive assault weapons that fire a bolt, a massive rocket propelled round that embeds itself in the target and detonates, to melta guns, plasma guns, heavy bolters. But you also have several melee weapons, from the Chainsword, to the Thunderhammer. Why? because the combat in this games switches between thinning out hordes and hordes of enemies before they reach you and then turns into a hack and slash brawler fest.

The combat is incredibly dynamic and it keeps you on your toes especially on higher difficulties. Luckily you are not alone in this rigorous slaughter fest. Titus has two other space marines with him, which can either be controlled by your friends or the computer. While the bots lack some finesse and tend to focus on direct threats, they are a welcome addition. Just don't expect too much of them, they are bots. they beeline for you to get you up if you're down but not out and they can distract some enemies.

The campaign will take you around 10 to 12 hours to complete and my time with it was enjoyed very much, I had several ""Holy sh!t"" moments and I felt like a space marine, the story is all I hoped for after 13 years and I loved it.


The multiplayer is the other part of Space Marine 2. It can be separated in two parts: PVE and PVP.


PVE is one of the parts that shines here, during the campaign several squads often help Titus with secondary objectives, the PVE or Operations gives you control of these squads. You can run this with up to two of your friends or bots, but trust me, play with friends.

You have six classes with each of them having a distinct role, weapon set and main ability.
From the standard space marine with bolter and chainsword, to the bulwark with shield and sword to a stealthy sniper

Each class has weapon upgrades, perks for the weapons and the class itself and customisation to unlock.
Yes you can create your very own space marine or unlock several other space marine chapters and customise those and while the customisation needs some polish, it's incredibly varied.

There are currently six operations most of which coincide with the campaign, they can take 30 to 45 minutes to complete and on higher difficulties they require coordination, tactics and sharing of resources.

They often feel like mini raids and they are incredibly fun to do, however in contrast to games such as Darktide I wonder how fun these missions stay, they feel less like a horde shooter and more like a mini campaign, while enemy variety and objectives can switch around in an operation, I feel it might get repetitive. Yet they are like I said incredibly fun and I will probably keep coming back to them, just because of the gameplay loop.


The second MP mode is Eternal War, a 6v6 PVP mode with the same classes as the Operations mode, just different progression. There three modes, King of the Hill, Seize ground (several points to capture) and Annihilation (team death match) and as of writing 3 maps.

The gameplay in pvp is great, classes are diverse and while some balancing might be happening it is incredibly fun to play despite it's lack of maps and modes. I spend several hours playing this and the tactical aspect in it is really fun, it isn't just run and gun, you have to counter other classes, bullwarks can block damage, snipers sneak around, assault's jump in to cut you down. There are tons of cool skirmishes to be found and it's an absolute blast.

However it's also the most bare bones part of the game. While the customisation for space marines is great, the chaos marines lack customisation, every class is attached to a traitor legion and is thus bound to it. You cannot play an iron warrior vanguard for instance and the armor itself is barely customisable, sometimes even not. For some of the more chaos minded players this can be quite a big letdown.

The other issue is that while it is 6v6 I can only make a lobby with three people, not six or four, locking out some of my friends to play with, I get it for PVE, I don't for PVP.

PVP feels like something added later in development and I hope that the devs do expand upon it with some much needed Quality of Life changes.


The game is quite CPU heavy, I have a i9-10850k CPU and a RTX4070 TI SUPER, the game runs like a charm in 90% of the game, but some areas and missions are incredible heavy on the CPU so much I wonder if it's a bit of optimalisation. Some area's that are small tank my frames, while some large open areas I run at a solid 80 FPS on ultra settings.

Besides that though, the game is beautiful to look at and effects, lighting, textures are all incredibly impressive, from the sparks of a broken cable to the blood that flies around.

The sound design is really well done and weapon sounds pack the punch you expect them to, every bolt fired, every enemy screech, every punch thrown is of high quality and this combined with the graphical design makes this a very immersive 40K game.


Despite some personal gripes and an in my opinion a bare bones PVP, this game has been worth the wait, it build upon the foundation of Space Marine 1 and improved it immensely. It offers something for older fans and something for newer fans of 40K and it is an incredible home-coming or introduction to the Space Marine franchise and thus Warhammer 40.000. It's an incredibly brutal, fun third person action game and the gameplay loop is quite addicting.

Sabre shows it understands 40K and this game is an ode to it.

PVE: 9/10
PVP 8/10
Graphics 9/10

Campaign: one of the best I've played in recent memory - this is the only part I can recommend
PvE: repetitive and loses steam after about 3 runs of each map
PvP: not my jam, no opinion, have not played

Overall the combat and general gameplay is some of the most satisfying I've seen since something like Gears but without all the cover nonsense and the first run of the campaign has some real jaw dropping moments in both visuals and reveals.

However, if you're looking for more than the campaign, this is hard to recommend. Much like Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood, World War Z, Darktide, etc, there's just nothing to do in the PvE Operations mode except grind out cosmetics and passives. That might be enough for some, but it lacks any of the systems that make something like Destiny, Warframe, Deep Rock Galactic, Remnant, or the plethora of other rougelikes out there that do so much with mapgen and other secondary systems that make each run feel like a run, not just going through the same motions again. I'm never excited by anything that's gonna drop from a mission, it's just ""cross the finish line this many times"" for your next passive/cosmetic.

Cosmetics are awesome, classes are fine, progression kinda sucks since you only unlock one row at a time. Not sure I'll be playing long enough to max a single class despite only playing two of them. Passives are... there? They all feel like relatively minor gameplay bonuses that help steer your playstyle, but not one so far has made me excited to unlock or feel it was worth working towards. They feel more like bypasses to some inconvenince rather than some Astartes-level power. I don't think I'd be able to tell an endgame level build from an early game one from gameplay alone.

Would be awesome if in new game + you could play the campaign with your custom marine so 60% of the PvE missions were playable with the PvE classes. I think that's my biggest issue, the best PvE content isn't what you get to replay for progression and what's there to replay gets stale fast. Really hope to see some updates to the operations modes that make them more fun to replay. Modifiers, loot drops that persist after a play session, consumable buffs, unique mission rewards, map variants, mapgen, really anything except playing the same mission over and over with some different combat pacing each time.

If campaigns are your jam, pick it up on sale. If you wanted something more replayable, wait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Victorus aut mortis

This review is coming from a perspective of a 40k fan. I am relatively new though, only 5 years ago did I discover this universe, which is quite recent for a universe thats been around since 1987. Since my intoduction I have several painted armies (a space marine one among them) alongside having played some games and listened to a lot of Warhammer books and lore over the years.

Warhammer 40K : Space Marine 2 is a game that absolutely delivers on the experience it was aiming to create while going above and beyond for some aspects while fumbling tiny things along the way. I am pointing this out because this is getting increasingly unusual in the game industry nowadays. Most games coming out trying to sell you a live service while the game is not finished enough to be able to do so. Meanwhile this dev team seems to have taken their time to release a complete product that gives a solid foundation to making a live service work. 3 separate modes, all with a different focus and gameplay experience. Its quite refreshing, but that does not make the game automatically perfect. Lets talk about all of these modes and my thoughts on them.

Campaign: (no spoilers)

This mode continues the story of Demitrian Titus, the protagonist of the first game, with a fancy new narrative 13 years after the games release. Just like the other modes, you can play this mode cooperatively with 2 of your friends, and does a nice job introducing the mechanics of the game in a fun way. The campaign itself is short but sweet, and intentionally tries not to drag on to long, which is good in my opinion because you can't do much character work with a space marine because they are emotionless supersoldiers. The appeal of the campaign are the missions, and the set pieces within them. The 40k universe is bombastic yet intriguing and mysterious, and watching Titus and his team fight through futuristic gothic cities actively being destroyed by the tyranid invasion one moment and navigating through his chapters space ship with tons of details and lore is really fun and engaging. Its like a rollercoaster ride of the 40k universe where they show a lot of the unique and awesome stuff this universe has to offer. I do think it would have been smart of explain some more concepts, especially the ones directly related to the story's plot. A lot of times characters talk about in universe concepts, and people who are new to 40K will just not understand because its never explained. Its tottally playable and comprehensible to a person new going in, but I think its important to explain more stuff to really get them excited about the nuance 40k has compared to other sci-fi universes.

PVE Operations:
This mode allows your to play several missions losely related to the campaign story. Instead of Titus and his squad, you'll be able to play as 6 different classes, and make your own Space Marine. You'll be able to fully customize the look of your character, while completing missions allows you to level up and access new perks and abilities to make your guy stronger over time and really pick a playstyle you like. For 40k fans this is a dream come true since building and painting miniatures is a huge part of this hobby and the amount of customization is pretty vast for game that has just released. Its also not tied to microtransactions and all of the customization (except for a couple skins related to the gold and ultra edition) are earnable through playing the game. No ingame cash shop or lootboxes. The gamemode focusses on replayability with a good variety of maps, enemies and classes alongside the 4, soon to be 5 difficulties, makes it enjoyable over a long period of time. There is also an AI director tha mixes the missions up and tries to suprise you with changes in the enemies that show up and the objectives you must complete along the way. I have some issues with balancing though. The hardest difficulty feels very unstable to play right now, it feels you need to get lucky in order to win, but itâ€™s very satisfying once you do. I also think the Thousand Sons faction are not very fun to fight currently of the way the units are balanced, totally fixable though. Focus has already promised to add more missions, weapons and enemies in the future which will be important to its life service, which in my opinion has the most potential in this game mode.

PVP Eternal War:

I played the least amount of PVP up until now, but it has pleasantly surprised me. Itâ€™s structured as a 6vs6 contest where Space Marines go up against Chaos Space Marines, marines who have betrayed the imperium and have sided with the bad guys. There are a couple modes to pick from, and they are all good fun to play with the same 6 classes from PVE. There only 3 maps though, and unlike the Campaign and PVE, there is not a lot of spectacle going on around or inside of them. Instead, this mode is focused on giving you a more competitive experiences, the 6 classes are all rebalanced to facilitate skill expression and game knowledge. The more you play, the more stuff you unlock for your class and once you get the hang of its surprisingly fun and way more intricate than you thought at first. Donâ€™t overlook it, it might be really your thing.

Conclusion:

To me a perfect game is one that gets a lot of little things right, but at the same time, its art, and how it makes you feel is more important than examining and criticizing every detail. Space Marine 2 gives you the power fantasy of you being among the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes, something every Warhammer nerd fantasizes about ever since they started painting miniatures or reading/listening to the lore of this amazing universe. You get to go along this personal story of Titus to see something curated and then make your own based on the space marine you decide to make for PVE and PVP. The core gameplay is rock-solid and satisfying, with a lot of inspiration taken from DOOM while keeping its own style from the previous game. Artistically and graphically the game looks exactly like fans would envision the 40K universe alongside the overall sound design being a straight 10. The performance overall is impressive considering how many enemies can appear on screen on top of the orchestra of chaos thatâ€™s happening around you.

This by far is the best 40k game Iâ€™ve played so far and deserves all the praise and occasional criticism its receiving. I think thats because people, particularly 40k fans, care about this game and its future; the developers have created an awesome foundation for years of live service support and seem committed to fixing issues through their transparent feedback system. The game has already succeeded critically and financially, now itâ€™s up to the devs build on it. If they do, and they are going to from the looks of their roadmap and their history as a developer, Iâ€™ll be there playing who knows how many years from now. If they somehow donâ€™t, this game is still an incredible game and is easily worth the 60 you put in.

I recommend it, play it if your PC can run it. Thanks for reading this needlessly long steam review, but at the same time, what is wrong with you? You have wasted approximately 5 minutes not serving the emperor.... The inquisition is heading towards your exact location right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Visually stunning, musically mediocre, audio in general is the worst part of the game.

Every single gameplay aspect has something holding it back:

- Melee (not enough stagger/damage on higher difficulties especially annoying with the hammer),
- Shooting (barely any gun feels powerful and most of them sound weak too, it's just a feeling though damage is ok)

- Executions/Finishers and other animations where you cant control your character do not have enough invulnerability frames so you take lots of damage without any means to avoid it.

In the end it doesn't matter cause you still feel like a Space Marine and some of the missions are breathtakingly beautiful, just not the second coming of Christ that most of people are telling me this game is.

edit:
- 8/10 if you co op this with a friend or two.
- In this review i'm talking only about the campaign, there are co-op, pvp modes i didnt play enough to have an opinion on them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many people and I emphasize this many people in these reviews clearly know nothing of what warhammer 40k is and it shows. This game is incredible for long time fans of the franchise and the combat is well developed with the alerts being more of a be aware as opposed to a perfect parry for larger enemies. if you ask me this is a 10/10 for any long time 40k fans. I am excited to see what saber adds. The people who cant play or launch probably dont have the specs for some considering my friends are able to play on a steam deck. For those who need it THIS IS NOT LIKE HELLDIVERS and others its an actually skill issue, learn the mechanics. Your input times matter deeply its based off the animations not just a ding and push. Listen to some lore videos before you jump in making comments its a very long and deep franchise.

Edit after a month. Opinions unchanged still recommend heavily. Sabre interactive listened to people and Everyday I'm counting down to the next content update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A masterful successor to the original that provides a fantastic 40k experience, I would recommend this to any fan of 40k," whether casual or seriousness. My only complaint is that the later parts of the game tend to be more of a gunner-fest(seriously the amount of ranged DPS that gets thrown your way is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™?insane) that takes away from the amazing melee combat the game offers.""",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

En el momento de realizar esta reseÃ±a llevo acumuladas 13 horas de juego, principalmente en el modo CampaÃ±a y algo del modo Operaciones, y el juego, aunque tiene algunos apartados a mejorar, roza el sobresaliente.

Mi experiencia se basa sobre todo en el modo de dificultad Veterano y jugando con amigos en cooperativo, ya que pienso que esta es la autÃ©ntica y mejor experiencia que el juego ofrece. Superar al extremo una situaciÃ³n que parecÃ­a imposible y que todo tu equipo sienta la euforia de la victoria es una gran experiencia.

El juego es un portento a nivel visual, y al menos para equipos modernos estÃ¡ bien optimizado, permitiendo jugar en modo Calidad con bastante fluidez a la que tengas un equipo decente. La ambientaciÃ³n, el mundo de Warhammer 40K, los seres que lo habitan y la escala de sus conflictos estÃ¡n perfectamente recreados. Es increÃ­ble la cantidad de cosas que llegan a suceder en pantalla sin que el rendimiento se resienta.

Aunque el transcurso del juego sea lineal, los escenarios son bastante amplios, ricos en detalles y tienen bastantes recovecos donde se esconden alijos de armamento, recursos o secretos. Dicho esto, en este caso la linealidad, lejos de ser algo negativo, le sienta perfectamente al juego, ya que la intensidad y la tensiÃ³n del conflicto se perderÃ­an con un mundo mÃ¡s abierto. Tal vez sÃ­ estarÃ­a bien contar con mayor exploraciÃ³n y opciones en la Barcaza, pero es algo que ya estÃ¡ planeado para futuras temporadas.

La personalizaciÃ³n de los personajes de los modos multijugador estÃ¡ bastante bien, aunque echo en falta mÃ¡s variedad de piezas, y sobre todo poder cambiar el rostro del personaje (Â¡Quiero a mi lobo espacial barbudo y pelirojo!), pero confÃ­o en que estas opciones que faltan lleguen con expansiones de contenido.

A nivel jugable ofrece un sistema de combate bastante mÃ¡s profundo de lo que cabrÃ­a esperar en un principio, ya que cuenta con un sistema de combos en el que puedes detonar un ataque potente en cualquier momento, de forma que cuanto mÃ¡s esperes para hacerlo mayor serÃ¡ el riesgo, pero tambiÃ©n el daÃ±o causado a los enemigos. Por ejemplo, si lo detonamos en el primer ataque, daremos una patada, en el segundo un empujÃ³n y en tercero un pisotÃ³n que lanzarÃ¡ a los enemigos por los aires y los aturdirÃ¡.

TambiÃ©n cuenta con un sistema de bloqueos (parry) y esquivas, que bien utilizados nos permitirÃ¡n tambiÃ©n aturdir a los enemigos y acabar con ellos rÃ¡pidamente, para regenerar nuestros escudos, aumentando nuestra capacidad de supervivencia.

En cuanto a las armas a distancia, la sensaciÃ³n a los mandos es buena, aunque bastante similar a lo que ya hemos visto en muchos otros juegos de acciÃ³n. Eso sÃ­, tanto en combate a melee como a distancia, el juego ofrece una enorme variedad de armas, asÃ­ que tendremos que decidir cuÃ¡l utilizar en cada situaciÃ³n o cuÃ¡l se adapta mejor a nuestro estilo de juego.

Por Ãºltimo, en combate cada personaje o clase tiene una habilidad especial Ãºnica que se tiene que cargar antes de ser utilizada, pero que nos permite en muchas ocasiones darle la vuelta a una situaciÃ³n desfavorable.

En nivel Veterano, el juego dista mucho de ser un mata-mata, siendo necesario analizar el entorno, identificar las mejores zonas donde buscar cobertura, o dÃ³nde emboscar a los enemigos, asÃ­ como trazar un plan entre todos los jugadores para optimizar sus esfuerzos.

Como puntos negativos, destacarÃ­a algunos errores puntuales que hacen que nuestro personaje atraviese elementos que no deberÃ­a, algÃºn enemigo que se queda atrapado con algÃºn elemento del escenario, unas animaciones faciales que podrÃ­an ser algo mÃ¡s expresivas y las desconexiones del servidor, que aunque no son algo frecuente, cuando ocurren son bastante molestas. TambiÃ©n hubiese estado bien contar con algo mÃ¡s de variedad de situaciones, ya que a pesar de que cuenta con algunos momentos especiales, otros tantos se repiten demasiado. Y por Ãºltimo, algÃºn menÃº puede llegar a ser confuso al principio.

En resumen, a falta de probar el PVP, y que algunos de los errores comentados se vaya corrigiendo, me parece un juego que todo seguidor del gÃ©nero de acciÃ³n o del mundo de Warhammer 40K deberÃ­a probar, sobre todo en su modo cooperativo, tanto en CampaÃ±a como en Operaciones, ya que es un juego bastante bueno y lo serÃ¡ aÃºn mÃ¡s con las expansiones que estÃ¡n por venir.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am struggling to find anything to complain about. My biggest gripe with this game is that I want more, and I think this is a good problem to have.

Encoutered a few annoyances:
- menuing not being too convinient (mostly, I dislike that it takes two screens to set the difficulty+mission combo in the coop mode - it really really REALLY should be one screen). I'd love to see this polished up.
- the game will queue you into lobbies where someone is already playing your class, forcing you to change your class. I feel like that's a bit meh, since I enjoy playing one class for long sessions.
- very rarely (happened about three times in the 18 hours I've played so far) the game will lock you in place for a few seconds after a finisher animation - you're invincible and it'll recover, but it ruins the momentum, allowing the enemies to move away, which is a slight problem for any melee class.

And that's about it. Everything else is awesome. This feels exactly how I'd imagine a supersoldier smashing through the battlefield. The combat system has this heaviness to it, and your hits matter. I haven't felt this much power in my hands since DOOM - and I'm glad to have a new game in my GOAT steam folder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long awaited sequel lives up to the hype.
As a 40K fan from the books to the games, I am overly pleased and blown away at the game's detail, gameplay and scope.

The gameplay is clearly a step-up from the simplicity of the first game, adding in just the right amount of abilities, combat mechanics and weaponry.

The campaign's story is hype and larger in scope compared to the first game.

The PvE missions which are closely tied to the campaign are impressive and fun (adds to replayability). At some points I was reminded of Destiny's raids in terms of scale and puzzles (just slimmed down). I am very excited to hear that more of these PvE ops will be added for free in the future. Eternal War PvP is short and sweet, along with what feels like a good balance of classes and perks.

The game's linear progression in the campaign and short single-player reminds me of games from a decade ago, matching the first game's length. If you really enjoyed the first one, this is your new best friend.

Technical issues like crashing in loading screens, crashing after mission completes, server drops, and other small bugs are occasional but not extreme.

As a 40K fan, this will be a game I will come back to for a long time. Even non-40K fans will enjoy this 3rd person action shooter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

let me preface this review, it is amazing fun, its beautiful on PC with smooth controls, its campaign is fantastic, a decent amount of customisation rounds it all out, I can see myself able to play this game for many hours.

However, there are some issues, some normal for any games launch as disappointing as they are, some decisions that are just outright stupid until these are fixed even though I love it I cant recommend it.

first and foremost, offline progress is not counted towards your account in operations, now some people have said its an anti cheating measure and I can see that perspective however it pails in comparison to the complete struggle that is trying to play the game in online, as you can expect, like many games of this era online play is wrought with server issues, disconnects mid session, finding it near impossible to get a game going, lag-spikes and jittering all the common symptoms, what this equates too is a game that forces you to play online to progress your account, while being barely able to support online play at all.

this carry's on, if you get disconnected mid session which is very common, you lose all progress, all rewards collected in the mission, you cannot rejoin the game in a standard manner, you cannot carry on the mission with bots in offline mode (even if you could no rewards are likely still an issue.) you get the pure pleasure of being told to go stuff yourself and restart from scratch, one only has so many hours in a day, don't make us waste them.

it is mind blowing to me how one can create a game as beautiful and fun as this and then completely drop the ball at what is completely bloody obvious, the game at launch WILL have server issues, so here's a crack brained idea, maybe don't punish all of your players for the possible action of 1% of players that will cheat in offline mode, in a PVE mission mode if that even was the reasoning behind this decision, its truly mind boggling, Total Biscuit would call it a piece of art with a dumb-ass poking holes in it with a pitchfork, Saber are actively harming players with weak or intermittent internet signals, which makes up a far greater majority, even when the server issues are fixed, which I am sure they are working on.

There are game breaking bugs as well, if you die in some campaign missions on harder difficulties, the ammo boxes disappear, with no spoilers, this makes the mission impossible to progress, not because you cant just chain sword them, but there are enemies and objects you have to shoot, with no ammo to do so.

until bug fixes are done, offline mode grants progression, the servers are fixed, and some truly baffling decisions are reassessed I strongly recommend waiting for the game to go on sale which by then it will hopefully be fixed, or borrow the game and enjoy the best parts about it offline.

you have every part of a great meal here Saber, stop messing it up, you are proactively harming players.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whats my brief summary of Warhammer 40K: Space Marines 2?
Uh...well...
There's Space marines
Loading screens
And buggy cutscenes...

Oh and chainswords....
Mother
F*cking
C H A I N S W O R D S !

In all seriousness yeah its an alright enough game with a short but decent campaign (albeit some aforementioned cutscene errors or bugs such as where they either freeze but the audio continues or its the opposite of the audio lagging behind the visuals of a cutscene).

Combats fun allowing you to pull off some cool as finishers to enemies to regain health and shields (finishing moves in action games is always a win) but some of the controls can feel quite janky with awkward keybinds set by the game for pc.

The operations co-op mode currently has an error where you can get stuck in the hub after readying up for a level and would certainly benefit from some variety, otherwise the same 6 levels could get repetitive for some people, I like to think of it like its Left 4 Dead where you can play through the same levels countless times but the game play is what keeps it fun, but some more random/less linear objectives if possible could probably help make the levels feel less repetitive.
With hopefully some more content and additions operations mode can hopefully reach just a bit more of the potential that it does offer, but still simply just co-op romping with some friends or random allies and curb stomping aliens together are fun solid foundations, hopefully it can just be improved upon.

There's a PVP multiplayer mode where you play as the space marines faction or the Chaos marine (evil hellish marines) faction and fight each other. I haven't played much of it myself but yeah its alright, its there for those who want it.
You can't unfortunately customise the Chaos faction characters, you get premade models for each of the classes on that side, which while they do look cool themselves, does seam like some people are still let down that you can't customise them as well like you can with the space marines.
As far as I've seen theres not many like cool takedowns or anything you can do to enemy players, its just clunky space marines on both sides blasting or thwacking each other clumsily like its a call of duty game and using their ultimate abilities non-stop with no cohesion to see who dies first, then respawning with your abilities charged again to rush back into the fight and repeat the process. Yeah its alright for those who may like the PVP stuff but personally I think the PVE stuff's more the games strong point.

Both the Co-op mode and PVP mode have separate level progressions though so don't think you can level up a class in co-op mode then pop into PVP with a skilled up PVE dude and stomp fools, which is fair BUT however, while class level progression is separate for each mode. You can still unlock cosmetics currency and armour pieces for your characters just by completing matches in both modes as each character. So you can still play both modes and they still count for cosmetic progress at least for each class you beat a match as, so thats nice.

Yeah look, TLDR: Its a decent co-op game and being able to run around and stomp out enemies with allies while playing as giant f*ck off power armoured boys is still awesome. Heck I'm not a big Warhammer series fan myself meaning I knew bugger all about the lore, but I am starting to learn some things about the universe by playing this game and its encouraged me to look a bit more into it.

And you don't need to be a fan of the franchise or know everything to enjoy the game, I'm a simple fella, I saw big mech suits, chainsaws and brutally ripping alien scum to shreads... and thats all I wanted from it.

So its still a solid cool game to play and have fun wreaking havoc on enemies with your big space marine ruthlessness and brutality. But I think it would benefit from some more additions and content, the foundation is there, just build on it and add more levels, and maybe some variety in objectives to keep the co-op mode from becoming stale.

P.S The Season Pass content cosmetics have been a bit disappointing so far, Its just more colours and decals really, I was hoping for more unique/cool and actual standout armour pieces or such to justify its content but so far it leaves alot to be desired IMO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This game has the feel and vibe of a game made in the late 2000s, early 2010s. The way the multiplayer and the PvE modes play wouldn't be out of place in that era, minus the graphics. This isn't as common nowadays, if at all. So in a weird way, it's a refreshing change that I don't hate at all.

The game currently lacks any microtransactions, and apparently there's no concrete plans for modern microtransaction models. You want new cosmetics? Play the game modes. You want new weapons? Play the game modes. This is good. I like this.

The gameplay feels similar to how the first Space Marine did, with significant improvements in some areas, and a few missteps. The biggest issue comes in the form of the difficulty, as some enemies are just obnoxiously too powerful on their own, with the methods that they swarm you making it all the worse to deal with. This really only is an issue I've found with the Tyranids. The moment you get to your second set of enemies, it's nowhere near as bad.

Also what is the point of a heavy bolter if a simple SHIELD can stop it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Story is about 10 hours of gameplay (including doing the side coop missions at least once, that are part of the story, but also the content you grind after) and I enjoyed it for what it was. I think this is a great intro to the 40k universe/lore for people new to it.

The gameplay is fun and with the classes and guns available right now there is enough variation to enjoy and keep playing. Where the game does lack though, is the mission content. The re-playable/grind-able missions I feel will get a bit boring after maybe 20-30 hours of grinding them. There is some variation in spawns (elites/bosses can spawn in certain parts of the mission path) but with the few missions that you can run, it isn't enough. Granted the devs plan to expand this later.

There is a PVP mode that will extend the games life a bit but I am yet to try it, although I think it is probably gonna be quite fun.

The game looks beautiful and runs smooth for me (7950x3d, 4090FE, 64gb 6000mhz ram) with the only issue being - when I try to quit the game, it doesn't actually quit. I have to kill it manually.

Overall, id recommend this but if you are only here for the story - wait for it to be expanded with DLC releases or wait for the game to go on a 50% sale. I also got the ultra edition - don't do this unless you just want to support the game, the content it gives you over the Gold isn't really worth it.

Fantastic. Itâ€™s exactly what you'd expect from a sequel to 2011â€™s Space Marine and a Warhammer 40K action game. It takes everything that made the first game fun and cranks it up, refining pretty much everything that you remember about that original game.

I never followed the details about the story prior to the release so I wasn't sure if it's gonna pick up from where the last game left off. But I was pleased to see that not only does it still feature Captain Titus as the main character, but also manages to be an overall much better story with a couple of fun memberberries thrown in for fans of the original.

And if you're really invested in the lore, you'll be pleased to know that the developers poured a lot of heart and attention into making this an accurate 40K experience. It's probably the most authentic ""play as a Space Marine"" experience to date, because you truly feel like an eight-foot-tall truck on legs, towering over regular humans and barreling through everything like an elephant in a china shop. Including any living thing that isn't at least as big, because it's going to end up getting stomped like a grape. Everything about this game's design is just as over-the-top, excessive, and ludicrous as you'd expect, and it's glorious.

This is in my honest opinion the best Warhammer 40k game we've ever had. It does a lot of things very well, and very little outright bad.

The story is good but nothing mind-bending. There's the usual 40k war drama. A few nice twists, and some truly breath catching moments. All of that is if you're a fan of the setting.

If you're not, or yet undecided, then this is a very good entry point. The game does an amazing job showing the scale of conflicts that take place in the universe. Then it impresses you with its visuals and sound design and does not stop.


Things of note, multiplayer (both PVE and PVP) have customization, and the story clocked for me at around 12 hours at the hardest difficulty. Performance seems good enough, though people mention crashing and CPUs going very hot, so keep that in mind.

And well, that's it. It's a great game. It looks great, it plays great, and it sounds great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have never EVER paid 120 dollars (my currency) for a game and didn't regret it. Worth every penny, every percentage of hype for the past few years since the teasers.

11/10 story, 9/10 Co-op and MP. Some slight flaws but nothing major or game breaking. Just bugs and a little bit of balancing would fix it.

Would definitely never download the heretical Helldivers 2 ever again after this bombshell of a game just dropped. What a time to be alive my fellow brothers

Un gioco meraviglioso!! Da giocare dopo il primo Space Marine per comprendere al meglio la storia.
Appena finito la campagna, Ã¨ stata davvero una grande avventura sotto ogni punto di vista. Avrei voluto fosse un po' piÃ¹ lunga, perÃ² vabbÃ¨.. giocherÃ² Operazioni e PvP.
Molti si lamentano delle espressioni dei personaggi, ma sinceramente fregato un cazzo.. non Ã¨ quello il focus del gioco. Sparare ad orde immense di nemici, sangue ovunque, combattere con i propri fratelli... questo voglio vedere!
Cinematiche veramente allucinanti, grafica spettacolare, le ost anche loro veramente incredibili.
Complessivamente gli do un 9, piÃ¹ che meritato!

Space Marine 2 is easily one of the top games in the Warhammer 40K universe. After 13 long years of waiting since the excellent first game, it was absolutely worth the anticipation. To be completely honest, I got my hands on it early thanks to the leak in July, but since I knew Iâ€™d be buying the full version (and went all out for the maximum edition), I think that excuses my impatience. I simply couldn't wait!

Campaign

The sequelâ€™s story picks up directly from the first game, even though about 200 years have passed in the timeline. The campaign is as grand as youâ€™d hope, fitting perfectly within the Warhammer 40K universe. Blood, gruesome executions, and limb-tearing battles define this world, and the game delivers on all fronts. While itâ€™s linear and heavily focused on combat, I found the whole experience a ton of fun.

Combat Mechanics

The combat truly nails the feeling of being an unstoppable, armored giant. From the moment you start the campaign itâ€™s clear that you are super-human. The Ultramarines stand out from the surroundings and look like some sort of Titans, with their sheer size making them equals to the Tyranid warriors. The weight and power of your weapons â€?both melee and ranged â€?feel spot on, especially when playing with a controller (Iâ€™m using an Xbox one). Each hit, shot, and headshot feels impactful, and those bloody finishing moves? Just perfect.

Co-op Mode

A great addition is the new co-op mode. After the introductory mission, you can jump into the campaign with one or two friends, and it works flawlessly. It really amps up the excitement of playing together. If you're playing solo, the AI companions are excellent, so you wonâ€™t feel left out.

Multiplayer

And now for the real treat: multiplayer. If you have fond memories of the multiplayer from the original Space Marine, youâ€™re in for a treat. It was brilliant back then and kept me entertained for hours. Now, after 13 years, we finally have what weâ€™ve been waiting for. The multiplayer alone makes Space Marine 2 worth buying. If you're into the Warhammer 40K universe, thereâ€™s no better PvP experience out there.

In my opinion, itâ€™s a solid 10/10. Definitely worth checking out!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After playing the PvE / PVP and finishing the campaign I must say this game feels like a blast from the past.
Throughout the story I felt like I was a teenager again, its weird to explain. I felt like I did back when the original gears of war or halo games came out, nostalgic almost. Haven't had a game give me that feeling in a long time.

What an absolute joy it is to slaughter xenos filth in the name of The Emperor while repping the Salamander Green.

Does seem a bit performance heavy, so maybe some optimizations will be on their way soon enough. No real impact on my experience as I'm running a bit of an overpriced rig however because of that I always run a frame rate counter and monitor temps out of obsession.

Highly recommending this to anyone that loves the Space Marines foremost, and Warhammer 40ks beautiful cast of characters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Speaking as a person who has invested far more money into tabletop warhammer than I care to consider, who has read dozens of black library books this game is the best representation of 40k I've ever seen outside of writing. There is so much love and attention to detail in this game that it could truly have only been made by people who are enormous fans of the setting. I don't want to spoil things before the game is even fully out but let me say the scene with the chapter banner was AMAZING and it might not have even been the coolest moment in the game. I constantly felt like I was seeing the stories and miniatures I know so well brought to life, it was a really remarkable thing.

The performance is also like, weirdly good? I only have a 3700x // RX 7800XT and it ran flawlessly all the way through the campaign at 1440P, on Linux no less. It's pretty remarkable. Really feels like the time they spent during the delay was very well spent indeed.

If you care about warhammer 40k literally at all I cannot recommend this game strongly enough. Even if you don't I'd say it stands quite well on its own merit as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AprÃ¨s avoir passÃ© plus de 16 h sur le jeu, je pense avoir un avis sur le jeu assez bon, mÃªme sâ€™il reste quelques problÃ¨mes qui, je lâ€™espÃ¨re, seront rÃ©glÃ©s Ã  la sortie ou peut-Ãªtre via dâ€™autres patchs.

Pour les points positifs : 

â€?Le gunplay est vraiment satisfaisant : par moment, on a vraiment l'impression d'Ãªtre invincible jusqu'au moment oÃ¹ l'on tombe sur des mobs d'Ã©lite, oÃ¹ l'on doit quasiment envoyer 1 voire 2 chargeurs pour les tuer (ce qui est relativement handicapant quand eu en 5 balles nous met 1/4 life !). Mise Ã  part Ã§a contre les petits mobs ou mÃªme les boss, on voit vraiment une utilitÃ© Ã  spammer avec son bolter.

â€?Ensuite, pour ce qui est de l'ambiance, musique, environnement, tout y est, c'est un rÃ©el plaisir en tant que fan de la licence de voir un jeu aussi bien fait.

â€?Une campagne super sympa Ã  faire seul ou avec des amis ! (ce qui serait cool, mais surement impossible Ã  faire, serait de rajouter des campagnes de chaque chapitre/lÃ©gion mise Ã  l'honneur, comme par exemple pour les Dark Angels qui vont Ãªtre mis Ã  l'honneur courant cette annÃ©e, mais je rÃªve un peu trop).

Maintenant, on va passer au point MID, ce qui est bon, mais qui reste Ã  amÃ©liorer : 

â€?Le systÃ¨me de customisation et de classe ! Alors, pour le coup, je m'attendais Ã  quelque chose de fou quand finalement, je me retrouve devant une customisation assez limitÃ©e au dÃ©but oÃ¹ l'on doit payer avec la monnaie du jeu (que l'on dÃ©bloque en jouant, pas de soucis Ã  se faire sur ce point-lÃ ), mais j'ose imaginer que sur le long terme, la customisation sera incroyable (petite pensÃ©e aux fans de Space Marine du chaos qui jetaient leurs larmes pour pleurer sur leur customisation ultraâ€?Les serveurs/classes, je vais les mettre au mÃªme niveau parce que les deux sont relativement liÃ©s ! ET OUI comme dit dans les bande annonce il y a bien 6 classes mais sur les 6 il n'y en a que facilement 2/3 qui sont jouable sinon le reste poubelle ou presque et surtout comme je l'ai dis les serveurs sont de la partie donc ils suffit qu'il y ai 2 personnes qui veulent jouer la mÃªme classe en OpÃ©ration et la partie ne peut pas se lancer et donc une grande partie des serveurs sont sois bloquer car les 2 classes les plus jouable sont prise mais j'ai bonne espoir que Ã§a sera corriger avant la sortie du jeu 

â€?Un jeu (pour le moment trÃ¨s important Ã  souligner), pour le moment assez rÃ©pÃ©titif, c'est-Ã -dire que vous avez 6 missions avec les mÃªmes objectifs Ã  chaque fois, de temps en temps des boss qui se rajouteraient, mais pas de quoi casser 3 pattes Ã  un canard. (AprÃ¨s, c'est une avant-premiÃ¨re pour le moment, la road map est dÃ©jÃ  sortie et il y a 4 saisons dÃ©jÃ  prÃ©vues, donc que de bon pour le moment, y'a juste Ã  espÃ©rer que les chiffres ne casse pas la dynamique, car pour le moment oÃ¹ j'Ã©cris ce texte, le jeu est trÃ¨s minimaliste).
Et maintenant les points nÃ©gatifs Ã  amÃ©liorer au plus vite, pitiÃ©.

â€?Le corps Ã  corps ! alors trÃ¨s stylÃ© le systÃ¨me de contre y'a pas a dire mais quand il y a une dizaine dâ€™ennemie qui vous tire dessus et vous frappe disons que c'est assez compliquer de le faire ensuite truc assez bÃªte mais imaginer attaquer un mob Ã©lite au corps a corps vous lui mettez 1-2 coups vous charger la troisiÃ¨me il vous envois une attaque qui vous stune et votre combo et complÃ¨tement stopper sans que vous puissiez rien faire tout en sachant qu'il y a surement 2/3 ennemie autour de vous entrain de vous arracher le gosier d'une puissance jamais vu et la rentre en jeu l'une des deux classe jouable la classe rempart une classe avec un simple pistolet une arme au corps a corps et le saint bouclier qui augmente votre chance de survivre a ce carnage au contact de 10% Ã  un solide 50% (je parle de la game entiÃ¨re Ã©videment) et oui dans se jeu malheureusement il n'y a pas de systÃ¨me de dÃ©fense simple des esquive ou bien le contre sinon vous subissez et vous pleurez en silence puis sans parler sur systÃ¨me d'attaque en gÃ©nÃ©rale qui lock absolument tout et n'importe quoi il y a un systeme de lock pour combattre comme il se doit un ennemie au corps a corps mais comme je l'ai dit en rÃ¨gle gÃ©nÃ©rale c'est pas du 1vs1 c'est du 15vs1 donc oubliez les assez vite sauf si vous jouez en pvp la il vous sera peut-Ãªtre plus utile 

-Enfin pour moi le pire du pire c'est la vie elle disparaÃ®t si facilement c'est trÃ¨s trÃ¨s grave comme je l'ai dit plus haut vous allez tomber sur des mob Ã©lite qui en rÃ¨gle gÃ©nÃ©rale tank pas mal donc vous avez plusieurs option soit vous leurs foncez dessus et vous passez la moitiez de la game sans vie soit vous leurs tirez dessus et vous vous armez de patience et vous  envoyez 2 chargeur se 1 seul mob vont aussi vous allumer en moins d'un chargeur (L'avantage de cette option ce qu'il y a des munition tout les 5 mÃ¨tres c'est a se demander comment elle se retrouve la par moment) alors que le heal et une prÃ©cieuse ressource que vous trouverais aprÃ¨s avoirs fini votre opÃ©ration surement c'est tellement rare a trouver que si vous en avez allez jouez au loto vous avez vos chance ! il y a bien un bouclier mais honnÃªtement c'est juste visuel c'est juste pour dire regarder y'a un bouclier qui est complÃ©ment inutile donc j'attend pas a avoir des ennemi plus nul non j'attend d'avoir un systÃ¨me de protection parce que quand au corps a corps c'est une orgie tous sur moi avec absolument 0 dÃ©fense juste une belle Ã©pÃ©e tronÃ§onneuse qui 2 shoot des petit mob alors imaginer mon Ã©tat aprÃ¨s avoir affronter 3 mobs Ã©lites au corps a corps ! Ce qui est dommage, honnÃªtement, on joue des space marines et je me retrouve Ã  hÃ©siter Ã  affronter 3/4 ploucs qui vont surement tank comme des porcs, donc je ne sais pas : soit il faudrait rendre utile le bouclier, ce qui serait bien, soit peut-Ãªtre augmenter notre rÃ©sistance ou soit mettre plus de heal, parce que lÃ , j'ai l'impression de jouer au petit chaperon rouge et je ne suis pas du tout le grand mÃ©chant loup.

Bref Beaucoup dâ€™attente sur la suite des choses, en espÃ©rant que Ã§a continue pour le mieux et surtout que le jeu fasse une bonne arrivÃ©e pour que le monde du jeu vidÃ©o sâ€™intÃ©resse beaucoup plus au lore de Warhammer 40k !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering I played the game on an ultra-wide monitor and looked horrendous as a result.

This game was fantastic!

The campaign is a gem!

Story writing, the CINEMATICS, a few secret surprises here and there.
Just off the campaign alone I would seriously recommend this game.

I just built a new computer 2 weeks ago.
Ryzen 7 7800X3D
GeForce RTX 4080 Super
64GB DDR5 RAM

The game has crashed 3 times so far, each time causing my entire computer to crash. I've adjusted the settings each time in hopes of avoiding another crash.

One friend had his GPU suddenly start failing/showing artifacts. Another friend has high temp CPU. This is the 'only' game this has happened on.

Oh, and scrubbing the ""play PvP with up to 5 friends in 6v6 matches"" and capping a party to 3 people is a very low blow.

Definitely needs some fixing as far as performance goes. Until then, thumbs down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having a blast, main game campaign whoever was responsible with the lore part got it pretty well and the last boss was really fun with my friends in the Angels of Death difficulty. Now I'm playing Ops with them and let me tell you, its another campaign with its own story. Stuff that happen while Titus takes care of the main course so to say. I really recommend checking it.

My only minor complaint, PvP chaos marines not being able to customize their stuff. And Salamanders when you pick their customization the Adeptus Astartes not getting obsidian skin and red eyes. Devs please include it when you pick the Salamanders chapter I presume it shouldn't be hard to implement such thing.

Performance wise it was all right for me I think I just presence 5-6 stutters during my whole gameplay in the campaign and it seems its something related with the green effect from the Tyranids that cause it but I can't pinpoint if is the spores or the psychic effect , my current specs:

Multiplayer is unplayable for me and many others. Can't join friends, getting stuck on loading screens that say ""Joining Server"". Cant join multiplayer matches for the same reason. Devs aren't being helpful or communicative. Will keep this negative until they fix that issue, then I'll post a proper review.

Update: The game has launched officially and there's a massive spike in people reporting the same issue. The devs have made vague references to maybe hotfixing the issue, but nothing concrete.

Roleplaying game, gameplay very average, dont buy now, wait for a year at least.

Very bad servers, EXTREMELY long loading screens, PVP has 3 Maps with the most shallow design possible, no Ranked System or leader board or any Private lobbies, cant choose server location, constant disconnection. Some load out systems legit have 2 options only for PVP, and the second option is locked behind 20+ hours of grind. MUST MUTE ANNOUNCER IN PVP, the voice lines loop every time someone goes on the objectives.

Ai teammates are completely useless if you play solo, combat system tries to replicate Vermintide and Darktide but fails, The grey health restoration mechanic is minimal and the shields are obsolete as they get deleted in 1 hit. Higher difficulties are unbalanced because of the power scaling of your character, the upgrades are disappointing and lackluster, 5% melee dmg when mobs HP doubles does â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™? No attachments for your gear, Perks have no choices, just linear upgrades with some special nodes.

PVE Operative mode is good tho if you have people to play with, Quick match is too slow and drops you into dead matches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

shut the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up about wider screen resolution, u are a small group compared to the larger pie, this game is easily game of the year just going off on the campaign alone. the co-op crossplay is stable and as of writing this i have yet to play the eternal war mode but i am very excited to do so after having beaten the campaign. i myself had a rocky start launching this game, many attempts at tinkering with options to get past the first intro cutscene but i came in to this game with tempered expectations, and after overcoming this small obstacle, discovered the true glory this game has to offer.

my only critique is that the loading screens can sometimes detract from the immersive gameplay, and often times at least in my case take a fair bit of time. other than that this game is the peak that mankind has been reaching for since the OG space marine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BrÃ¼der und Schwestern des Imperiums, heute betrachten wir ein Werk, das nicht nur ein Spiel, sondern ein Schlachtfeld der Ehre und des Blutes im Dienst des Imperators ist. Space Marine 2 fÃ¼hrt uns erneut in die dÃ¼stere Zukunft des 41. Jahrtausends, wo es nur Krieg gibt â€?und es macht dies mit solcher Wucht, dass selbst die hÃ¤rtesten Krieger ehrfÃ¼rchtig zurÃ¼ckweichen kÃ¶nnten.


- Handlung und AtmosphÃ¤re â€?Der ewige Krieg ruft!

Space Marine 2 setzt die Geschichte des Ultramarines Captain Titus fort, dessen unerschÃ¼tterliche LoyalitÃ¤t gegenÃ¼ber dem Imperator und der Menschheit im Mittelpunkt steht. Hier zeigt sich die tiefe Verbindung zur dÃ¼steren und brutalen Lore des Warhammer 40k-Universums. Die AtmosphÃ¤re ist durchzogen von Verzweiflung und Heldenmut. Jeder Schritt auf den Schlachtfeldern â€?ob auf verseuchten Planeten oder in den schmutzigen StraÃŸen imperialer StÃ¤dte â€?schreit nach dem Schrecken des 41. Jahrtausends. Die Bedrohung durch die Tyraniden ist allgegenwÃ¤rtig, und die Darstellung dieser xenosrischen AlbtrÃ¤ume ist wahrlich furchterregend. Ihre Horden wogen wie eine lebendige Flut Ã¼ber die Stellungen der Verteidiger hinweg, und das Spiel fÃ¤ngt die schiere Masse und Grausamkeit dieser Kreaturen meisterhaft ein.

Die Geschichte selbst entfaltet sich als epischer Kampf um das Ãœberleben der Menschheit. Captain Titus, geschmiedet im Feuer zahlloser Schlachten, muss nicht nur gegen Ã¤uÃŸere Feinde kÃ¤mpfen, sondern auch gegen innere Zweifel. Die Frage, was es wirklich bedeutet, ein Space Marine zu sein â€?eine unaufhaltsame TÃ¶tungsmaschine oder der letzte Verteidiger der Menschheit â€? wird immer wieder aufgegriffen. Doch wer Captain Titus kennt, weiÃŸ, dass seine Treue unerschÃ¼tterlich bleibt, und dies macht ihn zu einem wahrhaft legendÃ¤ren Charakter.


- Gameplay â€?Der Donner des Bolters und das Heulen der Kettenschwerter

Das Gameplay von Space Marine 2 ist wie ein donnernder Hymnus an den Krieg. Das Spiel fÃ¤ngt die Essenz eines Space Marines perfekt ein: Du bist kein gewÃ¶hnlicher Soldat â€?du bist ein wandelnder Panzer, eine lebendige Waffe des Imperators, gemacht um Tausende von Feinden zu vernichten. Das GefÃ¼hl der Macht, wenn man den Abzug eines Bolters drÃ¼ckt und sieht, wie Feinde in Blut und Fleisch explodieren, ist unÃ¼bertroffen.

Das Nahkampfsystem ist eine brutale Symphonie aus Klingen und FÃ¤usten. Die Kettenschwerter brÃ¼llen und sÃ¤gen sich durch die Reihen der Feinde, wÃ¤hrend die SchlÃ¤ge eines Energiehammers Wellen der ZerstÃ¶rung durch ganze Formationen senden. Jeder Treffer, jeder Schlag fÃ¼hlt sich mÃ¤chtig an, und die audiovisuelle Umsetzung unterstreicht dies perfekt â€?von den metallischen KlÃ¤ngen der ServorÃ¼stung bis hin zu den knirschenden Knochen und reiÃŸenden Sehnen der Feinde.

Neu hinzugefÃ¼gt wurde eine verfeinerte Mechanik fÃ¼r AusweichmanÃ¶ver und taktisches Vorankommen. Dies verleiht den KÃ¤mpfen eine zusÃ¤tzliche strategische Ebene, ohne den Fluss des BlutvergieÃŸens zu unterbrechen. Besonders beeindruckend ist die Art, wie das Spiel die Zahl der Gegner handhabt â€?riesige SchwÃ¤rme von Tyraniden, die auf dich zustÃ¼rmen, und du allein, ein wandelnder Gott des Krieges, der sie niedermetzelt. Es ist eine brutale, kathartische Erfahrung, die jeden Warhammer-Fan begeistern wird.


- Grafik und Sound â€?Ein audiovisuelles Meisterwerk

Die Welt von Warhammer 40k wird in Space Marine 2 mit unglaublicher Detailtreue zum Leben erweckt. Die zerklÃ¼fteten Schlachtfelder, die gottlosen Alienarchitekturen und die prÃ¤chtigen RÃ¼stungen der Space Marines â€?all dies erstrahlt in glorreicher, blutiger Pracht. Besonders hervorzuheben ist die Gestaltung der Tyraniden. Jedes Glied, jede Kralle und jeder zahnbewehrte Schlund dieser abscheulichen Kreaturen wurde mit Liebe zum Detail geschaffen und wirkt wahrhaft furchteinflÃ¶ÃŸend.

Der Soundtrack begleitet die KÃ¤mpfe mit dÃ¼steren, epischen KlÃ¤ngen, die dem Spieler das GefÃ¼hl geben, Teil eines gewaltigen Kreuzzugs zu sein. Die GerÃ¤usche des Schlachtfelds â€?das Rattern der Bolter, das metallische BrÃ¼llen der RÃ¼stungen und das markerschÃ¼tternde Heulen der Tyraniden â€?sind so intensiv, dass man fast den SchweiÃŸ und das Blut riechen kann.


- Fazit â€?Im Namen des Imperators, es gibt keinen Vergleich

Space Marine 2 ist nicht nur ein Spiel, sondern eine Erfahrung. Es fÃ¤ngt die Essenz dessen ein, was es bedeutet, ein Space Marine zu sein: ein Krieger, der in einem Universum voller Tod und Chaos kÃ¤mpft und niemals zurÃ¼ckweicht. Die Mischung aus intensiven, brutalen KÃ¤mpfen, der dÃ¼steren, tiefgrÃ¼ndigen Geschichte und der atemberaubenden audiovisuellen PrÃ¤sentation macht es zu einem Muss fÃ¼r jeden Fan des Warhammer 40k-Universums â€?und fÃ¼r jeden, der den Imperator ehren will.

Dieses Spiel ist ein Monument des Krieges, errichtet auf dem Blut und den Knochen der Feinde des Imperators.

FÃ¼r den Imperator! FÃ¼r das Imperium! Kein Bedauern, kein RÃ¼ckzug, nur Sieg!

9/10 â€?Die Schlacht tobt weiter, und Space Marine 2 ist das Schwert des Imperators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oyunu genel olarak Ã§ok beÄŸendim ancak ÅŸikayetimin olduÄŸu bir kaÃ§ nokta var. Birincisi, oyunun yakÄ±n dÃ¶vÃ¼ÅŸ mekaniklerini iyi yaptÄ±klarÄ± iÃ§in sÃ¼rekli yakÄ±n dÃ¶vÃ¼ÅŸe girmenize zorlanmanÄ±z. Ne alaka diyebilirsiniz ÅŸÃ¶yle aÃ§Ä±klayayÄ±m. CanÄ±nÄ±zÄ±n Ã§ok az kaldÄ±ÄŸÄ± ve merminizin de neredeyse bittiÄŸi bir an dÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼nÃ¼n, karÅŸÄ±nÄ±zda daha sÃ¼rÃ¼yle dÃ¼ÅŸman var. KoÅŸarak biraz mesafe aÃ§mak istiyorsunuz ama yapamÄ±yorsunuz. Ã‡Ã¼nkÃ¼ yaratÄ±klar sizden Ã§ok daha hÄ±zlÄ± ve aralÄ±ksÄ±z olarak spamlarcasÄ±na Ã¼stÃ¼nÃ¼ze zÄ±plÄ±yorlar. Siz de isteseniz de istemeseniz de yakÄ±n dÃ¶vÃ¼ÅŸe girmek zorunda kalÄ±yorsunuz Ã§Ã¼nkÃ¼ koÅŸarak kaÃ§maya Ã§alÄ±ÅŸÄ±rsanÄ±z %100 Ã¶leceksiniz. BÃ¶yle sÃ¼rÃ¼yle yaratÄ±k Ã¶ldÃ¼rdÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼nÃ¼z bir oyunda dÃ¼ÅŸmanla birazcÄ±k mesafemi aÃ§Ä±p sonra geri dÃ¶nÃ¼p tekrardan taramaya baÅŸlamak istiyorum ve bunu yapamÄ±yorum. Tamam bir saf shooter oyununa gÃ¶re inanÄ±lmaz derinlikli bir yakÄ±n dÃ¶vÃ¼ÅŸ mekaniÄŸiniz var ama kullanmak da zorunda deÄŸilim. Zaten farklÄ± tarzlarda oynansÄ±n diye 6 farklÄ± class koymuÅŸsunuz. BÄ±rakÄ±n isteyen uzaktan sÄ±ksÄ±n isteyen yakÄ±ndan girsin. Bu uzaktan bakÄ±nca saÃ§ma bir ÅŸikayet gibi gÃ¶rÃ¼nebilir ancak oyunu normal zorluÄŸun Ã¼stÃ¼ne alÄ±p, iletiÅŸim kurduÄŸunuz bir arkadaÅŸÄ±nÄ±z olmadan oynadÄ±ÄŸÄ±nÄ±z zaman dediÄŸimi Ã§ok net bir ÅŸekilde anlayacaksÄ±nÄ±z. BazÄ± noktalar gerÃ§ekten hayatta kalmak imkansÄ±z hale geliyor Ã§Ã¼nkÃ¼ ve oyunun tadÄ± kaÃ§Ä±yor.

Ä°kinci ÅŸikayetim de tamamen Ã§Ä±kmÄ±ÅŸ bir oyuna gÃ¶re az iÃ§erik olmasÄ±. Bu oyunda ana hikaye dÄ±ÅŸÄ±nda online olarak oynayacaÄŸÄ±nÄ±z gÃ¶revler ve bir sÃ¼rÃ¼ geliÅŸtirme imkanÄ± olan 6 farklÄ± class, Ã¼stÃ¼ne her silahÄ±n kendi geliÅŸtirmesi var. Ancak oyunda sadece 6 gÃ¶rev var. Evet 6. Ve hiÃ§biri de o kadar da uzun deÄŸil. Ä°leride illaki gÃ¶rev eklenecektir ama yine de baÅŸlangÄ±Ã§ iÃ§in Ã§ok az. Bu bir erken eriÅŸim oyunu olsa anlarÄ±m ama ÅŸu anda pek anlayabildiÄŸim bir durum deÄŸil bu. Karakter geliÅŸtirmek falan da o kadar Ã§abuk yapabileceÄŸiniz bir ÅŸey deÄŸil. Bir classÄ± fullemek baya zaman alÄ±cak gibi duruyo oynadÄ±ÄŸÄ±m kadarÄ±yla. O yÃ¼zden acilen yeni gÃ¶revler eklenmesi lazÄ±m. AyrÄ±ca silah Ã§eÅŸitliliÄŸi de az ve hali hazÄ±rda bulunan silahlarÄ±n bazÄ±larÄ± birbirine Ã§ok benziyor. Mesela bir silahÄ±n normal, dÃ¼rbÃ¼nlÃ¼ veya altÄ±nda bomba atar olan versiyonu var. Bunlar 3 silah olarak ayrÄ±lmÄ±ÅŸ. Biraz Ã§akallÄ±k gibi geldi ama neyse ileride umarÄ±m Ã§eÅŸitlenir oyun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uno dei titoli che aspettavo da almeno 10 anni, dopo il primo capitolo. E questo secondo capitolo Ã¨ riuscito ad essere molto piÃ¹ entusiasmante di come me l'aspettavo. Partendo dall'ottimizzazione del gioco, e dal feeling delle armi e delle armature degli Space Marines, ma anche le ambientazioni e le spettacolari colonne sonore che accompagnano il tutto",en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rise, Son of Guilliman

After finishing the campaign I just had to write a review to get my thoughts down on paper, this review will contain no spoilers for the story, but will talk about themes, gameplay and performance. Together of course with an overall impression, to start things off.

Space Marine 2 exceeded my expectations by a significant margin, this game is fun to play. I've seen some other reviews talking about how the combat system is ""unforgiving"", but I can only say that I disagree. The fast paces melee / ranged blend is really satisfying once you figure out what works for you. I played the game on the second to highest difficulty for my first run so far, I had to adjust in the beginning but once I got over the hurdle, quite frankly I just saw myself improving and getting better at managing the fights. To an extent fights in this game feel reminiscent of those from DOOM, specifically Eternal. Every fight is a puzzle that you need to think creatively to solve together with staying on top of incoming attacks and positioning.

Complaints about the AI are valid, but I didn't notice much in terms of them getting in the way of me having fun.

Performance wise, I'm running on a fairly old rig, 1080 and an i7-4790k, and I got stable performance albeit not exceptional on the high preset. For me I am fine if a game runs at 30 as long as it is stable, and Space Marine 2 was, depending on level, either running at stable 30, stable 45, stable 60 or unstable 20-30. The 20-30 range being in some of the later where the game is flexing it's muscle in terms of scale and the number of effects on screen.

As for all the stuff with the Epic integration? Quite literally you accept the EULA and that's it. It has no other impact on your gameplay. I find complaints around this sort of stuff to be valid, if exaggerated. It is okay to be upset that this is ""forced"" upon you, but I do not think it warrants leaving a negative review for the game, personally.

Story? This feels like it could've been a 40k novel. I say that with significant praise, compared to the first game the stakes are higher, the characters are better, and it just feels like a part of actual canon now.

I am incredibly satisfied, and depending on how the game develops in the next few years, it might take the spot for ""My personal favorite 40k game"", as it is now, however? Firmly top 3.

Suffice to say, I strongly recommend this game, I will be diving into the multiplayer and co-op components in the next few days, and if there is anything to add or detract from this review, expect addenda :)

If no addenda are found on this review, my stance holds firm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HacÃ­a aÃ±os que no me metÃ­a el vicio que me acabo de meter, pero lo he terminado en el mismo dÃ­a y he disfrutado cada jdo segundo, es la esencia del SM1 refinada en sus puntos fuertes y multiplicandolo todo epicamente dando un producto sobresaliente

El apartado grÃ¡fico es de 10 solido, todo cargado de detalles, efectos y una iluminaciÃ³n magnifica, el curro que tiene detrÃ¡s es espectacular.
Sonido perfecto, acorde con lo que podrÃ­as escuchar en cualquiera de las pelÃ­culas de WH40K, es decir, temas ominosos y Ã©picos todo ello acompaÃ±ado con una gran calidad de sonido de efectos como disparos, enemigos y explosiones.
Quiero destacar el doblaje, tiene 1 Ãºnico detalle que no me entusiasmÃ³, por algun motivo dicen ""imperium"" en vez de imperio, no es un gran trauma, pero me pareciÃ³ raro, pero por lo demÃ¡s muy buena calidad de voces y algo muy chulo, es que puedes cambiar a cualquier idioma disponible en el acto, sin pantallas de carga, lo que te permite, por ejemplo, jugar un rato escuchando el juego en Japones y volver al inicial enseguida.
La historia a la altura del Space Marine 1 pero x4, con buenos personajes y grandes momentos, no busca plantearte nada trascencental, solo que disfrutes del viaje, jugar al 1 es necesario, pero no obligatorio, ya que los detalles que se nombran te los explican durante la historia.
Temas de rendimiento, el caso es que mi poco aÃ±ejo portatil se lo ha soleado, por lo que 0 problemas, pero seguramente darÃ¡ algun que otro quebradero de cabeza en equipos mÃ¡s modestos porque ya solo con la cantidad de partÃ­culas que tiene tendrÃ¡s que ser honesto con la cfg por mÃ¡s que duela.
Y alguna cosa mÃ¡s que se me ocurrirÃ¡ cuando descanse un poco jeje. En resumen, Si te gusta WH40K, este juego es lo que necesitabas aunque no lo supieras ;)

PD: Para los que compraron el juego para ir directos al multi, que he ledio a gente puntuando negativo por ello, necesitan que les ilumine la luz del emperador, de verdad, no se que hacen jugando el multi antes que la campaÃ±a.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Product received for free

With Space Marine II, Saber interactive proves, once again, that they know how to do action games, this time adding a ton of Co-op & PvP options powered by their squeaky-clean net code. The game runs excellently, looking great and performing to specification. I was able to stream it from the same rig I was playing on, and only got one random crash during my five-hour session. Visuals are great, audio is fantastic, and the writing found here is far better than any game in the genre usually gets. The Swarm Engine that made WWZ what it is comes into play and provides a breathtaking sense of scale to most encounters. The price-tag might be a bit steep, at least when we are talking about the Early Access Versions, but they come packed with the first Season Pass, which will eventually make the investment worth it. If you are looking for a really well-crafted action games to play with your friends, will not disappoint. To War!

I paid $90 bucks for this?...

You bet your sweet ass I did. I cannot express what an amazing experience this was as a 40K fan, I haven't touched anything except the story, just finished it in fact, and I was completely blown away. The scale of the set pieces, fan service galore, and all of the Tyranids and Chaos Servants you can ea- um, annihilate, I can feel the love that the devs put into this masterpiece coming inside me.

If you're a fan of 40K, and you liked the original Space Marine game, or you like hack and slash 3PS games, you need to pick this up. This was a labor of love that we may never see again if these f*cking morons leaving negative reviews have their way.

Some sound mixing issues, very few physics based glitches, and absolutely fantastic performance with TWO, COUNT EM TWO hitches in the framerate in my entire playthrough due to I'm guessing shader compilations. This is the most polished game I played in 2024.

Anyone leaving negative reviews for this game because of the Epic stuff? You're a pathetic POS. You will never be able to use Epic Games anything without accepting their TOS, so how the ever living F*CK are you going to sue them? You're apparently not using their products anyways, troglodytes.

Epic already has your data, you're on Steam, just shut up. Parroting worthless BS you don't understand is painful to read, if you had anything worth hiding you wouldn't be leaving a whiny review with less than an hour of game play, you're not helping anyone, and I am coming to your house to sleep with both of your parents while you cry in their basement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, this is my first review.
I'll say right away that the game is quite good, no, even excellent. A worthy continuation of the first Space Marine.
And I want to give credit to Relic Entertainment, because this studio ""laid the foundation"" of the series.
I also want to thank the Saber Interactive studio for a ""quality"" product. And a pretty good plot (although honestly it is short compared to the first part (purely my opinion)).
The combat system is quite dynamic (even very much, I want a little ""old"")
The environment is generally the bomb, you feel the ""scope and epicness""
I'll give the game 8.5 out of 10 (Titus does not ""read out the thought of the day"", you need to get used to the dynamics of the battle)
And the last thing I ask, no, I beg that Saber Interactive make a remaster of the first Space Marine!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game has immersive and astonishing visuals and gets really the wonder of the Warhammer 40k universe grandeur and epic proportions. This can definitely give some inspiration and feel of ave to anyone really interested in the 40k universe.

The gameplay is quite a copy from Warhammer 40k Darktide, in all aspects of level design, weapon design, visuals. Unfortunately this also mean the gameplay, weapons design and level design and enemies are as they were in Darktide. This game however is not some aspiring storm trooper learning to survive, but this is a game where the player is put into the boots of a Space Marine, as super soldier with genetic and technological superiority, an Emperor's angel that alone can take tides of baddies etc.

The problems are soon too apparent and disturb severely the feel given to the player. Weapons have extreme recoil, they have too low damage and too low range and in many cases even too low ammo capacity. You get the feel of being scared, alone, restricted... Not the feeling of being the best there is going with brave heart towards what might look as if being suicidal odds and still expect to come out as unscratched and victorious. The devs should at least to a minimum add the target enhancing and dark vision to be constant things for the Space Marines, not some random and seldom few second bonuses. Also while at it the recoil should mostly go away as the guys here do have the power armour of the best sort and the usual recoil from heavy weapons is nothing to these guys. More over the also have Auspex inbuilt to their helmets, super senses, dark vision, automatic sensor arrays around them etc. This should give them really good combat awareness at all times and extreme accuracy with any weapons. The weapons are also needing to get some sort of a update... It feels so sad to fire a large caliber bolter at some hormagaunt to only see that it fights on and did not even lose a limb or so, and this happens with EVERY round... It get so annoyingly sad too soon... For some reason they also chose not to copy the sound from Darktide, and bolters, chain swords, power swords etc. all sound so lame (which unfortunaly is also lame in effects too)... These Space Marines should be able to kill things with far more less effort than the game makes you do especially if trying anything but the Easy mode. Also the Space Marine power armour is merely more resilient than the health and life points in Darktide making the player die and suffer in situations that are barely seeming dangerous.

Please devs, make the above fixes to the gameplay and also add much more damage to every marine weapon and especially the Heavy Bolter, Plasma Pistol, Plasma Gun, and Meltagun all need to feel like they are some weapons of mass destruction even against bosses. Just allow us feel like god-like super soldiers and not some decent elite commando guys... Make the armour withstand things much more... Currently the tolerance is just pathetic... And while at it, get rid of the dodge roll animation finally... Just allow the super soldier to take a quick leap of some two meters or so worth... The super quick dodge roll in a 300kg armour just really is like a bad bad thing for the immersion. Movent which btw is otherwise very nicely done to give the character some very heavy feel otherwise with all the noises and thumps and slight slowness. It would also be nice if you devs could get some effects where the enemies lose limbs and weapons while being shot at and losing capability to attack or move along. This way you can still allow the enemies to withstand occasionally some bolt or two extra. MAybe also make the enemies have some weak points where they are wounded heavily with shots instead of just being hp reduction thing for them. Though the melee blocking and execution shots are very nice.

The game has been developed as being another Darktide with different skin and seems like the devs wanted the main game to be the multiplayer deathmatch / team match thing instead of the campaign where you go against tyranids... If wanting to get a feel of being a Space Marine among a tyranid invasion, this is not so much of a giving the feeling, but just baing visually very immersive 40k thingy then,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mucho drama por el hecho de que ocupes aceptar los tÃ©rminos de Epic, la mayorÃ­a de las reseÃ±as negativas es por eso, la gente de verdad cree que les importa a las compaÃ±Ã­as la informaciÃ³n de nosotros los viciados a los videojuegos.
Dicho eso, el juego se ve hermoso y hasta el punto en el que voy en la historia, me esta gustando bastante, lo recomiendo mucho, no he probado el multijugador de operaciones ni el JcJ.
El Ãºnico punto malo que le veo es que la IA es un poco inÃºtil cuando se trata de objetivos tÃ¡cticos.
De todas maneras 10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Una obra sÃ³lo digna del mismÃ­simo Emperador, la secuela que todo fan del universo W40K se merecÃ­a. Por ahora una absoluta pasada, en compaÃ±Ã­a se hace una experiencia brutal. Tema rendimiento me ha sorprendido para bien. Deseando terminar la campaÃ±a y para seguir probando todo el contenido de operaciones y Guerra Eterna, por ahora me parece un juego honesto que va al grano y te da lo que promete, cuando lo termine cuento un poco mÃ¡s, pero como primeras impresiones, 10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, it appears as though the dev has fixed major connection issues for coop.

The game is the best Warhammer game out there. There was so much love and detail poured in. It's just a great action game that's not clunky and is incredibly responsive. I want to type more but you should just look at professional reviewers instead of me.

I hope you love this as much as me. My friends and I, including my wife (who is now a 40k fan) have had limitless fun post connection fix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good game.

pros:
- has raven guard
- doesn't have adepta sororitas (no gooners allowed)
- not helldivers 2
- doom soundtrack worthy
- first multiplayer game went against a guy named ""stroke emperor""

cons:
- I'm over here stroking my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I got lotion on my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ right now. I'm just stroking my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I'm horny as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ man I'm a freak man like for real.
- do have to install on a ssd to actually work",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
