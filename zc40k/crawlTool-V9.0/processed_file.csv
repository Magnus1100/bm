Oyun, Ultramarines'in kahramanı Titus'la devam ediyor. Titus, geçmişte yaşadığı olaylardan sonra bir nevi kefaret ödemek için Deathwatch'a katılmış ve şimdi tekrar Ultramarines'in arasında. Hikaye, Tyranid istilasıyla başlıyor ve bu noktada, ""savaştan başka bir şey bilmeyen bir Space Marine"" olgusunu tam anlamıyla yaşıyorsunuz. Titus'un öyküsü, savaşın ve kahramanlığın neredeyse mitolojik bir anlatımı gibi, ama açıkçası ""kahramanlık"" dediğimiz şey burada biraz farklı işliyor. Kahramanlık, daha çok Imperium'u savunma ve düşmanı yok etme üzerine kurulu.

Titus'ı kontrol etmek inanılmaz tatmin edici. Her adımınız düşmanları titretiyor, her vuruşunuz onları yok ediyor. Oyun, sizi düşmanlarınıza karşı uyanık kalmanız konusunda zorluyor. Çünkü sadece güçlü olmak yetmiyor, zamanlamanız ve kaçmanız önemli. Özellikle Tyranid'lerin hamlelerine karşı savunma yapmak, sizi oyunda sürekli uyanık tutuyor.

Warhammer evrenine sadık kalarak, oyun grafikleri ve ses tasarımı gerçekten etkileyici. Games Workshop'un minyatürlerini hayata geçirmişler adeta. Her düşman, her ortam, sanki masaüstü oyununuzdan fırlamış gibi. Savaşın ortasında, gotik yapılar arasında dolaşırken, atmosfer gerçekten sizi içine çekiyor.




Üç oyunculu co-op modu kesinlikle başarılı ve oyunu eğer moda girerek oynayan arkadaşlarınız varsa daha zevki kılıyor.Pvp modu ise her ne kadar Space Marinleri kağıt askerlere çevirse de iyi dengelenmiş ve gears oyunu oynuyormuş hissiyatını veriyor.



Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, güzel bir deneyim. Hem Warhammer evrenine yeni olanlar için, hem de eski fanlar için mükemmel bir tazeleme. Oynanışın derinliği, hikayenin atmosferi ve multiplayer modunun kalitesi, bu oyunu 2024'ün akılda kalıcı oyunlarından biri yapıyor. Eğer aksiyon, strateji ve biraz da karanlık bilim-kurgu seviyorsanız, bu oyunu kesinlikle denemelisiniz. Tatmin edici, heyecan verici ve Warhammer evrenine dönüşünüzde size eşlik edecek güzel bir yapıt.

+Saber Interactive, Warhammer evrenini beklenmedik şekilde iyi işlemiş

Dootslayer,1,173.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050419580/,"Listen brothers! I have waited more than 10 years for this game.
And by the emperor it delivered...with some minor flaws.

When the first trailer came out it hit most Space Marine fans as a huge surprise since nobody
ever expected a sequel to finally arrive myself included, but oh boy we can be all thankful that it did because it's a blast!

I will create a mini section for the 3 main parts of the game, which are the following: The story mode, the co-op operations and PvP.

Let's start with the campaign:
What is your craft? Death.

It's a little bit on the shorter side but it's quite a ride. I try to remain spoiler free , so you can experience it for yourselves.
The gameplay is a mix of the original space marine paired with the horde system with tyranids and it works wonder for this game.
In the early game, depending on the difficulty you picked might feel slightly weak, but:
1) It's required for a healthy gameplay progression (By the middle, you'll feel a lot more potent with the gear you have, and at the end you'll be straight overpowered with a certain weapon combo), and don't forget that tyranids can rip through Astartes especially Warriors.

There is also a surprise enemy later on, which most of you'll probably expect, but it managed to be something new, a faction we never seen in a 40K game before. A breath of fresh air, a welcome change, you'll see.

I'd recommend taking it slow on the ship and taking in the ambience and mini events that happen between missions, they are 40K perfected. The devs clearly had passion and care about the source material.

And the final level: You are going to love it if you like Warhammer. It starts on a high momentum and keeps going and going until the very end. The boardroom meeting about it must have been like: ""How much hype do you want during the last 2 hours?"" ""Yes.""

So yeah, the story mode is roughly 7-8 hours long depending on the difficulty you pick, but it's a ride you'll remember.



The bread and butter of the game for the devs, the mode they clearly have priority on and want to expand further during the first 4 seasons of the game.
It's a mix of Darktide (With the fixed missions that can randomise) , WWZ with it's progression system and horde mechanics, and Space Marine with it's gameplay loop.

Overally it's really solid and has longevity if you like that kind of stuff, you can upgrade your characters and wargear with branching paths, and it's really really fun especially with friends.

There are only a few downsides as of writing this:

1) Class locks. Understandable but you can matchmake with a certain class selected and get dropped into a match in progress where you are forced to switch or quit.
2) No option to host a public lobby on your own. That's allegedly getting changed ""soon"". We'll see.
3) Balance. The balance is fine for the most part, there is only one black sheep , the assault class. It's rather weak, or simply doesn't have it's proper plance among the 6 mainline classes. It needs some slight love.



Not much to say, it gives you vibes of a game that's from 2012...but that's a good thing. You have 3 modes, the classic domination mode, team deathmatch and king of the hill. The TTK (Time to kill) is fast as it should be, and the matches are really fast and fun.

Balance seems fine for the most part, i'v played a lot of matches, unlocked some relic armors and never felt like anything needs a nerf. Of course it's early to tell, we have to wait until the community unlocks everything and some time passes, but so far it's solid.

There is only one big negativity when it comes to pvp: The maps. Don't get me wrong, they are good but there are only 3 maps currently in the game. They are adding more later on, but you can't help but feel like there should have been at least a few more on release.

A short summary for the end:
🟩 Pros 🟥 Cons

-An amazing campaign mode, which makes 40k come alive -That is slightly on the shorter side
-A really fun, classic vibe PVP mode -That has little map variety
-The graphics are really nice and works well with the art design -Technical issues on some systems, i had no problems
-The coop mode is a blast especially with friends.
-It's a long awaited sequel to Space Marine 1 and it delivers

If you read through all that, i would like to thank you for taking your time to do so and have a nice day dear reader!
Also thank you for Saber interactive for making such a banger of a sequel!",2024/9/10,en

 这游戏非常适合手柄操作，手柄的震动适配做的非常好，走路、战斗等等反馈都非常优秀，键鼠的按键过于奇葩，游戏体验也比手柄差很多！
 由于游戏开启需要epic验证，如果遇到问题可按以下方法尝试解决

1.卡epic服务更新:关闭游戏和steam;打开加速器的epic加速;在windows的任务管理器里面搜索epic进程并全部关掉;再打开steam检查游戏完整性;点启动游戏，重新更新epic online service进游戏。
2.epic服务更新完成仍然打不开游戏:进入游戏的安装目录，直接启动“Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2”进游戏。

游戏的剧情背景紧扣在战锤40k的宏大背景之下，泰伦虫族作为一种极具侵略性并且数量庞大的外星生物对人类帝国诸多星球造成破坏，一些混沌势力也在暗中伺机而动，玩家扮演的泰图斯作为帝皇麾下的星际战士肩负保卫帝国的重任并与其展开厮杀!
游戏在视觉效果的表现上便展示出了极高的工业实力，战锤宇宙中各种科幻效果都在游戏中给足了演绎，作为《僵尸世界大战》开发商开发的又一作品，其拿手的尸潮再一次应用在了本作中，密密麻麻的泰伦虫族虫潮给足了玩家紧张于压迫感，广阔恢弘的战场视觉演绎频繁，并且切身融入到玩家的战斗中，给足玩家爽感！

游戏在玩法上保留了非常传统的线性关卡制，没有解密，也没过多的探索元素，战斗上可使用近战和远程两种武器，也都是系列熟悉的一些爆矢枪、能量武器等等，远程射击自然不必多说，但在近战方面游戏增加了不少动作机制，让玩家打的更爽，在敌人发出蓝光时，可以进行格挡，红光时候可以翻滚，完美触发时可以释放枪决，可以理解为一个慢动作高伤害技能，在敌人生命值较低时，可以触发处决，带来杀戮感极强的视觉效果。
不过处决也不仅仅是终结敌人那么简单，也是一种鼓励玩家战斗的方式，游戏中玩家护甲和生命都相对较脆，处决可快速回复护甲并且提供短暂的无敌帧，处决过程中也能触发一小部分aoe伤害，这样的设定下就很难龟缩输出，去脸对脸和虫子硬钢就是最佳选择，也是爽感的主要来源之一。

不过却也并不代表可以无脑贴脸，在面对大量虫子的时候，合理的运用翻滚格挡以及aoe伤害这些才是重中之重，不然在敌人虫海战术下被包围后血条也会消失的很快！

本作的战役部分内容并不长，7-8小时即可通关，并且传统的关卡制玩法下也并没有其他元素，所以很容易腻乏，所以多人部分才是游戏可重玩性的主要体现，游戏分为pvp和pve，通过轻微养成以及团队合作的方式增加游戏乐趣，pve模式下提供六个不同职业可选，不同职业之间有着不同的武器和技能限制，比如特种兵就无法携带近战武器，只有一把厚重的加特林配上一个护盾技能，就非常适合在后方做强火力输出。
此外局内获得的经验可以提升对应角色和武器等级，可以提升武器和人物技能，让战斗更加爽快，在游戏内容不多的情况下这样轻微的养成机制就成了游戏很好的驱动力！
不过目前联机有些问题，经常性会出现匹配进不去游戏的情况，不过根据已知的公告来看已经在修复了，应该后续会更新补丁，目前可以创建任务后直接集结，带ai队友游玩！

总的来说这是一款不错的动作射击爽游，即使不熟悉战锤宇宙，也依旧能玩的很爽，多人为主的模式下后续会保持长线运营，潜力无限！",2024/9/5,zh-cn
userpig,1,95.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/userpig/,"Never cared much about Warhammer until this game showed me the error of my ways and made me cast away the heresy and fully embrace the Emperor's glorious light. No longer do I wander in the shadow of ignorance, for Space Marine 2 has torn asunder the veil that clouded my mortal sight.

With each righteous strike of the chainsword, I felt the will of the Emperor coursing through my veins. The xenos or the heretic—none can stand before the might of the Adeptus Astartes, and now I, too, feel the weight of that sacred duty upon my shoulders. Every battle is a prayer to His undying majesty, every victory a testament to the purity of the Emperor's cause.

In this game, I learned what it truly means to be a warrior of the Imperium: to purge the unclean without hesitation, to stand unwavering in the face of annihilation, and to know that failure is not an option, for failure would mean the death of mankind itself. This is no mere entertainment—this is an initiation into the sacred brotherhood of those who fight for the survival of the Imperium.

Space Marine 2 is not just a game—it is a revelation, a holy writ in digital form, and a reminder that we must be ever vigilant, ever faithful, and ever ready to cleanse the galaxy of those who would defy the Emperor's will.

Poss,1,26.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014929285/,"Summary
Campaign: <15 hours of loreful hack n slash fun.
PvE: Fun with friends, but undercooked, linear and clunky
PvP: Fun with friends, but bare bones and unbalanced

I recently replayed Space Marine 1, and the sequel is a much better game. The visuals, sound and feel are all spot on for a Space Marine fantasy. However, it doesn't quite achieve everything it sets out to, and its secondary modes fall short of other similar games.

Campaign
This is very much a 40k story, with writing reminiscent of a black library novel. That is both good and bad, with the over the top sclock, bravado, action and machismo you'd expect. The grim reality of the Imperium is acknowledged, but on the whole it leans closer to glorification than critique.

The gameplay is a continuation of the first game's mechanics and feel, with chainswords and plasma guns feeling suitably impactful. It is highly linear, without meaningful choice and very little exploration. Being combat oriented and straight to the point is very Astartes, but would have grown wearisome if the campaign were any longer. The scripted executions are similarly timed to stay interesting right up to the end of the campaign, but perhaps not much longer.

There are obvious missed opportunities here. Like the vehicle levels which have placeholder cutscenes but don't let you control them, or terrain destruction which happens all around you, but you can't actually change. its also quite short, at under ten hours if you race through, or perhaps 15 if you take your time and play the optional missions as they unlock.

Still, overall it is an enjoyable romp over a couple of days

This is the bulk of the end game replayability, and the customisation will please many tabletop fans. However it has some key limitations. It doesn't have the visual depth or gunplay of Darktide, nor the endless variety and replayability of Vermintide or Left for Dead. This is a much more linear experience where you replay the same maps over and over. You do get variety from the different classes and upgrades, but progression is largely cosmetic or minor stat buffs.

Beyond the limited number of maps, skills and enemies, there are also pretty limited number of weapons, with quite a few slots having only a single option. You're likely to get dozens of hours of fun here, but maybe not hundreds. The repetition of things like execution animations which started to show in the campaign will become very clear over repeated play throughs of these levels. There is a roadmap with more content, lets hope there is enough in the pipeline to keep the juices flowing.

This is a throwback to a different kind of multiplayer, back to the days of unreal tournament or halo at a LAN party. There is a very low time to kill, and strong reliance on team coordination. There are only three maps with three game modes, so the replayability here is again limited by content availability.

PvP will be fun to play at launch, and if you have a crew together, but may struggle to drag people away from the hero shooters and mobas of the world long term.


This is a fun and brutal distraction for a few dozen hours. For some it will be a realisation of their childhood fantasy, for others it will be a gateway into an addiction they didn't know they wanted. It is a great entry into the set of warhammer games, and a worthy sequel to a fun game. It won't revolutionise the industry, but it does show that going back to basics and delivering what the fans want is a sound strategy for a good time.",2024/9/9,en

"Meat-King, The Ultimate",1,118.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968514473/,"""Blessed is the mind too small for doubt.”

Warhammer 40.000: Space Marine 2 (2024) represents a third-person hack-n-slash shooter game, developed by the company Saber Interactive and published by the company Focus Entertainment. The first instalment (2011) was developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ.



++ The campaign features the beginning of a Tyranid invasion, with all its horrors and endless tides of claws and teeth. Perfect setting for the grim dark future in which every melee execution results in a fountain of blood and guts. In the middle is our protagonist Demetrian Titus, who lets us see and experience the new story around him. That, dear reader, I consider the short-term motivation.

++ Now comes the long-term one, for the excellent integration of the cooperative modes allows us to play the campaign and secondary missions, called Operations, with up to two friends. Four difficulty levels in combination with six classes provide a broad spectrum of replayability. And for the brave, there is Eternal War mode, essentially a 6v6 PVP match that culminates in a battle between Space Marines and the Archenemy.

o What happened to the weight of the power armour? Each step of several hundred kilos of high-quality ceramite should leave an impact, yet the game does not convey the sounds or weight of it in a credible way. Just look at WH40K Boltgun for reference. What about the precision of ranged weaponry? Every time I fire several bolter shots the spread leaves me in disbelief. Any guardsman would severely doubt the marksmanship of that drunken angel of death standing next to him. What about crippling a Tyranid warrior? Unfortunately, not possible. A more detailed hit box with additional dismembering options would have been a great addition.

- Upon first launch of the game, an automatic installation of the Epic Online Services started. This constitues heresy of the highest order! The developers stated: „We can assure you that this was only implemented to support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores.“ Whatever the case, I immediately deinstalled it and the game runs just fine. And so should you, brother.

- A couple of bugs corrupted the holy binary code, e.g. floating items, delayed rendering of textures, clipping and collision issues. Saber Interactive’s tech priests have initiated counter protocols. The Omnissiah knows all, comprehends all.

-- I am shocked to witness the atrocities committed in front of my sacred codex. A simple Tyranid hormagaunt survives a bolter shot, and it takes a magazine to fell a warrior type. A fundamental misunderstanding of the technical background of the weapon. And I will not even start complaining about what they did to my dear melta and plasma weapons. Furthermore, there is a crippling imbalance between ranged and melee attacks, with the emphasis clearly on the latter. Just try to execute a warrior from 10 meters away, let me know how it went. The Inquisition has been informed of the devs’ transgressions; their punishment will be servitude in a penal legion against the greenskins on Armageddon.



The game nails the atmosphere of a Tyranid invasion, and the superb co-op gameplay allows for countless hours of playing the campaign with your battle brothers or prove your team’s tactical prowess in PVE and PVP sessions.

On the other hand, it displays some blatant lore inaccuracies and focuses more on close combat than on firearms, which completely undermines my attempts to crowd control the waves of biomass with ranged weapons. The Codex Astartes does not support this action!

Recommended for determined initiates and seasoned veterans, loyal to Roboute Guilliman, standing firm against the xenos filth in the darkest hours of the Imperium of Man.

我今天只锐评联机PVE中武器设计的糟糕表现。

当一个游戏武器数值非常失败时，表现在于。有八九种可选武器，但是玩家不得不玩其中一把。而那一把不是有多好玩，而是不玩就活不下去。

这个游戏和绝地潜兵存在一样的问题。游戏对于爆弹枪数值最失败的地方在，玩家已经不在乎制作组有没有设计出自动爆弹枪（轻机枪）和重型自动爆弹枪（重机枪）的区别了，而是整个爆弹武器枪族都被打上了‘垃圾’的烙印。

面对高难度，玩家将不得不被迫只能玩热熔武器。谁能想到，帝国精英和载具上最坚固的基石，在游戏中居然是一个连击退效果都没有，打不动敌人防御架势，几百发1吋（25mm）重爆矢才能打死一个精英怪的鸡肋？

当武士虫把双骨刀一架，直接顶着密密麻麻的重爆弹弹幕贴脸砍我时，我在疑惑我手中拿的到底是重爆矢步枪，还是星界军的卡特雷尔激光枪。要知道，爆矢是精金制作的火箭增程弹药，精金不如武士虫的骨刀硬？它凭什么连防御架势都不会破一下？

枪械射击手感方面，1英寸重爆弹设计得像.75爆弹的手感，.75爆弹手感与打击感甚至不如战锤40000：暗潮的贼配军凡人爆弹有打击感。所有为了爆弹枪而来的玩家都会因此失望，因为在这个游戏中，你们和朋友在游玩时的远程武器，只有弹容量极低的热熔武器才能帮你们活下去，选择爆矢枪就是选择辜负神皇而死。

后面我要对制作组说一说游戏模式设计问题。

联机PVE，为什么你们不设计开放地图，像绝地潜兵2一样，把我们用跳帮空投舱砸下去，给我们指定任务目标，让我们自己去完成？这不比你们设计线性地图更新要快，可玩性更高？

阿斯塔特五人跳帮舱多么经典的设计，难道制作组一次都不会让玩家体验到轨道空降？如果没有轨道空降。每次都搭乘雷鹰炮艇，我作为阿斯塔特甚至不如星界军的艾丽西亚空降兵。没有经历过轨道空降打击的阿斯塔特，配叫阿斯塔特吗？根本没有精神！",2024/9/9,zh-cn

Sum-Up
In-depth analysis further down.

Follow our Curator page, , to see more high-quality reviews regularly.
























“In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war”. A historical quote that single-handedly resumes the bleak, brutal universe of 40K; humanity spans the stars, its society on the verge of collapse and only carried by a fanatically-rooted war economy. SM1’s protagonist, Titus, returns as the main character and is sent on a mission to defend the Imperium; this time around, insect-like Tyranids and the Ruinous Powers of Chaos.

The tale of Titus and his two Ultramarine companions is lore-accurate and engaging — 40K fans will catch many references and bits a newcomer wouldn’t, but that doesn’t make it unenjoyable if you’re new to the franchise. Characters aren’t one-sided and have solid narrative depth; the feeling of being an important cog of the Imperial war machine — but a cog nonetheless — is conveyed perfectly, as it should be.

Visually and artistically, few games can equal the desolate beauty of SM2. From the enormous Tyranid swarms laying waste to all, to the iridescent distortions of Warp powers and the blasts of Cadian artillery, everything looks and sounds amazingly crisp. Settings are varied and rich in detail, with more than a few impressive landscapes. Weapon sounds, dense effects and excellent voice acting only give further emphasis to the action-packed battles you’ll engage in. The gory finisher animations, different based on the enemy faced and weapon used, add great emphasis to the destruction of tougher foes.

Maps are linear, with one path to follow once either all foes are slain, or certain objectives are completed. Still, exploring the few side-areas, nothing more than crevices or branching dead-ended paths, is worth your time. There, you’ll find precious supplies and uncommon weapons that will improve your survival chances: medkits, Relics allowing you to revive once, heavy weapons and ammunition caches. Lore-related Dataslates also can be listened to in order to better understand the events that transpired. There are no collectibles or proper secrets to mention, nor a map, which you won’t need given the fairly-simple layouts and on-demand objective markers.

The superb combat system of SM2 is articulate and skill-based, fully conveying the brutality of conflicts of such a scale and, on the higher difficulties, the lethality of Mankind’s enemies. With one melee and two ranged weapons, you’ll lay waste to all Xenos, but you’ll also need to be careful, as a few hits are all that’s needed (on the higher difficulties) to be slain. A responsive system of dodge, parry and riposte rewards timing and reflexes, restoring your armor so that your health isn’t affected — the latter only restored by special abilities or rare consumable Stimms.

Each enemy is dangerous and behaves coherently to their role, even the lesser ones pose a threat, given their sheer numbers — heavier ones, especially mini-bosses, might even one-shot you given the chance, and their endurance is superior. A substantial array of iconic weapons, from the Bolter in its variants to the mighty Thunder Hammer, Plasma Guns and the devastating Krak Grenades will all become available to you as the story progresses — they’re not infinite however, so use your ammunition wisely. SM2 encourages aggressive playstyles with its armor regen mechanics, as slaying enemies in melee with perfect parries not only will bolster your defenses and allow devastating counters, but also allow the use of your Ultimate ability, making you unstoppable and regenerate health for a short time.

Fights are high-stakes, packed with gore and exciting, with a system that is nearly-perfectly designed for this genre. Unfortunately, your companions, mighty as they may be, will be too dumb to properly assume the best positioning during defense tasks, and can’t be equipped with custom loadouts, unlike yourself. Bosses are all unique, barring a few repeating ones, and extremely difficult to overcome on the harder settings. Their tactics change as they lose health, and usually only a few hits from them spell your doom.

After the Campaign, you’ll have several Operations: PvE missions parallel to the main story that depict critical events and feature another Ultramarine team that helped Titus in the main story. Contrary to the campaign, here you'll have access to six customizable classes, each with unique loadout capabilities and Ultimate skills, other than different passive perks and weapons to unlock as you gain XP after an Operation is cleared. Experimenting with different playstyles and combinations, and upgrading your class, adds solid replay value and good progression feeling. These Operations also have progressively increasing difficulty, with better rewards, such as cosmetics, XP bonuses and so forth, proportional to the difficulty you’ll engage into — however, you won't go far in the harder difficulties without better gear and advanced perks, despite all of the settings being available from the start regardless of level.

The PvP mode, Endless War, has Chaos forces face the Space Marines in a variety of objective-based modes, ranging from the classic Deathmatch to more nuanced ones. It allows full loadout customizations just as in the PvE mode, and is a nice addition for those interested in competing against other players to test their skills.",2024/9/6,en

TowardEson,0,41,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198364924021/,"首先，如果您是一个观望着准备购买的玩家，那么我的建议是：不要买，起码现阶段是这样的。
如果您是一个战锤粉丝，我会推荐您酌情购买，但如果你根本不是战锤粉丝，那么重复第一句。

在这款游戏中，我主要玩的是剑卫（全解锁了），在当下这个版本基本算是小丑之一，只能当做辅助来玩。我的评测也只是围绕着剑卫这个职业的游玩体验来说的。

那么为什么我不推荐购买呢？

剑卫在最开始那个版本无疑爽翻天，回击无脑弹反，插旗为队友提供回血、复活服务，真的很爽。
如果制作组没有突发奇想做平衡的话，那么我就会推荐你买了。

第一点，玩家的机动性太烂了。
大哥，这是阿斯塔特，不是穿了重甲的欧格林，你就比游戏里的凡人跑得稍微快了点，这合适吗？隔壁的暗潮超人都比你所谓的老e神选跑得快。无论是哪个版本，这个都是我一直吐槽的问题，很多大得一批的地图，你又跑不快，顶个jb用，唯一的用处就是在奔跑的路上被各种各样的远程怪狙击怪鸿儒，子弹吃到饱。

第二点，也是最重要的一点，制作组是弱智，特别是平衡方面。

可能有人会喷，哎呀明明是你们一开始说太简单了，要来点有难度的。
他令堂的，我们是想要强者对强者，就是三个数值强大的阿斯塔特们去对战数值同样强大的怪海，而不是你一刀把大伙削成老弱病残再去跟千子和虫子对砍。

平衡性方面的改动恶心人的地方太多了，这里一个个提。

第一，本来剑卫大部分动作都可以后摇取消，现在没了，在干千子的时候，你还得小心翼翼地出招，生怕人家一个红圈不可替连招把你直接干烂。

第二，闪避的无敌帧缩短、回击的判定缩短，你改这b玩意干什么我请问了？是嫌玩家打得太舒服了是不是？你们自己有没有体验过现在的游戏？有没有去用你们那个欧格林的三分之一高的智商去想想，这是不是太超模？是，很超模，超模在哪呢？因为除了回击其他的全是废物！对付不可格挡的红圈你只能闪！一对一你肯定能闪啊，那怪海呢？你翻滚无敌帧一削，只要一翻滚必吃伤害，那我还玩个牛牛啊。

第三，一说到这个回击我就来气，你知道大伙为啥无脑回击？就是因为你们设计的近战伤害是真的真的真的！很tm低！我砍3套不如弹反一次的伤害高，不是哥们，你是奸奇派来强健恐虐的吗？你们有没有考虑过玩家为啥会形成这些打法？你这一削回击，大家都可以躺下睡觉了，一个不小心千子就可以把你打得满地找牙。

第四，你们口口声声说做平衡，表面回调，实际上你们的明削暗改，大家又不是不知道。前三个很多问题，似乎都在你们的意料之内吧？想复刻超级地球可以，直说。
就拿远程来说，我剑卫真的很怕远程，尤其是近身打架，你不能一直举着盾吧？你这盾挡不住后面的枪子吧？你们说降低了近战时子弹的命中率，而结果是啥呢？我接近敌人玩近身战的时候，你们那些b怪就是不肯近战，就是贴着脸掏枪射我，你tm橘前辈是吧“只要这个距离的话，你就躲不开了吧！”是，命中率是降低了，tm贴脸上的命中率可一点不低，我tm满血剑卫n5被一只虫子直接贴脸蒸发了，我用剑打还打不出硬直，人家打我刀刀烈火，那你让我咋办？举个盾给你表演一个？你们动动那猪脑子，这是人能想到的平衡吗？

总结起来就是，恶心人的平衡，还有因平衡造就的近乎失败的设计。

还有，你们这产能有够低的，原神都比你们的产能高一万倍。

我很喜欢这款游戏，阿斯塔特真的很帅，泰图斯的故事也值得津津乐道，但也仅此而已了。

Anyway, this game was great. Played the campaign partially solo and partially coop. Melee is very satisfying and fun. The shooting is also nice but usually feels pretty ineffective given the lower ammo capacity of most guns. The first moment of the game where you see a huge swarm running at you is terrifying but also exhilarating.

I will say the first half of the game was my favorite, as the other enemies later on don't seem quite as fun to fight, but it was still enjoyable. I never skipped a cutscene, as they were really drawing me in even with no knowledge of the universe. The world building, overall art direction and scenery is just impeccable, and I probably spent upwards of 30+ minutes just staring at the vistas.

Болтер стреляет не обычными патронами, а именно реактивными, это чувствуется и в отдаче, и в импакте.

Фоторежим к слову тоже отличный, можно красиво щелкать смешную нарезку тиранидов и еретиков. Мне понравилось

Из минусов я бы отметил очень сомнительный баланс в PVP, отсутствие фоторежима в коопе, и то, что к пятому часу беспрерывной игры моя 4060 потеряла половину кадров, а проц решил устроить прогрев. Но разрабы обещали патч, ждем, не вижу повода дизлайкать за это

Mischief,1,145.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Travesura/,"TL;DR? Yes, I recommend this game, it's simple old school fun, some caveats here and there, regarding multiplayer, some epic shenanigans and, maybe replayability.
But if you want to have fun, it delivers.

I played the first Space Marine years ago, not when it was relaced but a few years ago, and I had fun. This game feels like coming back to that Xbox 360 era, of ""simpler"" games, you just want to burn some time, doing some bombastic and silly violence, it's perfect doing that.
You got a decent and fun to play campaign that can be played on coop with friends, (I recommend because the bots kinda suck), operations that complement the campaign, they are coop missions where you unluck experience and cosmetics, and a PVP mode.


The biggest pro's of this game, in my opinion are the gameplay, just raw fun, it can feel repetitive but, it feels so good that honestly I don't care. It can be punishing in harder difficulties but if you master the dodge and parry system you become an unstoppable killing machine.
The visuals and presentation are spectacular, from the first to the last minutes, I stopped several times to admire the work of the devs bringing to life the 40K universe, and Kudos to Saber, they did a great job. Not just representing the dark and grim aesthetic, the technical spectacle of seeing thousand of enemies on screen, the colors, particles, explosions, textures, blood. Delightful, I can say the same about the sound design and music as well.
The story is there, it's not going to blow your mind but hey, it isn't bad at all. It's a good conduct to the slaughter gameplay.

The weak points of the package, imo of course, are... maybe some optimization, lack of graphic options (ahem, FOV slider), Epic anti cheat and online services, these are kinda silly though, you can uninstall the online services if you don't want to use crossplay, and the anti cheat, well... sadly, a lot of games uses that crap, at least we don't have denuvo, thanks devs. I didn't suffer any crashes of super bad drop of performance even if my pc has some weird specs.
The gameplay can feel imprecise at some points, I'm speaking about parrying some attacks, dodging, besides of repetitive, as I said, I don't mind this, because I just enjoy how fun it is anyway.
The length of the whole package, I am happy with it but, maybe some people is expecting more content, if you see the roadmap there will be more content in the future but this isn't a life service game (thanks lord Emperor) so don't expect seasonal huge updates. Let's see how the devs manage the dlc content, I think it will be all just cosmetics but we will see...

Overall, I enjoyed this game, I had my doubts honestly, the first trailers looked too good, and after playing I can say Saber delivered a good game and a great sequel.
Thank you, after so many fiascos lately it's nice and refreshing to play a game that it's just fun, faithful to the source, made with care and dedication.

Godbrithil,1,21.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Godbrithil/,"Nach über einem Jahrzehnt der Vorfreude, zahllosen Gebeten und gelegentlichem Fluchen, hat Titus endlich wieder seine ikonische Rüstung angelegt – bereit, Alien-Horden den Garaus zu machen. Aber die Frage bleibt: Ist es der lang ersehnte Triumph, auf den wir gewartet haben? Oder nur ein weiteres digitalisiertes Blutbad ohne Hirn und Herz? Wir haben uns die heilige Bolter geschnappt und uns in die Schlacht gestürzt.


Kaum hat man das Spiel gestartet, gibt es keine Zeit für sanfte Einführung oder tiefgründige philosophische Gespräche. Stattdessen bekommst Du eine dicke Bolter in die Hand gedrückt und wirst in eine Armee von Tyraniden geworfen. Der Held unserer Geschichte, Captain Titus, ist der Inbegriff des Space Marine-Klischees: unzerstörbar, zynisch und mit der moralischen Empathie eines Kettenschwerts. Hier wird nicht lange gefackelt – als ob ein Bulldozer gegen eine Horde Wutkranke fährt – rücksichtslos, gewaltig und zu 100% befriedigend. Das Gefühl, wenn Dein Kettenschwert in eine Gruppe Aliens fährt, ist purer Balsam, für die vom Alltag strapazierte, Seele. Strategischer Tiefgang? Vergiss es! Du bist kein Schachmeister, Du bist ein Kriegsinstrument, und Deine einzige Taktik lautet: alles in Sichtweite vernichten. Die kleine subtile Einführung ist dabei keineswegs zu kurz oder lang geraten.


Die Geschichte von Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 ist so episch und tiefgründig wie ein Motivationsposter in einem Büro: Sie ist da, aber eigentlich interessiert sie keinen. Captain Titus kehrt zurück, und mit Ihm die alte Weisheit, dass Worte zwar mächtig sein mögen, aber nichts gegen eine gut platzierte Bolter-Salve ausrichten können. Die Tyraniden fressen ganze Welten, der Imperator schweigt wie immer, und Titus tut das, was er am besten kann: alles zerschlagen, was nicht imperial oder nach Xenos aussieht. Tiefgehende Charakterentwicklung? Fehlanzeige. Dafür gibt’s aber ordentlich was auf die Zwölf – und ehrlich gesagt, ist das genau die Art von Storytelling, die wir verdient haben. Für alles andere, gibt es die Bücher. [/h1]


Was gibt es Schöneres, als eine Horde Xenos in Stücke zu schießen? Genau – das Ganze mit Freunden zu tun. Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 liefert uns einen Coop-Modus, der keine großen Reden schwingt, sondern Dich und Deine Kumpels direkt in die Schlacht schmeißt. Hier geht es nicht um ausgeklügelte Taktiken oder kluges Zusammenspiel – es geht darum, wer als Erster ""Für den Imperator!"" schreit, während er seine Bolter leerballert. Spaß beiseite: Mit zwei weitren Freunden oder Randoms, stürzt Ihr Euch in Missionen die darauf ausgelegt sind, Teamwork zu fördern – zumindest insofern, dass Ihr euch gegenseitig wiederbelebt, wenn einer der Kameraden im Eifer des Gefechts mal das zeitliche segnet. Meine persönliche Empfehlung: Spielt den Coop unbedingt auf dem Schwierigkeitsgrad „Engel des Todes“ (Kampagne) oder „Gnadenlos“ (PvE), denn nur dort kommt der wahre Spaß und die brutale Authentizität des gemeinsamen Schlachtens richtig zur Geltung.


Kein schamloser Cash-Shop, der Dir das Geld aus der Tasche ziehen will, während Du gerade Aliens zerlegst. Space Marine 2 verzichtet auf Mikrotransaktionen, Booster oder etwaige Bezahlmodelle, die Dir das Gefühl geben, nur halb am Schlachtfeld teilzuhaben, wenn Du nicht ordentlich Kohle locker machst. Hier gibt es nur eines zu tun: Töten und Siege feiern.












Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 ist nichts für zartbesaitete Gemüter. Es ist ein Spiel, das sich keinerlei Illusionen hingibt und Dir stattdessen genau das bietet, was es verspricht: gnadenlose, brutale und vor allem unterhaltsame Zerstörung. Es ist, als hätte jemand Doom, Gears of War und die düstere 40K-Welt in einen Mixer geworfen und dabei zufällig den Knopf für ""episch"" gedrückt. Wenn Du also nach einem Spiel suchst, bei dem Du nicht nachdenken musst, sondern einfach nur Tod und Verderben säen willst – herzlich willkommen. Vergiss dabei aber nicht ""Führ den Imperator"" zu rufen.

I'm new to the Warhammer 40,000 games and I want to say that I'm totally going to get into this amazing saga

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 
A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
By: ♡ Helena Meow ♡


The best part of the game:

- Performance 10/10
- Graphics
- Gameplay and all types of finishers (50 in total)
- Variety of Bosses and Enemies
- Very complete customization (Skins, colors, weapons, perks...)
- Co-op / Multiplayer and Story Mode
- Variety of Weapons & Grenades
- Soundtrack
- Cinematics (It feels like you're in a Warhammer movie)

💙

Story Mode:

During the first mission Captain Titus is ordered to carry a bomb to be launched into the atmosphere to kill all the Tyranids on the planet, but when he fails and is about to die he is demoted to Lieutenant for alleged corruption.
After being operated on he is reassigned back to the battalion, but as a Lieutenant and during this adventure he will be with his new companions Chairon and Gadriel who will accompany him on all the missions.
At the end of the campaign there is an open ending in which Titus is sent to another place temporarily which we can see in a future sequel of the game or a future DLC.

💙

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 other game modes:

- Eternal War Mode: 6 vs 6 PVP matches in 3 different game modes (Conquest, Capture and Control and Annihilation)

- Operations Mode: Co-operative Story Mode for up to 3 players that has a total of 6 missions (Recommended to play after completing the campaign)

💙

Totally recommended game without a doubt.
One of the best games I've played this year and I'm very happy with this purchase, which hasn't had any launch errors.
The 2-year wait has been worth it because they've released a game that's worth it.

Mabi[N]ogi。,1,35.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MABINOGI_Reborn/,"先说结论吧，目前不建议路人跟风，战役体验是合格的，但当前内容量不值得全价购买，联机PVE和PVP体验都不好。

1.关卡
战役演出很棒，大场面做的尤其震撼，每个怪都至少有三种以上的处决动作，屠杀小怪，撕裂精英的爽感是目前独一份的，但是仅限于低难度，一旦难度调高以后，以“弹反、闪避”为底层的动作设计和极限堆怪的关卡就会给你吃屎一般的体验，怪物刷新没有逻辑，数量多，而且是从各个方向来的，没有安全区，掩体极少，从四面八方包围你的远程小怪甚至可以穿墙射击你（可能是bug），而你低性能的远程武器和容易见底的弹药量很难隔着怪群把他们清理掉，你的韧性很差，雷锤蓄力出手都会被人一拳打飞，更不用说混在杂兵里的多只精英近战怪让你几乎没法打完一个完整的近战连段，更不要说穿插在几乎无休止怪潮里的“拯救天线”这样的任务目标，如果是带着两个不会做事的NPC那你更是痛不欲生。
另外，战役打完并不会给任何的奖励，只会解锁几个合作关卡，这使得对玩家而言战役没有任何重玩价值。而合作关卡的后面几关又十分的恶心，导致联机PVE几乎只会选择前两关，本来做好的12张图，只有2张甚至1张被玩家选择重复游玩，玩家只能在为了效率选择枯燥和为了新鲜感吃屎中二选一。

与其说是不平衡，不如说是近战和远程武器整体上的性能极差，不匹配怪物的数量与强度，枪械的定位接近于普通射击游戏的步枪冲锋枪等，但你的敌人是几刀一个星际罐头的武士虫，混沌的加特林火箭弹还会瞬移的韧狗罐头，面对他们你除了不停翻滚或者找机会弹反，在进攻端几乎没有什么有效的反制手段，目前唯一能把多个精英控到死的貌似就只有热熔枪，而爆弹枪甚至无法给精英打出任何硬直。而近战，有更高的技术水平要求，上限却是更低的。
以上原因导致在中高难度，也就是仅仅从难度2开始的PVE中，玩家的选择就十分有限，除了热熔枪，就是高伤害的狙和榴弹把怪物灌死，本应作为常规手段的自动火力和近战是完全缺位的。

目前养成系统非常简陋，PVE产出：
①职业经验→升级，点职业天赋
②武器经验→武器升级、升阶需要→武器精通后给武器天赋点数
③武器数据→用于武器升阶，与难度硬捆绑，也可以用来直接精通你不想练的武器
④货币→点职业天赋、购买武器、购买纹章配色护甲配件都需要
可以发现除了经验和货币以外，唯一产出的特殊道具就是武器数据，而武器数据很快就会溢出，一类武器升阶只需要一个，这样的系统使得玩家的目标很少而且重复，极易腻烦。所有关卡的产出都是几乎一样的，这也使玩家只会选择1-2个最轻松关卡去刷。当然我也不觉得刷词条是多好的设计，但确实缺乏多样性。
PVP唯一的养成就是获得对战经验来解锁对战等级，从而解锁各职业可以配置的武器种类。

PVP对战本身的设计只能说“一般”，就是非常普通的射击对战，而这个游戏最大的特色动作系统，在PVP中反而隐身了。
而PVP最重量级的问题是：
①没有系统！
除了对局以外，没有任何系统，没有排位，没有赛制，匹配全靠缘，只有按经验积累的玩家等级和职业等级给你看看。
②作弊！
制作组对反作弊几乎是躺平的，除了一个人见狗嫌对作弊没有一点作用的小蓝熊以外，没有任何措施！连举报按钮都没有！我甚至怀疑制作组都不会进行封号处理，PVE你们无限雷刷刷也就算了，来这图一乐的PVP里面也恶心人是吧，特别是10号普通版解锁以后，被某些一看就是来中国旅游的杂种败类隔空秒全场之后，大伙都老实了。谁能想到作弊畜生里十个有九个都是自学中文的外国友人呢。

除了中间加一点细节的过渡套装以外，每个职业只有2套外观，按场次解锁，此外可以解锁的外观少之又少，序章的套装也只有几个部位供你解锁，当前自定义的自由度基本只体现在配色上。

以我个人的配置来说，优化没有任何问题，同等水平画面的游戏也很难找到比这游戏优化更好的，40K暗潮我都需要单独调整设置才能不卡，这游戏默认设置除了电梯载图和最大波虫潮以外帧数都是稳定的，对比泄露工程版的三四十帧差异非常明显。
小问题是真的多，包括但不限于：
默认选择副显示器，你改完设置重启他还是给你默认选副显示器，只是设置里的显示器1和2调换了；
先行版第一天PVE载入不了服务器，但第二天修复了；
某些时候受击会导致人物动作卡住，卡几秒之后要翻滚才好等等……

总体而言，这个游戏质量合格并且我非常喜欢，而且问题虽多，但大部分的问题改改数值和天赋就能极大优化体验，PVE和PVP系统需要大改，特别是封号不跟上的话，这PVP谁也别想玩了。美术方面产能的缺口很大，需要新地图、新关卡、新怪物、大量新的自定义护甲，不然就只有等级可以刷了。因此这个游戏并不推荐当前全价购入，只打战役的话体验合格但只有不到十个小时的流程，想打高难度则需要一定理解和练习，如果没有正确认识盲目跟风的话只会花钱受苦。",2024/9/10,zh-cn

Souffle,1,34.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Esmeralda04/,"아쉬운 점이 없는 것은 아니지만, 그래도 기대 이상으로 나온 게임


워해머 IP는 IP 이름 값과 팬덤 규모에 비해 판타지 세계관으로 나왔던 워해머 토탈워, 40K 세계관에서는 던 오브 워 시리즈가 한 때 흥행했을 뿐, 매번 애매한 규모나 평가로 나와 게임 관련 수난사에서 꾸준히 언급되는 IP 이다

이러한 원인으로 게임즈 워크숍의 깐깐한 판권 관련 문제 (대표적으로 다크 타이드에서 너글만 나오는 것이 대표적)와
미니어처 매출과 관련해서 게임 개발에 한 두개씩 관여하고 있다는 이야기가 해외에선 꽤나 자주 언급되는 추측이었다.

저러한 이유들로 인해 메이저 게임사들은 해당 IP 사용을 꺼리다 보니
스팀에 넘쳐나는 복합적 ~ 대체로 긍정적 게임이 양산되던 와중에

월드 워 Z로 게임 개발자체는 무난하지만 본편은 부실한 대신에 사후지원 및 운영 능력은 괜찮다고 평가를 받은 세이버 인터렉티브가 과거 렐릭이 만들었던 스페이스 마린의 후속작을 개발한다고 하였을 때 사실 기대보다는 우려가 좀 더 많았다.
월드 워 Z 본편은 출시 당시에 여러 기술적 이슈도 많았고 이후 업데이트로 여러 맵들이 추가되기 이전에는 컨텐츠가 적었기에 생각보다 길게 즐길 요소가 없었기 때문이었다.

이러한 몇몇 문제점은 이번 스페이스 마린2에 여전히 존재하는지라 아쉽지만, 그럼에도 이러한 아쉬움을 극복시킬 만한 도파민 요소가 게임에 상당하다.


1. 스페이스 마린에 어울리는 액션 연출

제작진이 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈에서 많은 영감을 받았다고 공개 당시부터 꾸준히 언급하였는데, 실제로 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈에서 볼법한 잔인하면서도 쾌감넘치는 연출과 플레이 방식을 보여주고 있다. 이러한 부분은 스페이스 마린의 케릭터성과도 잘 어울리면서 워해머 40K 세계관에도 어울리는 지라 전반적으로 개발진의 선택이 매우 뛰어나다고 볼 수 있다.
전작의 경우 일부 점프팩을 쓰는 경우 제외하면 케릭터가 묵직한 느낌이 적었는데, 이번에는 전반적으로 묵직하면서 살아있는 병기라는 느낌을 잘 살렸다고 느낀다.

2. 비주얼

지나치게 단조로웠던 전작, 스페이스 마린 1편과 달리 보다 다양한 배경을 보여주면서 게임 하는 내내 배경 보는 재미를 제공해주고, 워해머 40K 팬이라면 좋아할 디자인과 아트 스타일, 월드워 Z에서도 보여주었던 물량 연출 등 게임의 비주얼은 전반적으로 뛰어난 편.
다만 요구 성능 대비 퍼포먼스는 좀 아쉬운 편이라고 느낌.

3. 장기적으로 기대되는 운영

전작 월드 워 Z의 경우 본편에서는 상당히 컨텐츠적으로 많은 문제를 지적받았으나 이러한 문제를 지속적인 사후 지원으로 꽤나 많이 개선시켰으며, 이번 스페이스 마린2의 경우에도 장기적으로 PvE 모드 및 맵, PvP 관련해서 업데이트가 될 예정이다.
이들이 전작에서 보여주었던 사후 지원의 모습만 유지한다면 게임의 장기적인 수명에 좋은 영향을 줄 것으로 보인다.

4. 꽤나 기대 이상인 PvP

PvP 베타를 하려다가 캔슬했었기에 해외에서는 PvP에 대한 기대치가 출시 직전까지만 하더라도 박살난 상태였는데, 의외로 할만하게 뽑혔다. 현재 FPS 게임 시장을 점령하고 있는 콜 오브 듀티로 대표되는 아레나류, 카운터 스트라이크, 발로란트로 대표되는 5 vs 5 와는 조금 다른 느낌인데, 개인적으론 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈와 콜 오브 듀티의 특정 모드가 약간 쓰까진 느낌이다. 현재까지의 메타로는 무지성으로 런앤건을 하려고 하면 순식간에 죽기 일수이며 포지션에 따라 6 vs 6 대치를 적절하게 해가며 팀원들이 모여 한타하는게 주인 것으로 판단됨. 다만 밸런스 자체를 그리 신경쓰고 만든 느낌은 아닌지라 핵과 별개로 장기적으로 가기에는 조금 많이 부족하다고 느낀다.

5. 부족한 현재의 컨텐츠 및 미션 다양성

다만, 평론가의 평가도 그렇고 즐기는 사람들이 입모아 말하는 단점으로는 절대적인 컨텐츠 양 자체가 좀 적은 편이다.
캠페인 자체는 난이도에 따라 편차가 존재하지만 8~12시간 정도면 엔딩을 볼 수 있으며 출시 기준으로는 주요 PvE 컨텐츠인 작전의 맵은 6개 밖에 없다. 그리고 호드 모드 및 추가적인 PvE 컨텐츠는 추후 업데이트 예정인지라 헬다이버스2로 터져버린 PvE 파이유저층이 이를 대체할 만한 게임을 지금 당장 찾는 것이라면 부족한 컨텐츠로 조금 실망할 수 있다. PvE 게임 치고 파고들 요소는 적은데 단계별로 높아지는 난이도를 제외하면 분석하고 도전적으로 할 요소가 현재까지는 없다.

6. 은근히 체감되는 기술적인 이슈

AI가 좀 구리다는 점, 플레이 하다보면 꽤나 쉽게 버그를 찾을 수 있으며, 서버가 불안정한지 PvP나 PvE를 하다가 지연되는 경우도 상당히 많다.


전반적으로 개발사 특유의 단점, 부족한 본편 컨텐츠, 기술적인 이슈는 여전히 존재하지만
개발사가 전작 월드워 Z에서 보여준 사후지원을 생각한다면 조금 길게 봐야 할 게임으로 보이며,
IP의 매력이 뭔지 정확히 파악해서 이러한 부분으로 게임의 전반적인 설계 및 디자인을 잘 구축하여
단점을 많이 상쇄시켰다는 점에서 여타 각종 장르에서 무지성으로 양산되던 B~C급 워해머 게임과 달리
무난하게 잘뽑혔다고 느낀다.

워해머, 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈의 팬이거나
당장이라도 PvE 관련해서 도파민이 급한 유저라면 정가 구매를
만약 워해머나 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈에 문외한이면서
PvE 장르를 가볍게 즐기는 그런 유저라면 세일가로 구매하는 것이 좋아 보임.",2024/9/10,ko

EPIC联机问题

本作也采用了豪华版先行体验的形式，先一步表示忠诚也先一步接受考验，先一步体验bug，但当游戏开头出现EPIC联机服务时，确实让我提心吊胆了起来，但是还好EPIC并没有阻止我，更多的是开启就崩溃。但相信很多好兄弟仍被EPIC服务更新所困扰，给大家提供两点解决办法。
1.卡epic服务更新:关闭游戏和steam;打开加速器的epic加速;在windows的任务管理器里面搜索epic进程并全部关掉:再打开steam检查游戏完整性;点启动游戏，重新更新epic online service进游戏。
2.epic服务更新完成仍然打不开游戏:进入游戏的安装目录，直接启动""Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2”进游戏。
游戏单机的情况下的游玩体验并不算优秀，AI队友苦不堪言，并且敌人会集火于你，单人想要打高难度还是颇为困难的。最好是能找到好友一起玩，可以试试UU加速器联机，不仅能帮忙解决进游戏的问题，还能用云存档服务为你的存档保驾护航。

本作的主线剧情战役模式流程较短，普通难度下基本十来个小时就能完成主线剧情。玩家在主线剧情中将会扮演回归极限战士队列的副官德米特里安·泰图斯，带领三人小队冲锋陷阵，完成一个个不可能的任务，表达对帝皇的忠心，洗清自己的嫌疑，赢得荣耀。游戏的剧情非常不错，很纯正的一本道线性剧情，非常还原，也不会有太多谜语人之列，很清楚，即时是纯路人也能得到很好的体验，我相信系列粉丝能体会到的更是能原地高潮，游戏中也有大量原著中的彩蛋等等。更不要说本作有中字中配，中配的效果也非常不错，搭配上宏大史诗的战斗，怎一个爽字了得。
除了战役模式的主线剧情之外，本作还有六个地图的PvE行动模式，以及几个PvP模式，含有团队死和占点等经典模式。讲实话来说，游戏的内容并不算太多。

游戏中玩家能够使用的武器包括一个主武器，一把手枪和一个近战武器，当然，随着行动模式和PvP中兵种的改变能够携带的武器种类会有所不同，与战锤背景十分相衬的是游戏的中主要鼓励的攻击手段是近战，拿着链锯剑等一系列武器将敌人撕个粉碎。而在战斗中也是这样，玩家手中的远程武器的弹药量收到严重的限制，对于一般敌人来说，远程武器还稍可应对，但当面对稍微强一点的精英小兵时，近战就显得格外重要，近战攻击不仅能大范围造成伤害，对更大范围的敌人造成打击，在面对精英敌人是也同样方便进行破防等一系列操作。敌人的近战攻击大致分为三种形式，普通没有提示的攻击，更快的蓝色攻击和，不可防御的红色攻击，蓝色攻击可以通过格挡来造成硬直与伤害，会使小怪直接被处决。精英怪则会丧失三分之一的血量，游戏中精英怪的血量通常用三个格子来表示，三格打空便可进行处决，处决会恢复三格护盾。玩家承受伤害的大头也围绕护盾展开，通过枪决近战处决敌人获得护盾以达到在战斗中进行循环，而有限的远程子弹也导致玩家使用近战会获得更大的收益。
不过该说不说的是，虽然游戏中鼓励近战，但单人过剧情的话又会存在不少的远程敌人，这一点确实难受，尤其是远程脑虫，飘在天上不下来，队友又吸引不了火力，敌人只会集火你，如果躲避的话输出空间非常小而如果正面作战的话，还需要同时注意周边大量的其他小怪和精英怪，一个稍不注意，一虫一刀就给你来个重伤，可能忙活了半天结果竹篮打水一场空。尤其是高难战斗，跟爽游压根没有关系，玩家能选择的手段也较为有限。

游戏中单人部分和多人部分则是两种不同的养成方案，主线剧情基本没有养成系统，有的只是随剧情推进解锁的可使用的武器等等。而联机部分则采用了大量的肝经验进一步解锁新等级的武器，提升人物等级，从而获得一些被动技能形成build。这一部分的内容就显得较为枯燥乏味了，毕竟游戏的地图并不多，重复肝的确会让人感到厌烦。但更少的内容更显得游戏内容扎实，游戏手感扎实，枪械设计精良，刀刀砍肉的制作令人血脉喷张，基础内容扎实至少是能够爽一段时间的。",2024/9/10,zh-cn

用語解説

・コーデックス・アスタルテス(Codex Astartes)
「戦いの聖典」と翻訳されることもあるスペースマリーンの交戦規定。
内容は軍の組織や戦術など、交戦の時に参考できるマニュアルに過ぎないが、
これが作られた時代から１万年以上過ぎた今はもはや聖書みたいな扱いになる
この世界でのスペースマリーンが絶対に守らないと行けないルールみたいな感じになった

ゲームの中でタイタスが異端として告発された理由の一つが、
このアスタルテスを従わずに柔軟に行動したのも大きい。
本編でも落下する飛行機からジャンプパックで脱出しようと提案した時に
「それはアスタルテスにはないです！」と抗議するシーンがある
つまりこの世界はアスタルテスに書かれてないことをやると異端審問にかけられることがある

・アスタルテス(Astartes, adeptus astartes)
注意してほしいのは（w40kを複雑にする要素の一つでもあるが）
実はアスタルテスにはもう一つの意味を持っている。
単にアスタルテスと言う時はアデプトゥス・アスタルテスのことを意味する時があり、
これはスペースマリーン自身のことを意味してる。文脈によって解釈するしかない。

・デスウォッチ
対エイリアン特化部隊。最戦線で戦うため一番危険な任務を行う。
懲罰として送られてくるケースもよくある。
とにかく過酷で有名

・ブラックシールド
スペースマリーンの肩には出身地や身分を表示するための文章が刻まれているが、
いろんな理由により出身を隠すためにそこを黒く塗りつぶしたデスウォッチ隊員
デスウォッチが過酷でとにかく人員が必要なので出身を問わないで人を雇うための制度

Twiig,1,44.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/twiig/,"Review After 100% Achievements

Coming from someone who has little to no Warhammer 40k knowledge or experience, I had an awesome time playing through the story and operations in Space Marine 2! I just obtained all achievements after finishing the game this weekend in the early access launch period, and I’m glad to finally have this one done after grinding xp and kills for hours on hours. Space Marine 2 has pretty much three different branches of content; the Main Story Campaign, Operations (PvE), and Eternal War Mode (PvP). For me personally, the campaign was good…not bad but not great. Eternal War has potential but there isn’t a whole lot of variety with 3 maps and 3 game modes at launch….I know in the roadmap there is more planned which is great! The Operations were the highlight of my time with the game. Character customization and class progression feels killer, and I really liked the different difficulties. Visually the game looks amazing, performance wise I did have a few crashes/freezes and some connection issues when connecting to others. Crossplay worked decent during the campaign and operations, but I really wish there was a way to turn on/off cross-play in PvP since I’d love to team up with my brother who plays on his PS5. Overall, the hunt for the grindy achievements like maxing out a class or killing 41k enemies was what fueled my desire to complete this game and it feels great to add this one to the list!

加载时长令人发指，开游戏，洗个澡，喂个猫，听首歌，说不定还在加载游戏资源。但是进去了以后只要不退，都还能接受。
剧情里面，你仨正直正确人兄贵就是超人，你砍，你射，你颅献王座；

任务里面，你和剧情里的大头兵没有本质性的差别，怪物刷新逻辑简直可怕，遇到过从头至尾零星遭遇，打完最终防守/BOSS，走人；也遇到过两波武士虫+狙虫共计20只，两头夹你，打到生活不能自理。
难度曲线很迷，基本大多数典藏版老鳖都卡在第二阶武器。第三级精工要打难度3，小毛虫爆弹枪要4-5枪，而你只有180发备弹，还找不到补给，因为这也是加难度的一部分。

这三天和很多中外锤粉组过队，很多穿着圣物铠甲，拿着破刀烂枪，大家相视一笑。
你没有高级武器，你打不过；你打不过，所以你拿不到高级武器。闭环。

据现在看，我自己最喜欢的飞兵，就是个废柴，先锋兵，也是废柴，战术小队，也别想用爆弹枪，也是废柴。你只能热熔糊脸，赌上性命。你非要玩近战，那就靠BUG大佬用狙击兵带你，无限子弹无限潜行。但带出你最高级的装备，你还是啥都打不过。尴尬。
*顺带，其他武器圣物都有复数个外观，至少炫酷，飞兵最后四把圣物锤，长得一模一样，大拳套也是如此。

我锤粉了24年，结合我的专业，走上这条爱WH的路，这款游戏，比起之前的1代，进化了很多，但还是值得我骂。
很多东西诚意不够，很多超出技术层面的东西强行加入。希望以后会修吧。

shaikhulud,1,34.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shaikhulud/,"Rarely do I finish games in one sitting and Space Marine 2 is an absolute blast from start to finish. So it's a rare game from that list.

I do understand that people are struggling with some issues here, but for me it was a smooth 9 hours sailing from the main menu to the end titles bar a few toilet breaks.

Space Marine 2 is a perfect sequel like Uncharted 2 was to Uncharted 1. It is a living, breathing and brilliatntly realized vision of 40k universe in all it's gory glory and spectacular epicness. I can't find porper words to describe how perfect and true to the setting almost every detail and element is.

We've never seen WH40k universe realized with such care, fidelity and production quality. Never. This is the best WH40k media to date and the closest to the huge Warhammer 40k movie we're all dreaming about.

For non-WH fan it's still a bombastic no-BS-TPS with tremendous production values and surprising amount of polishing and variety. Just ignore the lore altogether and watch in awe at the sights.",2024/9/6,en

- The story mod is awesome but short, around 6 missions with really cool cinematics.

- The online coop is 10/10, this part is where you should enjoy more in this game, is just perfect! and is where you get most of the game time.

- The multiplayer is ""meh"", you have it there, it's an option, you could play some matches but is the weakest point in the game. it feels slow with a lot of awkward situations and gimmicks.

g_divergence,1,11.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gdiverge/,"What can I say... (Edit: A lot apparently)

From the campaign alone I think it was a solid buy.

The combat isn't mind-blowing DMC5/MGSR melee combat action awesomeness, and the shooting isn't quite as tight as more focused cover style shooters, but - and this is a big BUT - you feel like a space marine. How is that not cool?! You're a little slow, a little heavy, but you feel like a 10 foot tall dump truck ready to steamroll anything that isn't painted blue. The weapons don't have a massive amount of variety, but on some reflection, I think its acceptable. Would I have liked to see some of the more insane bits of kit for use? Sure, but that isn't really the ""I am a tactical marine that branches out a bit sometimes"" vibe that Titus gives off. (I would still kill for a terminator armor mission, to be clear.)

As far as the breadth of content goes, it took me just over 9 hours to beat the campaign on veteran, and I plan on going for max difficulty here in the near future. Was it a riveting story? No, not really. But it was good. It feels *authentic* in a way that was refreshing, like I could open just about any 40k book and find something like this in its pages. The story I think actually does itself a disservice in some ways where certain elements are underplayed or resolved a bit too quickly, but still, it had all of the beats it needed to, and a more than appropriate amount of justice to the setting to sell me on this being the actual 40k universe.

Some will see the 9 hour campaign and see that as a deal breaker. If you play on game-journalist difficulty and don't do anything but sprint from checkpoint to checkpoint, I wouldn't be surprised if you could get it as low as 7 hours. For some, 10 bucks an hour is a bad ROI, and if you don't have *any* interest in playing the PvE or PvP, then maybe that's all you'll get out of the game. But hear me out. We are often spoiled with sprawling massive games that suck you in for 100+ hours, and this isn't that. Instead, you get a meticulously, fairly challenging, hand crafted experience with what is perhaps one of the greatest fictional universes ever. That has to be worth *something* even if it means ""I'll definitely get it on sale""

To sum up:

If you are a fan of 40k or just like 3rd person action games, its an easy buy.

The only reason I would say to steer clear for now is if you expect nothing less than Elden Ring: Space Marine edition in the content department for your hard earned bucks (which, fair enough if that's you).

I look forward to grinding through the PvE content over the next week or so, and will probably even dabble in the PvP to check it out as the game gets updated over the next year, and perhaps even beyond!

IF1ndTheSUN,1,66.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BadcarrotJa/,"Space Marine 2 เกมดีย์แต่ฟังก่อนอย่าเพิ่งอวยเงินไม่ใช่หาได้ง่ายๆ
เงิน 1,490 บาทกินหมูทะ สุกกี้ชุด 299 ได้ตั้ง 5 ครั้- แต่แน่นอนว่าเราจะอวยอย่างเดียวไม่ได้ คนที่จะเล่นหรือซื้อเกมโดยใช้เงินจำนวนหลักพันขนาดนี้ ความคุ้มค่าและเวลาในการเล่นต้องสำคัญแน่นอน


Space Marine 2 ความรู้สึกแรกที่ได้เห็น
ผมคิดว่า Space Marine 2 แม่งเป็นอะไรที่โคตระเท่ระเบิดเลยสำหรับคนที่ชอบแนวนี้แต่สำหรับผมนั้น ผมไม่ใช่คนที่ติดตามจักรวาลของ Warhammer 40k เลย จนกระทั่งมาเจอเกมนี้ตอนที่ผมไถหาอะไรดู จนไปเจอคลิปของ Asmongold ที่เขาดู Space Marine 2 ในวันที่ 25 พ.ค. 67 ผมคิดว่ามันเป็น Trailer ที่โครตบิดา มารดาเท่จัสๆ จากที่ผมได้ดูในวันนั้นผมก็เลยคิดว่าควรรู้ประวัติหรือ Lore ของ Space Marine ไว้หน่อยก็ดี เพื่อที่จะได้อินกับเรื่องราวของ Space Marine ในบางส่วน ผมเลยไปดูช่องของคนเล่า Lore ต่างๆ ของ และได้ถามเพื่อนที่รู้จัก Lore ของ 40k ความรู้สึกที่ได้รู้เรื่องราวก็แบบเชี่ยยยยย แม่งโครตเท่ไปเลยหว่ะ หลังจากนั้นในวันที่ 22 สิ.ค. 67 ก่อนเกมเปิดสำหรับคนพรี 2 สัปดาห์ผมเลยจัด ไปเลย ถือว่าได้สนับสนุน Developer และบอกไปในตัวเลยว่า ""เกมของคุณโครตเท่เลยนะ ผมถึงซื้อ Ultra Edition ของคุณ""



ผมคิดว่าเป็นเกมที่ผม มากและแม่ง Space Marine ไม่รู้ว่าจะโคตรเท่ระเบิดไปไห- สำหรับคนที่ไม่ได้ติดตามโลกของ แบบผมที่เพิ่งมาดู Lore หรือใครที่ได้ดูประวัติกับ Lore ของ Space Marine มาก่อนแล้วมาเล่น ผมคิดว่าน่าจะ แบบนี้แบบ และรีแอคแบบ นี่คือความรู้สึกผมที่ได้มารู้ แต่สำหรับคนอื่นน่าจะความรู้สึกคนละแบบกัน แต่ผมเล่นไม่จบบอกมากกว่านี้ไม่ได้ บอกได้แต่ความรู้สึกเพราะไปเล่นแต่ PVE



ผมตอบเลยว่า PVE ดีย์สนุก ภายใน 30 ชั่วโมงแรกเท่านั้นหลังจากนั้นคุณจะเบื่ออย่างแน่นอนผมรับประกัน เพราะว่าเมื่อคุณเล่น PVE และเลือก Class ใด Class นึงที่จะเป็น Class หลักของคุณ และคุณปลดล็อคชุดของ Class ที่คุณชอบนั้นครบ + เวลตัน, ปืนทองมีครบ, Skills Point ของปืนตันทั้ง 3 ปืนทั้งปืนหลัก, ปืนรอง, มีด คุณจะไม่มีอะไรทำแล้วเลยนอกซะจากว่า คุณจะไปเล่น Class อื่นและปลดล็อคทุกอย่าง มันก็อาจจะทำให้คุณได้ชั่วโมงเพิ่มสัก 10, 20 ชั่วโมงต่อ 1 Class ส่วนปืนบางอย่างมันก็สามารถที่จะใช้ร่วมกันได้ในบาง Class ส่วนระดับความยากของ PVE ก็มี 4 ระดับ และก็จะมีระดับความยากเพิ่มมาในอนาคต แต่เราจะพูดถึง 4 ระดับนี้ก่อนอย่างแรกก็ ถึกนิด, ถึกหน่อย, ถึกกลาง, ถึกมาก(ในระดับถึกมากนี้ของช่วยจะดร้อปให้เราน้อยลง) ระดับในอนาคตก็คงจะเป็น ถึกเชี่ยๆ ส่วนความถึกของตัวศัตรูก็ขึ้นอยู่กับระดับของปืนที่เราใช้ครับ และความยากของศัตรูก็โอเคครับ ถึงเราเก่งแต่ถ้าประมาทก็ตุยครับ


สนุกที่ได้เล่นเป็น Space Marine ที่ตัวเองอยากเป็นแบบเท่ห์ๆคูๆ

หลังจากผ่านไป 30, 40 ชั่วโมงที่คุณได้แตะ PVE คุณจะเริ่มเบื่อในทันที เพราะว่ามันจะเจอแต่อะไรซ้ำๆเดิมๆ ถึงแม้ว่าเหตุการณ์บางเหตุการณ์มันจะไม่เหมือนเดิมแบบตรงนี้ไปเร็วขึ้น, ตรงนี้ไม่มีอะไรตกลงมาเลย หรือทำไมตรงนี้ผ่านเร็วจังแต่ใน 30, 40 ชั่วโมงที่คุณเล่นคุณก็อาจจะเจอครบหมดแล้วด้วยซ้ำ มันก็ควรที่จะมี Content ให้มากกว่านี้แต่เดี๋ยวเขาอัพเดทในอนาคตต้องรอดูครับ ส่วน Level ถ้าให้ดีก็ให้เพิ่มมากกว่านี้ก็ดีครับ เพราะว่าเมื่อคุณเล่น Class ที่คุณชอบเวลตันแล้ว พอไปเล่นกับเพื่อนหรือคนอื่นๆพอคุณช่วยเขาคุณก็จะได้แค่ของไว้อัพเกรดกับเงินแค่นั้นเลยครับ เหมือนกักตุนของไว้รออัพเดทปืนใหม่หรืออะไรก็แล้วแต่ ส่วนของ EXP ก็หายจ้อยครับ คุณจะไม่ได้อีกแล้ว

ผมเล่น Class ของ Sniper ปลดล็อคชุดครบ มีปืนทอง, มีดทอง, เวลตันตะบี้ตะบันเล่นตอน Day 1 ของพรี SM2 รวม 2 วัน 30 ชั่วโมง เล่นระดับความยากครบ 4 ระดับ เล่นทั้งวันทั้งคืนยันเช้าลืมทำเควสเกม NIKKE ไป 1 วัน(นอกเรื่อง) หลังจากนั้นก็เริ่มเบื่อแล้ว ได้แต่เข้าไปเล่นช่วยคนอื่น และบอกพวกเขาว่า ""ไปเล่นระดับความยากอื่นบ้างเถอะมันไม่ยากขนาดนั้นหรอก กดไปทีไม่มีใครเล่นเลยหาห้องอย่างนาน"" ถึงเจอห้องแม่งเจอโปรวิ่งไว เจอฝรั่งระเบิด Inf, ล้มแล้วลุกเองได้, ยาไม่จำกัดด้วยโอ้โห่เข้ เจอ 2 ตาติดมึงพรีมาเล่นโปรหรอว่ะเฮ้ย เหลือจะเชื่อ ส่วนที่เหลือก็ตามที่บอกนั้นเลยครับ



แถมตอนเล่นตอนเล่นนั้นมันพลาดมันล้ม แล้วมันคงคิดว่าผมเก่งเวลตันฝีมือดีย์หลบเก่งคงมาช่วยมันได้ หลังจากนั้นผ่านไป 2 วิผมล้ม อยู่ๆแม่งลุกขึ้นมาเฉยเลย เพื่อนอีกคนล้มอยู่ใกล้กว่า แม่งไม่ชุบแม่งวิ่งมาชุบผมคนที่ล้มไกลกว่า ผ่่าดงกระสุนนับ 100 เพื่อเธอคนเดียว เลือดไม่ลดสักแอ่ะ ห้อยหลวงพ่อวัดไหนนิจะไปขอสักองค์ แม่งเป็นโมเม้นที่ฮาและปั่นจัด อยู่ๆลุกเฉย Item ชุบตัวเองก็ไม่มี แม่งไม่เก็บอะไรเลยตอนแรกนึกว่าบัค เอ้าสัตว์เอ้ยแม่งโปร



ผมไม่ได้เล่นมากแต่จะพูดถึงความรู้สึกแรกคือสนุก เหมือนเกมเดินยิงทั่วไปของตลาดเกมที่เป็นมุมมองของบุคคลที่ 3 แค่นั้นแหละได้เล่นน้อยในตอนนี้หลังจากเขียนรีวิวนี้เสร็จก็จะไปลองเล่นดูน่าจะได้ไม่เกิน 10 ชั่วโมงโดยประมาณ แต่ถ้าคนชอบก็น่าจะติดเลยครับ



ผมคิดว่ามันคุ้มค่าในราคานี้สำหรับในตอนนี้ 9 ก.ย. 67 เพราะว่าโดยรวมแล้วผมไม่เห็นถึงวี่แววที่จะได้เล่นถึง 200 ชั่วโมงเลย สำหรับผมแล้วมันยังขาด Content อะไรอีกหลายอย่าง ถ้า Plan ที่เขาบอกว่าจะมีนู้นมีนี่อัพเดทมาผมคิดว่ามันจะคุ้มในตอนนั้น แต่ในตอนนี้ 1,490 บาทมันคุ้มค่าที่สุดแล้วเกมที่ดีขนาดนี้ในราคาขนาดนี้และเท่ขนาดนี้มันโอเคแล้วส่วน และ ถ้าคุณมีกำลังทรัพในการซื้อสอง Edition นี้เพื่อจะเอาซีซั่นหรือเอาชุด ผมก็ตอบเลยว่าเอาเลยครับ มันเท่มากๆ และมันเหมาะมากที่เราจะสนับสนุน Developer ให้พัฒนาเกมแบบนี้ต่อไป และถึง Developer จะมีข้อจำกัดหลายๆอย่างในการทำ แต่ทำได้ขนาดนี้ก็เท่และสนุกมากแล้วครับ



1,490 บาทคุ้มค่าที่จะซื้อ เผลอๆคุณสามารถซื้อ Gold Edition ได้ด้วยซ้ำ หรือถ้าคุณมีตังกินหมูทะหรือสุกกี้เกิน 5 ครั้ง แถมเงินเหลืออีกงั้นก็กดซื้อ Ultra Edition เลยครับผมแนะนำอย่างแรง... คุณที่เป็นวัยทำงานแค่อยากกลับมาบ้านมาเสพเนื้อเรื่อง Campaign ของ Space Marine ก็ตอบโจทย์อยู่ไม่ใช่น้อยแต่เชื่อผมเถอะไปดูประวัติของ Space Marine หรือตัวเอก Titus มาก่อนแล้วคุณจะว้าวเหมือนผมอย่างแน่นวลหรือไม่ คุณก็เล่นเนื้อเรื่องให้หอมปากหอมคอ แล้วมาเล่น PVE เลยก็ได้ อยากจะเล่นสบายๆไม่มีเวลามาก PVE ของ Space Marine 2 ก็ตอบโจทย์เหมือนกัน วัยทำงานถือว่าคุ้มค่า Avg ของเวลารวมทุก Mode ผมให้ Avg เวลา 50 ชั่วโมง ถึง 60 ชั่วโมง ครับ ถึงจะถึงจุดอิ่มตัวเล่นเรื่อยๆไม่ถือว่าไม่เหนื่อยเกินไปสำหรับวัยทำงานแบบผมและพี่ๆเพื่อนๆทุกคนครับ. Content ยังน้อยอยู่ผมให้คะแนนแค่นี้พอถ้า ซีซั่น1, 2, 3, 4 ตาม Plan ที่เขาวางไว้มา คะแนนค่อย 9, 9.5 หรือ 10 ครับ เอาความคุ้มก่อนครับ



1,490 บาทคุ้มค่าในราคานี้นะ ไม่เหมาะกับการซื้อ Gold Edition และ Ultra Edition เลย เพราะว่าพวกคุณมีเวลาที่เล่นเกมกันเยอะมาก ไม่เหมือนวัยทำงานที่เขาแค่อยากหาความสุขในช่วงเวลาที่เขาได้พักมาเล่นเกม คุณได้เงินค่าขนมที่คุณพ่อ, คุณแม่, คุณน้า, คุณอา, คุณป้า, คุณลุง, คุณตา, คุณยาย, คุณทวด ที่เขาให้มาแล้วเอาซื้อ Gold กับ Ultra Edition นั้นมันไม่คุ้มเลยเอาแค่ Standard Edition 1,490 บาทคุ้มแล้วครับหรือบ้านรวยก็จัด Gold มาเลยครับผมแนะนำ หรือกุไม่สนก็จัด Ultra Edition เลยครับถือว่าสนับสนุน Dev. นอกเรื่องละ กลับไปที่เวลา พวกคุณต้องการแค่ที่จะเล่นเกมแพงๆให้คุ้มค่าให้นานที่สุด สำหรับวัยสะรุ่นแล้ว Space Marine 2 ไม่ค่อยที่จะตอบโจทย์สักเท่าไหร่ ที่คุณต้องมาซื้อเกมราคา 1,490 บาท แต่รวมเวลาอิ่มตัวมันได้แค่ 50 ชั่วโมงถึง 60 ชั่วโมง วัยสำหรับพวกคุณมีพลัง Power อยู่แล้วแบบแอบแม่เล่นเกมได้ยันตี 3 ตี 4 แล้วค่อยไปเรียนตอนเช้าแล้วแอ็คเพื่อนว่า ""กุแอบแม่เล่น SM2 ถึงตี 3 ตี 4 แล้วกุค่อยมาเรียนหว่ะเพิ้ล แม่งโครตหนุกเลย กุเจ๋งป่ะ?"".. โดยรวมแล้ว 1,490 บาทไม่คุ้มที่จะเล่นในระยะยาวครับถ้าคุณไม่ชอบจริงๆ การที่คุณต้องจ่ายเงิน 1,490 บาทในวัยสะรุ่น วัยเอ้าะๆแบบนี้แล้วต้องรอ Content อีกเป็นปีมันไม่คุ้มครับ ใครที่รอได้รอตอนลดดีกว่าครับคุ้มค่าแน่นอน เกมเขาดีย์ครับ",2024/9/9,th

Однако, когда я начала играть, то испытала непередаваемые эмоции.
В игре шикарные до мурашек виды с готическим антуражем и гигантизмом, проработанность мелких деталей, зрелищные битвы.
Игре удалось передать потрясающую атмосферу вселенной, состояние вечной борьбы, щемящего чувства безысходности, когда видишь накатывающие гигантские волны врагов, но в то же время стойкость космодесантников, храбрость имперской гвардии и превозмогание всех трудностей.
Оказалось, сейчас мне не хватало именно вот такого: недолгая сюжетная кампания не успевает наскучить, коридорные локи концентрируют на миссиях, бои радуют эпичностью, а простой сюжет дает отдых от стремящихся к бесконечности вариативных концовок некоторых игр. Оказалось, большой выбор оружия, собственно, и не нужен, космодесантник с болт-винтовкой и цепным мечом — это органично и вполне себе достаточно)
Как итог, Спейс марины2 так впечатлили меня своей атмосферностью, что я заинтересовалась историей вахи и начала читать книги по вселенной.
Рекомендую эту игру, ведь, возможно, кого-то еще она так же, как и меня вдохновит для погружения в лор мира вархаммера 40к.

Graficos y optimización: 10/10
Si algo me gusta de Focus, es que los estudios que tiene trabajan muy bien en los juegos, es decir, éste juego con una 2080 la mueven en ultra y no baja en ningún momento de 60 fps, todo lo que enseñaron está, nada de Downgrades.

Dificultad: 3/10
No sé que le han hecho al juego en éste aspecto aparte de estar pensado para jugar con amigos, es que al jugar al modo coop e historia se les ha ido mucho la mano con enemigos que te pueden hacer instant kill, que vale que tenga que ser desafiante pero es un juego que estás rodeado de enemigos, no hay forma de hacerlo de forma táctica, pero es que si lo juegas en modo normal, también te dan tremenda ondanada de bofetones, en el coop no han llegado a matar en el nivel más bajo y eso que es el recomendado y no tiene nada que ver con el nivel de tú personaje.

Modo Historia: 7/10
Pues el modo Historia sin spoilers es un muy buen sucesor del uno dándole profundidad a los personajes y al propio mundo pero con unos quizás errores de Lore que están muy cogidos con pinzas, pero dentro de lo que cabe, muy bueno

Modo Coop 8/10
Es la otra parte de campaña del modo historia y al igual que el modo Historia puedes jugarla solo o con amigos, no tiene nada más allá

Personalización: 9/10
Aquí parece que han escuchado a la comunidad porque la mejoría es brutal, pudiendo personalidad independientemente cada parte del astartes, y con un detalle de que los colores son los colores de GW, por otro lado, lo malo, que todo está bloqueado todo y que parte son dlcs, además de que lo peor es que a los Herejes no te dejan apenas personalizarlo, algo que me parece alucinante, espero que en el futuro lo cambien.

Modo Multi: 8/10

Esto no tiene nada más allá de lo que hubo en el 1, mismos modos, en el futuro habrá modo Supervivencia (Exterminatus) y no hay nada más destacable de que los niveles que subas aquí y lo que desbloquees no es conjunto con el modo coop, y es molesto porque hay mucho, demasiado que desbloquear y no da tanto de sí el juego

Nota Final 8/10
Un digno sucesor de Space Marine 1 con lo que uno espera de la secuela, mejoras, más sangra y muerte, y con momentazos brutales, muy bien conseguido",2024/9/8,es
EviL_GhosT,1,55.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/EviL_GhosT_Offical_Profile/,"«ВАРП-ПОРТАЛ В ЗОЛОТУЮ ЭПОХУ ВИДЕОИГР»
Хрестоматийный сиквел. Отличная графика, хорошая оптимизация, интересный сюжет, превосходная шутерная составляющая, а самое главное – это вселенная Warhammer 40,000. Что вам ещё нужно?

МНЕНИЕ

Предисловие
Несколько лет назад играли с друзьями в первый Space Marine. Это был великолепный опыт. Там было всего три кооперативных миссии, но мы затирали их до дыр, потому что было сложно и интересно. А самое главное – было весело. Вспоминаю эти времена с теплотой. Это был хороший шутер по вселенной Warhammer 40,000. Механически не комплексный и сюжетно не обременяющий. Типичный представитель игр того времени.

И спустя столько лет выходит данная игра. В совершенно другую эпоху видеоигр. Но с качествами игр того времени. Возможно, кто-то ожидал большего или просто другого. Это дискуссионная тема, как было бы лучше. Но лично для меня – это самый лучший подарок к моему дню рождения от игровой индустрии. Это как глоток свежего воздуха.


Ещё с первого Space Marine мне нравилось умерщвлять ксеносов из арсенала Империума. Сиквел лишь улучшил данный процесс. Какой же кайф расстреливать тиранидов из тяжелого болтера. Он стал куда эффективнее, чем в прошлой части. Но на нём арсенал не заканчивается. В игре предостаточно видов вооружения – от боевого ножа до мультимельты. Из всего интересно стрелять и за все классы в кооперативе интересно попробовать поиграть.

Да, здесь геймплей состоит из перемалывания орд противников. И мне нравится. Наверное, это 90% игрового процесса. Остальное – это сюжетные вставки, нахождение на барже, ожидание в лифте и любование пейзажами – офигеть какая игра красивая. Но не думайте, что игра даст вам спокойно отстреливать обычных противников – среди них есть особые, элитные противники. Такие противники могут создать вам проблемы, особенно которые атакуют в ближнем бою. На ближней дистанции геймплей из тира превращается в Dark Souls с перекатами, блоком и парированием.

Одно кажется действительно странным – как щиты могут выдержать выстрел из лазерной фузеи? Или почему, когда тиранид скрещивает мечи, то он блокирует все выстрелы с фронтальной части? Только мельта может нанести урон. Такая игровая условность выглядит нелепой.

Ближний бой полезен для всех. По крайней мере, важна система добиваний. Добивания воспроизводятся на низком уровне здоровья противника. Но как они воспроизводятся – моё почтение. Это как современный DOOM, но от 3-его лица. Очень крутые, брутальные и красивые анимации, которые так и хочется воспроизводить. Помимо красивого визуала, вы также получаете +1 к своей броне.

Система брони была изменена. Теперь она делится на сегменты. От 2 до 4. В зависимости от класса, сложности или от взятых вами бонусов. Броня обычно улетучивается в момент от пары ударов или выстрелов. В кооперативе за добивание отсыпают мало – по одному сегменту за добивание. И как-то несправедливо, что одного мелкого из роя можно также добить или отпарировать и получить ровно столько же, как и за элитного противника.

В остальном же мне всё нравится. Это то, чего я ожидал от сиквела Space Marine. Даже добавить нечего.


Тем, кто вливается впервые во вселенную Warhammer 40,000, сюжет может показаться скучноватым. Это можно понять, с учетом, что люди, наверное, уже отвыкли от такого формата игр.

Могу сказать, что мне было интересно наблюдать за продолжением истории Тита. Да, это совершенно не комплексная сюжетно игра – она абсолютно линейная. Но этого и стоило ожидать от сиквела. То, что есть в игре – вполне достаточно для своего жанра. Игра не изобилует геймплейным разнообразием. И тем, кому геймплей не показался сильно увлекательным, могли бы просто устать и испортить себе впечатление от игры.

Сюжет игры радует меня хорошей постановкой, интересными ситуациями и своей брутальной простотой. От некоторых сцен у меня были мурашки по коже. Фанатам вселенной должно зайти многое. И жаль, что незнакомые со вселенной люди не поймут качества проделанной работы.


Плавно стоит перейти к графической составляющей. Я был удивлен, когда первый раз запустил игру и увидел там логотип HAVOK. Глядя на визуал игры, я думал, что игра на Unreal Engine. Но я ошибался – игра сделана на собственном движке от Saber Interactive. Игра радует глаз. Просто нет слов, какие красивые здесь пейзажи и архитектура. И всё это с правильной постановкой света. Вот честно, мне не к чему даже придраться в графическом плане – мне всё очень понравилось.

Слышал, что некоторым не нравится, что всё так линейно что в сюжетке, что в кооперативе. Но знаете, я не вижу смысл в таком усложнении, особенно когда речь идет об игре в жанре тира. Мне нравится, что разработчики хорошо чувствуют во всем меру и не прикручивают лишние элементы там, где это не нужно. Не было моментов, которые могли бы просадить динамику игрового процесса – в игре сложно затупить, где-то заплутать и потеряться. Игра не требует собирать какую-то хрень на задании. Игра не дает нудных заданий или сложных головоломок. Разработчики понимают, про что игра. И это офигенно.


Мне игровой процесс показался увлекательным, поэтому на прохождении кампании я не остановился. Как и в прошлой части, это самый увлекательный и реиграбельный сегмент игры.

В отличие от кампании, в данном режиме повышение сложности куда целесообразнее. В кооперативе появляется чувство прогрессии, потому что вы прокачиваете определенный класс и вооружение. Повышая сложность, вы получаете больше опыта и более крутые данные арсенала (которые нужны для прокачки вооружения).

Единственный минус для меня – нет нужды в тактике. Нет таких моментов, когда нужно взять определенные классы, чтобы получить желаемый результат. Нет явной нужды определенного класса на миссии. С одной стороны, классно, что каждый может играть, как ему интересно. С другой стороны, я вспоминаю то самое время, когда мы с друзьями в первом Space Marine придумывали разные тактики на миссии, начиная с выбора оружия и заканчивая нашей ротацией/нахождением на карте. Это было офигенно.

Сейчас роляют просто ваши персональные способности, ваш скилл. Возможно, позже будет сложность, где это будет необходимо.

Захожу в этот режим частенько спустя почти месяц игры. Пару раз один или с друзьями точно выхожу, дабы искоренить еретиков и ксеносов. Миссий стало в два раза больше, чем в оригинале. Они интереснее, потому что там тоже есть постановка, как в кампании. Много крутых моментов.

Жаль диалогов не так много между напарниками. Они часто повторяются, но они классные.


Поразительно было увидеть столь рудиментарный мультиплеер в 2024 году.

Он ощущается хуже, чем кооператив. Его хватает на куда меньшее время – он быстро наскучивает. Оружие в игре никак не настроить под себя – нет никаких улучшений. Только внешний вид. Уровни в этом режиме открывают только доступ к определенному оружию.

На пару раз зайти можно, но задержаться на долго у меня не получается.


Весьма хороший выбор для персонализации своего образа. Множество орденов, кастомизация для определенных частей тела. Куча реликвий на доспехи и на оружие. Всего этого вы не увидите за Хаос.

Я понимаю, почему кастомизации так мало за Хаос, но... её, считай, что нет вообще. Здесь всего шесть орденов и все они будто бы заточены под определенные классы.

Печально, что Хаосу уделено меньше внимания, чем в предыдущей части. Как минимум, в прошлой части была целая миссия за них. Здесь же они представлены очень скудно


Это одна из редких игр, где складывается впечатление, что всё здесь на своем месте. Всё работает, как надо и нет ничего лишнего. Мне очень понравилось игра. Играю один или с друзьями и просто кайфую.



Обитель моих обзорчиков",2024/10/2,ru
AnFbiAgent,1,93.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1supersecretagentman1/,"I think the game is great, but has a lot of design flaws that can definitely be fixed in a couple months if the devs are paying attention. I understand they had people to please by releasing it this early, but it could've used more time in the oven, as a bad launch can really sour a game's reputation (looking at you Darktide). I'd like to get my grievances out of the way before I name the positives.

Firstly, requiring internet and server connection for a game like this feels strange, and the enemies are definitely tied to the servers as they lag around if the connection is acting up. And not having some basic matchmaking functionality is very strange on release. You can't choose lobbies, you can't choose to host or join them, and you can't opt for a solo run; even worse, there is ZERO reconnecting to a match if you aren't playing w friends. If you get disconnected due to their server mishaps during a quick match, you lose your potential 30 minutes of progress. And on top of that, there is no kick prevention late into a match, so if you really wanted to kick at the very end, you could.

Second, it has terrible optimization all round; it loads horribly slow without an SSD, I have it on an NVME and it still loads slow sometimes. Performance feels really really low for a lot of systems that should run it at a steady 60 FPS no matter what. I have a 4060 ti and it definitely doesn't keep 60 FPS, it routinely drops to 40, not to mention any mid-range systems that can barely run the game in certain scenarios.

Third, is the combat system. It ALMOST feels good. Small enemies tear you up way more than they should ever, armor sustain feels weird in it's current implementation, and so does HP sustain. The whole bloodborne rally mechanic is fine, but there is almost no way to sustain HP outside of the overheal bug, and Apothecary/Bulwark's ultimate ability, 99% of the lobbies I queue on Ruthless difficulty do exactly that because of the current balance. You should get a 5% heal for majoris executions and 10% for extremis, and like 15-20% for terminus. That and the loadout drop pods should heal you to some degree. Armor should have to chipped away by small enemies, it should not be that tyranid warriors are less scary than a group of hormagaunts or shield tzaangors. And we should be able to animation cancel into a dodge roll from any animation, at reasonable frames, as well as cancel into a parry on certain animations. Parry into dodge roll should feel fluid too. being locked into things feels pretty awful sometimes.

The good stuff here has serious potential. The combat when it DOES work, feels awesome. There is a flow state you can find yourself in if the game is really working with you. The inspiration from other games really works with the way they constructed the game (save the dodge roll. Astartes would not GoW dodge roll, the Bulwark side step looks apt though), Between the Doom executions, the Gears of War combat style, and the spawn waves akin to the Tide games (elites, mini bosses, specials, chaff units. Which itself is inspired by the slightly more basic Left for Dead formula) they have something truly addicting with how it handles skill expression and SOMETIMES, difficulty. I like this game, but I would love it if they made some seemingly easy changes. They have the framework up already, so if they really care about their players, they'd make some number changes. Combat is a super easy fix. Matchmaking too. The optimization might take them longer.

Overall, get this game if you think it looks fun, but only if you have decent internet, and an mid to high end PC.",2024/9/16,en

По вахе в целом не так много хороших игр, но Space marine 2 - это не просто пример хорошей игры по вселенной, это пример игры, где люди, за ней стоявшие – настоящие фанатики, которые шарят за мемы, за лор. Шарят как сделать так, чтобы вы не могли оторваться от экрана до самых титров. Орали от эпика, проникались персонажами, а в конце просто в экстазе смотрели титры под чертовски крутой саундтрек, и пускали скупую ультрамариновую слезу, что приключение Тита закончилось (или нет?)).

В целом это ГОТИ (но починить мультиплеер нужно как можно оперативнее).

За очень очень долгое время без нормальных сюжетных игр, похождения Тита оставят мощнейший отпечаток в вашей памяти.

Distemper,1,371.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198320092262/,"主线剧情很不错，但是剩下的多人联机内容（联机PVE, PVP）可玩度不太高，整体内容量偏少（战役只有10小时出头）。另外战斗需要练习，并不算轻松。

作为40k爱好者好评，但不是锤粉不推荐原价入手。
===============================================================
1. 最大优点：剧情战役体验相当不错。
战斗、后勤场景建模细节特别足，40k战争的临场感做的非常好。
NPC对话丰富细腻，人物形象鲜明，宛如一段沉浸式体验的电视剧。

2. 主要缺点：相比定价而言,内容量还是少了，只有10小时出头。
主线战役内容只有10小时。完成之后就剩下多人联机的PVE（支线剧情，讲主线剧情同时，其他小队在干嘛），目前只有6个任务。然后还有PVP，平衡很差基本可以忽略。

十多小时的内容对于这个价格的游戏来说，体量太小了。（作为对比，近期类似定价的黑神话悟空够60小时）


战斗机制决定了这个游戏并不是轻松愉快的爽游，而是需要不停进行快节奏的格挡/闪避-手枪爆头反击-处决的循环。

大部分近战武器的动作并不快，动作后摇长且不容易取消。因此高难度下主动攻击往往容易被怪围殴，只有少量招式实用。远程武器除了热熔之外伤害都较为平庸(狙击只适合少数精英怪，且弹药非常有限)。而格挡-处决可以快速恢复护甲并清空杂兵，收益非常高。

Nice campaign experience, but size of content doesn't match the price (~10h campaign + 6 PVE maps + PVP) .
Combat is not easy and requires practice to excel.

It's the monster rather than player that control the rhythm of fight, parry and counterattack is vital if you want to win the game smoothly.

As a 40k lover I'm more than satisfied with the campaign. But, if you're not a 40k fan, this game is not recommended at full price. (There would be more content in 2025, wait until then if you are interested)",2024/9/9,en

《Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2》是《Warhammer 40,000》的系列新作，《Warhammer 40,000》有着独属于自己极为宏大的哥特式太空歌剧背景故事！在这里人类文明已经发展了40000年，强大的人类文明早已实现了星际跨越，人类帝国在太空的无节制扩展使得势力版图空前庞大，众多强大无比的星际战士以忠于帝皇为信仰，他们始终团结在帝皇周围，立誓为帝皇而战！消灭一切敌对！这也塑就了《Warhammer 40,000》里众多可歌可泣的传奇故事！

欢迎关注 网易UU鉴赏家培养计划
关注网易UU鉴赏家，开启精彩游戏之旅。

荣耀即为我的生命！
游戏的画面风格是一如既往的40K味道，各处场景都充满了黑暗复古的哥特风格，其中又带着一些古典魔幻的高科技，这种看似矛盾又极端契合的画面感结合战锤40K那完整到庞大无比的世界观，那写实主义与未来主义的碰撞融合，而且是极致融洽的融合，也许这也是战锤40K一直屹立不倒并且衍生作不断的关键之一吧！整个游戏过程每换一个场景总能给我们一堆新的视觉震撼，在视觉效果设置调到最高的前提下，说是步步是美景都一点不为过！

游戏全程都有着中文配音，就连配角和路边的路人甲乙丙丁都会时不时蹦出几句，让游戏沉浸感十足！特别是战斗过程中，战士们面对近乎无法战胜的虫潮从四面八方用来，大伙依然一边高喊“为了帝皇！”一边无所畏惧的战斗冲锋，那悍不畏死的场景，那无可畏惧的战场氛围，简直绝了！

游戏起始于外星异形泰伦虫族入侵帝国掌控下的星球，星际战士杀戮小队领命驰援，谁知道敌不寡众加上降落时遇异形袭击，整个小队仅剩我们操纵下的队长泰图斯没有死于非命，于是拯救星球的使命自然只能由我们一力承当！能陪伴我们的只有开局一把链锯剑和路上捡到的爆矢枪！在这个新手教程都能让新手死亡N次的任务里，经过一番苦苦挣扎，最后我们终于在成功发射毒气弹到平流层后，被杀之不尽的异形及其BOSS围杀，在即将殒命之时，救援终于赶到！再次醒来之时，我们操纵的主角已经被改造成为一名伟大且强大的原铸星际战士！更为凶险的传说战斗，就此翻开了帷幕！一切都是“为了帝皇！”

作为帝国最强大的原铸星际战士，帝国在武器库里给我们配备了十数款性能威力各异的爆矢枪、三款可以与近战武器搭配使用的帝国制式手枪和四款威力绝伦的近战武器，以确保我们每次出征都能旗开得胜！不同的款式都有着自己的攻击机制和攻击效果，需要我们在战前给自己好好挑选配备！

游戏的战斗过程简直让人热血沸腾，面对那悍不畏死的异形虫潮，数之不尽的一群一群的汹涌冲杀而来，无论是使用手中爆矢枪进行各种远程弹火喷射覆盖、又或者直接手持链锯剑高喊一声“为了帝皇！”，然后冲入虫潮来一波浴血收割！配合着身边一起战斗的小队队友，那感觉是真的会让人忘记恐惧激动不已的！也许这就是传说中的信仰之力和战友之情？

当然，激动归激动，这实力要是跟不上的话，多次任务失败也是会让人沮丧不已的！虽说我们已经成为帝国最精锐的原铸星际战士，并且手持帝国最为强大的各式武器，而且也有传说：“只要是碳基生物就抵不过重火力！”站台，太奈何真的耐不住异形虫潮是真的太多太密集了哇！在激情彭拜的战斗过程中市场会有一个手雷扔进去炸飞一堆的场景、也有着手持链锯剑一套蓄力横扫打飞一堆的战况，但各位小伙伴记忆更深刻的是，虫潮汹涌过来把我们伟岸的身躯湮没的场景吧！？但这丝毫不影响我们在不停的战斗过程中享受那一套干掉一群的爽快和刺激，荷尔蒙剧增的感觉简直不要太爽！

但激情总有冷却的时候，《Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2》的单人剧情模式实在太短了，基本上十个小时就能通关，而且游戏就是线性剧情，并不存在什么支线一类的设置，就算地图有那么几个没探索过的小角落，里面也不存在什么惊喜和宝藏，有几个留声芯片就已经是最大收获了。因此在通关了剧情之后，也没有什么多周目的必要。

好在《Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2》还是支持线上多人模式的，在此模式下选好职业后会有一些武器使用限制，不停的战斗刷怪来获取掉落更高级的装备也就变现成了最大乐趣！通过战斗提升的枪械熟练度也让游戏有了那么一些养成元素，提升对应的枪械熟练度也就成了与小伙伴们合作战斗爆更好的神装之外的最大追求！当然，线上联机主要还是要注意网络稳定，特别是当队长的，一旦掉线可是会拖着所有队员一起退出游戏的！这里就得推荐一下UU加速器了！使用UU加速器加速网络来进行游戏，足以让你整个游戏过程网络稳如老狗！——小伙伴们再也不用担心网络掉线！

另外，游戏刚开始的时候似乎需要开启epic验证（本人没遇到，但许多小伙伴遇到了），这里给遇到epic验证的小伙伴提供下解决方法：
1.卡epic服务更新:关闭游戏和steam;打开加速器的epic加速;在windows的任务管理器里面搜索epic进程并全部关掉;再打开steam检查游戏完整性;点启动游戏，重新更新epic online service进游戏。
2.epic服务更新完成仍然打不开游戏:进入游戏的安装目录，直接启动“Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2”进游戏。

最后，游戏操作对应键盘键位的设计人员一定是个“天才”，竟然把格挡设计到C键上！这到底是什么鬼畜设计！！！这里还是推荐使用手柄，对游戏操作有更好的适配性！也能让战斗更为舒适！

最后的最后，我们需要赞美帝皇！是他给予我们这么爽快的游戏体验！让我们一起为了帝皇而战！为了忠诚而战！",2024/9/10,zh-cn

The game excels in recapturing the essence of the 2000s and 2010s gaming era with impressive authenticity. The combat system and movement mechanics are exceptionally well-crafted, delivering a gratifying and dynamic experience. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular, offering a visually stunning presentation. While the storyline may not be revolutionary, it remains sufficiently compelling and engaging to sustain the player's interest.

GLB,1,71.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GRZOGRZ/,"Ну вот и вышло долгожданное продолжение. Ждал с момента выхода первого трейлера и внимательно следил за ней до выхода, даже не выдержал и купил голд издание, чтобы пораньше залететь. Так вот, если коротко, то игрулька вышла что надо, прям реально с первых минут лютое месилово и замесик идёт, не говоря уже про ебейший конец, где прям реально заруба на все бабки.

Из плюсов мне прям жутко зашел новый визуал, звуки и работа над деталями. Над этим в игре прям очень хорошо поработали, да так, что я как настоящий вахоеб получал лютые оргазмы в некоторые моменты, по сравнению с первой частью игра ощущается как полноценный проект по 40к. Всякие гвардейцы с их репликами, механикусы и сервиторы, другие космодесы и просто окружение реально круто сделано, веришь что ты участвуешь в войне галактического масштаба, а не в местной заварушке. Куча отсылок на предыдущую часть, а также на события в мире вахи, добавляют антуража.

Геймплей в игре, как по мне на уровне выше среднего, до отличного явно не дотягивает ибо есть косяки и недоработки, однако я думаю что их можно будет поправить после полноценного выхода игры 9 числа. В частности меня расстроила новая система добиваний, которая выглядит (как и всё в игре) сочно, смачно и мега круто, но функциональности в них немного, ибо теперь вместо восстановления ХП после добивания, у нас восстанавливается только значение заряда силового поля. Играл я на максимальной сложности, из за чего, не считая всяких ништячков, которые разбросаны по карте и добавляют немного заряда к броне, у меня было лишь две ячейки, которые даже самые слабенькие противники в игре сносят за пару секунд ближнего боя, не говоря уже про более сложных и сильных врагов. При этом всём, добивания теперь работают только на ""сильных"" противников, а всякая мелюзга просто помирает, из-за этого восстановить даже броню во время боя вызывает трудности, всяких ""синих"" парирований и убийств после оглушительного комбо явно не хватает, так как после одного-двух добиваний тебе сносят всю броню секунд за 5-10 и ты снова с голой жопой вынужден убегать и отстреливаться от врагов. Ближе к концу, когда появляется опыт и нормальное вооружение эта проблема не так заметна, но всё таки она есть. Помимо этого оружия не так уж и много, по сути 50% всего вооружения в игре это модификации штурмового болтера с +- одними и теми же хар-ками, ну и плазмомёт имба кста. Союзники стали реально убивать и че то делать с врагами, это по сравнению с прошлой частью реально плюс, еще теперь враги вас не убивают сразу, а нокают, из этого состояния вас могут поднять всё те же союзники-боты, ну или игроки, если вы играете кооп, и это я считаю реально круто, особенно на максимальной сложности. Враги разнообразные и каждый имеет свою роль, что для такой игры очень важно и заставляет продумывать свою тактику боя в зависимости от арены и вооружения, плюс имеются всякие ""минибоссы"" - мобики с большим количеством хп и особыми атаками, которые реально могут намылить вам жопу. Стрельба ощущается прикольно, в частности из-за звука, да и вообще всё что связано со звуком в этой игре сделано реально круто.

Сюжет же, несмотря на наличием в нём аж трёх разных планет на самом деле довольно короткий, если бы не пве операции и максимальная сложность, я думаю у меня ушло бы часов 8-9 на полное прохождение этой игры. Но по наполнению героями, действующими лицами и сюжетными поворотами игра реально на голову выше первой части, не говоря уже о том, что мы теперь не просто отряд бедолаг, закинутый на пустую планету с орками, а реально целая рота космодесанта, которая взаимодействует между собой и с другими военный организациями, в частности с имперской гвардией (Лейтенанта Миры в этой игре нет=( )

Насчет мультиплеера могу сказать, что проходить сюжетку советую в коопе с друзьяшками на максимальной сложности, ибо тогда будет намного интереснее и намного легче, чем в соло с ботами. ПВЕ операции меня приятно удивили и играются реально бодро и круто, даже с рандомами, плюс кастомизация своего космодеса добавила шарма. В игре можно сделать почти всё что угодно в плане кастомизации, налепить эмблему альфа-легиона на лояльного космодеса и пойти воевать против тиранидов в отряде с кровавым вороном и саламандрой? Да запросто! Покрасить свой доспех так, что издалека вы будете похожи на огромного арлекина? Легче легкого, короче простор для фантазии в этой игре есть и это тоже очень круто, не говоря уже о том, что кастомить можно в том числе ХСМ. Ну а ПВП режим я заценить пока не смог.

Как итог игрушка реально классная, по моему личному мнению она занимает явно топ всех игр по вахе из современности. Тут есть почти всё что надо любому вахоебу: Кровь, кишки, распидорасило, куча всяких терминов из вахи, которые обыватели никогда не слышали, эпичность и превозмогание, болтер-порно (в хорошем смысле) ну и конечно же любимый всеми Лейтенант ТИТЯ, ведь это игра про НАШЕГО РУССКОГО ДМИТРИЯ ТИТОВА. А ну и да игру наши слоники делали, которые завезли НАИКРУТЕЙШУЮ русскую озвучку, так что это тоже жирнющий плюс в копилку игры. РЕКОМЕНДУЮ!!!!

P. S. Большемониторные гои и всякие либерашки с х-менами наставили игре отрицательных отзывов, так что это говорит о том, что игруха реально классная и заслуживает уважения",2024/9/7,ru

ROGNAM,1,20,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ROGNAM/,"An excellent third-person shooter that immerses players in the Warhammer 40k universe.
I'd say the game is a bit pricey for its current content, but a roadmap has already been released with content through to the end of 2025.

The single-player campaign, is the sequel to the first opus and can be played solo or in co-op for up to 3 players. It's really good, but rather short (I'd say 8 hours of play).

Then there's a less scripted co-op campaign where you can customize your space marine and play different classes. It's fairly short, but is designed to be played several times to improve your characters.

There is also the 6vs6 PvP mode, which is really cool. Progression is pretty good, and you want to keep playing to unlock the next weapons and cosmetics, but unfortunately there are only 3 maps and 3 game modes at the moment.

In conclusion, I'd recommend it to all fans of the 40k universe or anyone looking for a good shooter, but I'd advise you to buy it at a reduced price or wait for the developers to add a little more content.",2024/9/13,en

В 2024 году среди всех релизов я ждал именно эту игру. Ожидания были приземленные на уровне ""пострелушка от 3 лица часиков на 6"". С одной стороны так и оказалось, а с другой игра подарила массу впечатлений.

Визуальная составляющая
Она здесь потрясающая. Графика по настоящему выглядит как у крупного проекта 2024 года. Художники отлично передали сложнейшую архитектуру мира Warhammer 40k , при этом, не идя на компромиссы. Да, частенько нас запирают в небольших однотипных локациях, но стоит выйти на поверхность и ты видишь масштабность войны: монументальные постройки, сочетающие в себе средневековую архитиктуру с ретро футуризмом на фоне которых сражаются сотни людей с тысячами тварей. Такое впечатляет.

Это не новый жанр, но он является уникальным. С одной стороны это , с другой стороны . Однако, несмотря на простое жанровое обобщение, . Например, из Doom которые позволяют получить броню и здоровье и необходимы для выживания. Есть упрощенная для ближнего боя, которая также обеспечивает выживаемость в бою. Различные вариации от дальнего, до ближнего боя и комбинаций ближнего боя. Данный геймплей поначалу кажется нагруженным, но после часика игры ты понимаешь как в нем все просто и как все находится на своих местах без ненужных механик. Анимации добиваний сочнее и зрелищнее чем в doom. Море крови и хруста инопланетных тварей. Sweet Baby Inc курят в сторонке.


Музыкальная составляющая выполнена в стиле игры, но . Когда идешь крошить сотни и тысячи противников, хотелось бы это делать под выразительный саундтрек, чтобы аудиосоставляющая синхронизировалась с происходящим на экране. К сожалению, этого здесь нет. Даже в субтитрах не добавили какой-нибудь запоминающейся музыки, это печаль.

С ее духом пафоса и отчаянного безрассудства бесконечной войны всех со всеми. Сюжетно, игра привязана к первой части, но знание сюжета первой части необходимо лишь для понимания 1-2 твистов за весь сюжет, поэтому .

Что . Вот в этой игре финал сделан ФИНАЛОМ. Со всей эпичностью, эффектами и масштабностью среди которой игрок дошедший до финала использует весь свой арсенал и умения по максимуму. Выглядит зрелищно.

Также стоит кратко упомянуть, что Здесь , но обилие режимов более оправдывает ценник потраченный на игру. До сих пор бегаю в казалось бы простенький мультиплеер.

Для меня это пример тех игр, о которых я мечтал в нулевые , когда игровая индустрия только развивалась: зрелищный сочный геймплей, эпичность от количества противников, красивейшая графика и возможность проходить все это в кооперативе при желании. Ранее, я лишь представлял такое, играя в классические стратегии по Warhammer 40k, а сегодня, Saber Interactive подарили нам первую дорогую игру по этой огромной и старой франшизе. Определенно, для меня это .",2024/9/23,ru

By: decizion


Satisfying gunplay, good melee combat, great graphics.
The campaign is average and short but still well worth playing.
Co-op operations are fun but we need lot more of them.
PVP I personally don't care and will never play it.



Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a good game but there's not enough content atm.
The gameplay is good but it's sadly a bit repetitive after a while.
The operations are highly replayable, thanks to the different classes which are all fun to play but there is sadly not enough maps right now. I'm max rank with best weapons on Vanguard, Assault, Tactical and Sniper so there's not much left to do in the game for me now.

As it currently stands I must say that games like Darktide, Exoprimal, Earth Defense Force or Warframe for examples are way better survival/horde co-op games simply because they provide lot more replay value.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a worthy addition to your survival/horde/co-op games collection, Saber did a good job with this one and I'm very hyped to see what future content they have in store for us in the future.

Tipikusan egy egyszeri végigjátszásra elég kategóriáról beszélünk, ami egyébként jól sikerült, de semmi extra. A story röviden hogy keresztes hadjáratot alapítottak meg azzal a céllal hogy visszaszerezzék az elveszett világokat az ellenségeiktől.

Lényegében megyünk előre és daráljuk az ellenfeleket egy zárt pályán. Igazság szerint fa ék egyszerű a mechanika és emellett 6-8 óra alatt kijátszható. Ami piros pont hogy az egész kampányt 3 fős coop játékmódban is kilehet vinni. Illetve a story haladtával nyílnak meg úgynevezett operation küldetések, amik a fő story mellet történnek egy időben, amiből összesen 6 küldetés van. Lehet fejlődni, van skill ágazat, de a multirésze nem vonzott.

Grafika rendben van, környezeti elemek, részletek, az egész világ látványosra sikeredett. Hangzásokról pedig annyit tudnék írni hogy átlagos. Az optimalizációra fogjuk rá hogy jól sikerült. Ultra beállítások 1440p, rtx 3080, i7 9700k mellet 70-80 fps van átlagban.

Mint negatívumként eléggé cpu erős játék. A mai igényesebb játékok max grafikával a cpu max 50-55C körül mozog, viszont itt a 60-67C simán eléri. A hdr kihagyásáért kár, az epic kényszer telepítése pedig tragikus. Az ára pedig pénztárca függő hogy kinek ér meg ennyit egy 6-8 órás viszonylag lineáris kampány.

ArcticKingX,1,59.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArcticKingX/,"Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 – There is only war

Nachdem ich nun sämtliche Missionen des Spiels abgeschlossen habe und mich im PVP verprügeln lassen habe (ich habe aber auch gut ausgeteilt), werd ich erneut meine Eindrücke mit euch teilen.

Die Story

Planet Kadaku – ein verschlüsselter Notruf wird über einen Cogitator gesendet, Bedrohung – Tyranniden, Strategischer Wert auf Kadaku...Absolut. Die Nachricht wird ausgesendet und nahe Kräfte antworten. Ein Team von Astartes wird ausgesandt um sich der Bedrohung zu stellen...



Space Marine 2 ist ein Third-Person-Shooter, wo Ihr entweder allein oder in einem Team von 3, durch die Horden von Tyranniden durchschießt oder schlachtet. Als nun Leutnant Titus der Ultramarines wird die Geschichte um Ihn und Ihm herum weiter erzählt und setzt neben durchschlagskäftigen Boltern auch verschiedene Nahkampfwaffen wie Kampfmesser. Ähnlich wie im ersten Teil werdet Ihr von Horden der Tyranniden angegriffen, welche aber nicht nur als Horma/Termaganten auftreten (welche den Großteil des Schwarms ausmachen), sondern auch Tyranniden Krieger und oder andere gefährlichere Aliens auf Euch losgehen.

Der Nahkampf von Space Marine 2 wurde hier überarbeitet und es kommt sehr häufig zu Duellen zwischen euch und den größeren Tyranniden. Neben schnellen Schlägen, könnt Ihr starke Schläge austeilen, die euren Gegner betäuben können und euch so etwas mehr Luft zum atmen verschaffen. Sollte dies keine Option sein könnt Ihr auch rennen und Ausweichrollen einsetzen, um so Distanz aufzubauen oder euch aus einer umzingelten Situation befreien. Wer aber den Zweikampf sucht, so bietet euch das Spiel nun die Möglichkeit Attacken zu parieren und zu kontern, sodass Ihr euren Kontrahenten ebenfalls ins Schwitzen bringen könnt um Ihn am Ende seiner Lebensspanne genüsslich aus dem Leben zu treten.

Gespielt habe ich mit 2 Freunden auf dem höchsten Schwierigkeitsgrad und ich muss sagen, dass es deutlich schwerer war als der erste Teil. Kämpfe sind intensiver und man hat weniger Möglichkeiten sich zu heilen. Gerade der Nahkampf ist recht gewöhnungsbedürftig, da man recht schnell zerfetzt werden kann und das kontern echt gelernt sein muss.

Nach der Story bietet euch das Spiel eine Parallelstory, die ebenfalls in der Story sich abspielt aber nicht durch Titus`s Squad durchgeführt werden. In diesem PvE-Modus stehen euch nun 6 Klassen, wie der “einfache“ Tactical, Scharfschütze oder dem Bulwark zur Verfügung, die Ihr nach Euren Vorstellungen anpassen könnt und auch im Level aufsteigen. Im fortgeschrittenem Level habt Ihr die Möglichkeit Perks freizuschalten, welche dann mit Währung freigekauft werden müssen. So bieten sich verschiedenste Symbiosen unter den Klassen an, um so auch ein Alleinstellungsmerkmal für die Klassen zu generieren, nicht nur durch Ihre Bewaffnung.

Auch eure Waffen können etwas aufgewertet werden, welche Klassenübergreifend (Falls diese Klasse Zugriff hat) sind. Wie Ihr euch auch entscheidet, haben Sie entweder mehr Durchschlagskraft, mehr Munition oder sind einfach präziser.

Der PVP-Modus bietet derzeit 3 Spielmodi – Deathmatch, Capture the Flag und King of the Hill, alle teambasiert. Auch hier habt Ihr die 6 Klassen zur Verfügung und eure Astartes können optisch etwas angepasst werden, wobei die Chaos Astartes sehr stiefmütterlich behandelt werden derzeit. Die Modi liefen alle soweit sehr rund, nur finde ich das der Nahkampf etwas lasch erscheint, ich habe sehr häufig das Gefühl, dass ich keinen Schaden mache. Das kommt daher das der Gegner entweder schwer ins Wanken gebracht oder an dem schlechten Trefferfeedback. An sich kommt es dem Space Marine 1 PVP schon gut nahe und wir werden abwarten was noch so kommt.

Es ist Crossplay vorhanden, Ihr werdet auch mit euren Leuten Spielen können die das Spiel auf der Xbox oder Playstation spielen.

Ich bin auf einige kleine Bugs gestoßen, wie einige Grafik/Soundbugs. Hin und wieder konnte ich keine Eingaben machen, da musste ich des öfteren aus dem Spiel raus und rein Tabben. Ansonsten liefen die Server recht solide, hin und wieder kam es zu kleineren Störungen.



Gespielt wird mit Maus und Tastatur oder wahlweise Controller. Die Standardeinstellung der Tastatur war etwas fragwürdig, ist aber kein Problem da diese geändert werden kann. Es ließ sich sehr flüssig sowohl mit Maus+Tastatur spielen als auch mit dem Controller. Ich empfehle aber dennoch die regulären Eingabegeräte da man einfach präziser ist und ich denke auch schneller reagieren kann, ist aber Geschmackssache. Das Kontern muss hier definitiv gelernt werden, da das Zeitfenster echt knapp ist und das Timing stimmen muss.



Ein absoluter Ohr-gassmus, Überall wird geschossen, es explodiert was, Bolterfeuer, Kettenschwerter, stampfende Marines, der Ansturm von Tyranniden und dazu diese epische Orchester im Hintergrund. Es trifft Grim-dark genau ins schwarze und man hat nicht das Gefühl man schießt mit Erbsenkanonen….Außer das Astra Militarum natürlich...



Space Marine 2 hat einen sehr großen Sprung vom ersten Teil gemacht, sehr schön detailierte Grafiken, Tyranniden sehen super aus und vorallem unsere Astartes. Blut und Schlamm setzt sich an der Rüstung ab, im Hintergrund kommt eine Horde Tyranniden an und man stellt fest „Ohh ****, dass sind echte Gegner!“ die da auf einen zukommen und versuchen die Wände hochzuklettern und kein schön animierter Hintergrund um uns den Krieg so nah wie möglich zu bringen, man ist mitten drin.



Rosarote Brille ab, alles im allem Macht Space Marine 2 sehr viel richtig, ist aber sehr kurz. Nach ungefähr 18 Stunden haben wir bereits alle Missionen abgeschlossen und haben dann nur noch dieselben Missionen fürs aufleveln gespielt. Es gibt noch recht wenig Content fürs Geld wie ich finde und sage daher, dass man auf einen Rabatt warten sollte. Je länger Ihr wartet um so flüssiger läuft auch das Spiel im nachhinein, es muss noch etwas feintuning erleben. Eine Roadmap für kommenden Content ist vorhanden weshalb diese Review hier nur grundlegendes erläutern soll. Alles im allem empfehle ich uneingeschränkt weiter.",2024/9/8,de
A1SOR,1,77.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ALSOR/,"Выбил все ачивки и тезисно рассказываю о Space Marine 2

Ирония в том, что я терпеть не могу выбивать ачивменты, платины и вот это вот всё. Только в исключительных случаях, когда игровой процесс слишком уж нравится. Обычно я просто прохожу игру и даже не открываю список доступных достижений.

Но в этом случае что-то пошло не так. От игры просто не хотелось отрываться. Ну и я решил, что раз уж я завис в ней, то почему бы и не выбить всё, что в ней есть. Счастье, что всё, что по сути нужно делать, — это просто играть. Исключения — это несколько ачивок по сбору аудиологов и «убей нечто, пока оно что-то там делает». Но их немного, так что сильно отвлекаться от заруб не нужно было.

Ну и после такого, хочу кратко подытожить свой экспириенс.


Первое, что бросается в глаза при запуске игры, — картинка. В особенности — качественно проработанные задники и окружение. Технологически игра не предлагает что-то сверхъестественное. Чего не скажешь о величественной архитектуре и интерьерах, о брутальных баталиях, происходящих на фоне и о пристальном внимании к деталям. Художники отлично постарались, т. к. всё это задает необходимый настрой.


А именно настрой на непрекращающийся экшен, где в равных пропорциях замиксованы зрелищный слэшер с простой комбо-системой и неплохой шутер от третьего лица, что делает боевую систему SM2 в некотором роде оригинальной.









Уровни в PVE и в кампании не могут похвастаться комплексностью и разветвленностью. Однако, это никогда не имело для меня огромного значения в играх этого жанра. Самое главное, чтобы лвл-дизайн играл на руку основным системам и не мешал игре быть фановой. Так оно и работает в SM2. Максимум, куда можно повернуть с главной дороги — это за аудио-логами, да за парой ящиков боеприпасов и временных улучшений для брони. В остальном — игра не препятствует самого главному — бесконечной мясорубке. И это прекрасно.


На мое счастье, я проходил игру в дуо-коопе. И эта игра великолепно работает именно в этом режиме. Боты в игре невероятно тупы и на всё что они способны — это поднять упавшего тиммейта. И то не всегда. С точки зрения их боевой эффективности и пользы в выполнении совместных задач, здесь всё плохо. Так что мой вам совет — играйте хотя бы с одним другом, а в идеале в фул-стаке.

Невероятно примитивный, до смеха пафосный и если вы не являетесь фанатом вселенной, то это, вероятно, будет самым слабым аспектом для вас. Однако сказать, что он был полностью провальным — я тоже не могу: игра пытается в интриги, развитие персонажей и даже попытается удивить клиффхэнгером, который будет понятен только тем, кто играл в первую часть. В общем сюжет здесь — это чистая функция, являющаяся обоснованием для непрекращающейся мясорубке.

Отдельно хочу выделить решение разработчиков нарративно связать основной сюжет и PVE-операции. Пока Тит разбирается с самыми важными вещами, где-то на фоне другие ребята решают что-то второстепенное, что помогает основной команде. Получается интересное переплетение. При этом никто не запрещает пройти сначала PVE миссии, а потом сюжет. В какой-то степени это может даже повлиять на восприятие основной истории.",2024/11/28,ru
[★] NapoSky_* ☺,1,110.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/napoleon59w/,"Ce jeu est un banger tout azimuth.
D'avance : Oubliez les avis des streamers, oubliez les avis des casus qui s'attendent à avoir tout a portée de main sans rien faire. C'est ni le jeu pour, ni l'univers pour.
Si vous avez fait le premier Warhammer: Space Marine, un seul mot d'ordre : Foncez. Pour l'Empereur.

Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 est définitivement le digne successeur du précédent opus.
- Vous trouviez des lacunes graphiques au premier ? Balayé.
- Vous aviez l'impression d'être toujours tout seul dans un univers immense ? Oubliez.
- Vous avez fait le tour du premier en vous disant que c'était plutôt arcade avec une difficulté un peu claqué ? Oubliez également, Ici, on tryhard. Les tyrannides sont réellement nombreux, et les agents du chaos tapent lourd
- Vous êtes fan des vidéos fanmades Astartes ? Ici on monte encore d'un cran.

Un peu à l'image de DOOM Eternal, vous pourriez vous arrêter devant divers plans de combats au loin tellement le décor est dynamique. Aux premiers abords vous pouvez vous dire ""Haha, sur un millier de tyrannides j'en aurai que 10"". Non, pas de tromperies, vous allez réellement vous manger des hordes en temps et en heure.

A contrario des casus qui disent que la campagne est terminable en 6h (en jouant en easy et en rushant, évidemment). Comptez 10h pour tenter de la boucler en vétéran, et un peu plus de 20h en ange de la mort (soit ""Pas moins que le premier opus""). La difficulté est là, et la coopération est de mise. Vous êtes en perpétuel mouvement dans une invasion d'un vaisseau ruche qui est là pour vous éradiquer.

Les opérations viennent compléter le scénario puisque ce sont des missions d'escouades annexes aux missions de Titus, vous permettant de découvrir de nouveaux objectifs, et pour votre plus grand plaisir : de nouveaux boss.

Vous vous souvenez du lore du 1 ? Soyez prêts pour le scénario déployé par le 2.


Tout ça pour dire :
+ Définitivement un banger pour un studio AA
+ Le lore, le scénario, les cinématiques, les graphismes sont monstrueux
/ On pourrait couiner sur la linéarité, mais très clairement vu la qualité déployé avec 13 ans d'attente, c'est réellement un détail.

Nirhildija,1,11.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NrhildijaKogshu/,"Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine II Review
Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine II is the continuation of Space Marine I, where we will follow Titus as he faces off against the forces of evil that threaten the Imperium. The game uses a gameplay skeleton reminiscent of Gears of War but finds its identity thanks to some clever differences that encourage risky playstyles.

The game adds new elements and improvements to build upon its predecessor, while other elements remain the same such as story mode being a bit short and leaving players wanting more. Enemies now have multiple approaches to battle as they can swarm players, attack from a distance, or even inflict status such as slowing them down or corruption from chaos foes.

The main reason to get the game is to see the continuation of Space Marine I since it ends in a cliffhanger when it is getting good. The story is well done, illustrating the world of 40K similarly to the audiobooks but with visuals and interactive gameplay. Voice actors do a great job and there is mention of important figures in the lore along with some surprising appearances.



The game is hard in terms of difficulty, embracing a high-risk high-reward gameplay where one has to mow down obnoxious amounts of enemies while trying to survive and accomplish the objectives of the mission. The gore is satisfactory as executions are graphical and smooth, resulting in enemies popping up like toys on screen. These executions are also reinforced by the graphics and the fact that enemies that one sees in the distance can be attacked like they are real enemies rather than ambiance. Is always a show to see the Tyranids make their way to you from a distance.

The core gameplay is similar to Gears of Wars, you have dodges, melee attacks and range weapons. Where Space Marine II creates a distinction is that while Gears uses smart use of cover, this game lacks it, resulting in having to take high-risk maneuvers to succeed and parrying with great skill. As you take damage, you can recover HP if you inflict damage back, and executions restore armor and HP if you do them swiftly after taking damage. Thus, the game encourages a ""hit them harder than they hit you"" style where you keep the pressure on the enemy and the action never stops.



The Weapons such as the Power Sword are very fun to use, They feature a power mode and a speed mode making them versatile and useful against swarms, while abilities like the Jetpack give a lot of maneuverability and exploration options. All the weapons pack a punch and you can use what goes best with your playstyle, whether that be gun blazing, swords, chainsaw-swords, flamethrowers, or sniper rifles with lasers.

In my experience, I found the controller more comfortable than the mouse and keyboard (don't laugh at me!) but both options are solid. The reason for the controller is that the developers seem to have made an extra effort to make it more natural and easier to move around and parry enemies with it. ""But the aiming!"" my brother gamer, is a third-person action shooter, not an FPS, I rather have good movement than aim.

I played the camping solo and this is the part where I tell you the game has flaws. First of all, no matchmaking for the campaign, in 2024?! Seems like a mistake. Secondly, the bots are downright useless for the most part, they do not do objectives and they don't help a lot. The bots were so bad, that I had to lower the difficulty of the game, and this has been recognized by the developers who had stated they would tone down Veteran due to the incompetence of the bots. Other than that the game is very good and enjoyable. (I love my battle brothers but still fix the bots a bit).

A normal run of the campaign is around 8-12 hours depending on how good you are and what difficulty you choose. The game features a PvE mode and a PvP one giving it more shelf life in your library. Both modes are great, as PvE sees you tackling new missions through different perspectives while PvP has a couple of modes where you face off against other space marine players. They are both solid and add a foundation for future updates to the game.



Speaking of updates, the game will get a new Horde mode next year (cannot escape the comparisons to Gears of War heh?) which is great, because I believe in the long run what this game will need is an addictive fun mode like Horde, alongside with good PvP to keep it alive (and if we can get a DLC story down the great line, I am not looking forward to waiting another 13 years for Space Marine III haha!) With more updates and time, the game could easily next 50-100 hours of gameplay on the average player.

For 60 bucks I consider it a fair deal, you get a fantastic story in a quality game with great graphics, devs that will support the title moving forward with new content, and space marine action. I mean, nothing beats being a behemoth of destruction fighting for the Emperor while burning down your enemies to a cinder. The extra modes add more playtime and the personalization that you can do to your character post-game in the extra modes is sweet as you can choose from different chapters and personalize your space marine to your liking.

Space Marine II is a great game that despite having the opportunity to be an amazing title, gets held back by some limitations to the solo experience, a lack of matchmaking, and a short story. In due time, the game will become even better, and it is a short but sweet ride of a fantastic entry in the 40K universe. That being said, Saber Interactive, please don't make me wait another 13 years for the sequel to this game, and make the story mode a bit longer next time! If you enjoy Warhammer, get it. If you like 40K get it too. If you are into action games, consider getting it, but you can also wait until the title is injected with more quality-of-life updates and new content. The Emperor protects!

9.5 из 10 (Отлично)
Сюжет
Разворачивается в 42-м тысячелетии, в эпоху Тёмной Империи. После возвращения примарха Робаута Жиллимана человечество начинает новую кампанию по возвращению потерянных систем, известную как «Неодолимый крестовый поход».

Графика в игре Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 впечатляет своим уровнем детализации и проработкой окружения. Игра предлагает невероятно детализированные текстуры и модели персонажей, создавая ощущение погружения в мрачную атмосферу вселенной Warhammer 40,000. Полчища врагов и окружение оставляют многих игроков в благоговении перед масштабами и качеством графики.
1) Сюжет: продолжение истории главного героя, знаменитого космодесантника Тита из первой части Space Marine 2011 года.
2) Режимы игры: доступны PvE- и PvP-режимы, называемые «Операции» и «Вечная война» соответственно.
3) Кампания: кроме сюжетной кампании, игроки могут выполнять миссии в кооперативном режиме для трёх человек.
4) Прокачка персонажа: игроки могут улучшать своего героя, повышая его характеристики, навыки и открывая новые способности.
5) Кастомизация: игроки могут настраивать внешний вид своего героя, выбирая из множества доступных вариантов брони, шлемов и других элементов экипировки.
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 — это превосходный шутер, который порадует поклонников вселенной Warhammer и любителей напряжённых сражений. Игра предлагает захватывающий геймплей, впечатляющие битвы и атмосферу грандиозности. Графика и производительность находятся на высоком уровне, а мультиплеерный режим добавляет разнообразия. Фанатам серии и новичкам игра придётся по вкусу.
P.S. 1 — У игры большой потенциал для расширения контента с помощью cсюжетных DLC. Будем надеется, что разработчик реализует данные возможности.
P.S. 2 — Во время игры единственным техническим сбоем была застывшая заставка вступительного ролика в начале новой игры, однако после установки последнего драйвера NVIDIA проблема была решена, в остальном никаких технических проблем о которых писали другие рецензенты я не наблюдал.
P.S. 3 — Очень порадовало наличие полной русской озвучки.",2024/9/8,ru

SM2 at its best is another great addition to the highly loved horde shooter genre with a WH40K coat of paint on it, with my high love for WH40K it was a great journey to go through this game and be genuinely in awe over environment work and how being a space marine should truly feel.

For some this may not reach the expectations that they had been hoping for after such a long wait, for me i was satisfied with story and length. The COOP experience allowed for a lot more of a immersive time.

This is a genre of game that can always live on and with time if supported with their already shown roadmap, this will easily live up to being one of the best WH40K games next to the Dawn of War series.

За двадцать с небольшим часов, впечатления от игры исключительно положительные. Выглядит всё дорого-богато, полюбоваться есть чем. Стилистика вселенной воссоздана отлично, архитектуру и прочее окружение на локациях приятно рассматривать между мясорубками с противниками. Задние планы открытых уровней почти всегда динамичные, что добавляет масштабности происходящего, живости мира и ощущения планетарных боевых действий. Боевая система довольно не плохая, совмещающая в себе дальний и ближний бой. В наличии уворот, отскок, блок и парирование. Можно делать мясные красочные добивания, анимаций которых более 50 штук. Они зависят от вашего оружия, противника и его положения по отношению к вам. Противники порой напирают целыми кишащими ордами, как крысы в играх A Plague Tale, что выглядит эпично.
Совместно можно проходить как основной сюжет игры, так и отдельные боевые операции, которых на данный момент 6 штук. Они вплетены в основной сюжет, показывая некоторые события развивающиеся параллельно. На выбор четыре сложности и шесть классов бойцов с разными способностями, вооружением и живучестью. Кооператив кроссплатформенный и работает нормально.
Мультиплеер напоминает Gears of War, разве что за укрытие присесть нельзя. Пока всего несколько карт и три режима, два из которых это ""дезматч"" и ""захват и удержание"". Команды 6на6 с теми же 6ю классами бойцов. В команде может быть не более двух бойцов одного класса. Мультиплеер работает нормально, хотя бывают моменты, когда при подключении с сервера выкидывает, причем целиком всё лобби и поиск начинается заново, надеюсь починят. При том, что многие жалуются на техническое состояние игры, у меня сама игра вылетела за 20 часов всего раз и как ни странно просто при первом запуске, так что не считается.
Думаю разработчики могут гордиться своим творением, и игра станет достойной частью вселенной, где война идёт вечно. У них даже есть какие никакие планы на поддержку игры в будущем, что любопытно. Лично я требую добавления седьмого класса ""Апотекарий"" с возможностью подхиливать союзников и вырезать прогеноиды у павших товарищей.",2024/9/6,ru

칼가가 뭔데? 저글링같은애들이 침공한걸로 뭐저리 호들갑임?

바꿔말하면, 아는 사람들한테는 워해머뽕이 2배로 주입됩니다.
초반부 타이라니드 사태와 후반부 사태까지 그리고 스머프라 무시받던 울트라마린의 어쎔블 까지
각종 매체에서 무시받던 드레드노트 활약씬 등...
아는 사람한테는 거의 서비스 무한으로 넣어주는 차세대 글픽 노래방 같습니다.


그런거 빼고 보면, 이동 방호하면서 적 호드 썰기, 이동 의 반복입니다.
전투 자체가 지나갈수록 지루해집니다. 임팩트가 사라지는거죠. 기대했던 호드써는 시원함이
없고 불편한 타겟팅은 끈채 열심히 붕쯔붕쯔 해봅니다.
반격이 사기급이긴 한데 잡졸들한테는 잘 안먹힙니다. 오히려 보스전은 쉽습니다. 1대1이라

게임을 깻는데 기억에 남는 음악이 없습니다.
옆동네 다크타이드는 해병짜장 너글급 게임인데도
OST만 들으면 황제폐하 생각에 눈물이 찔금 나는것과 반대입니다
이 게임은 황제폐하를 보러 의무감에 가는 일요일 교회에서 부르는 찬송가 같습니다.


그리고 전체적으로 제가 느끼기에, 게임이 좀 가볍습니다
타이투스가 산책나가는 소녀처럼 폴짝폴짝 뜁니다.
패드에 진동 더 너어줘도 될텐데, 달릴때 쾅쾅쾅쾅 지축을 좀 울려도 될텐데..
하는 생각이 게임 시작부터 끝날때까지 듭니다.


타격감에 호평이 많던데, 저는 오히려 조금 아쉽습니다

PVE는 캠페인에서 타이투스의 명을 받고 다른 임무를 수행하러갔던 팀의 이야기라서 흥미로웠습니다
타이투스 팀이 우회로 할때 하이브타이런트를 잡으러 갔던 발리우스의 팀이 되는거죠
좋게는 캠페인을 개선된 AI와 또 하는 느낌이라 좋았습니다
단점은, 전장이 넓어서 협동보다는 개개인이 각자 바쁜 상황이 몇몇 연출되었다는 건데
이건 공방의 문제이니 그러려니 합니다.

Jokes aside, this game is everything the Warhammer 40k: Space Marine community has been hoping for. Not only does it serve as a solid sequel to the previous title, but it also sends a clear message to the gaming industry: players are craving shorter, simpler games that deliver high quality and polish. Here’s what it brings to the table:

Intense Combat: The seamless blend of gunplay and melee combat keeps the action dynamic and engaging throughout.

Visuals and Environment Design: The graphical upgrades and meticulous attention to detail provide an impressive visual experience.

Immersive Storyline: The game draws you into the dystopian Warhammer 40k universe with a mature narrative that revolves around epic battles.

Challenging Enemy Hordes: Facing off against the Tyranids adds an extra layer of difficulty, requiring constant movement and strategic thinking. And let's not forget the heretic traitors—on higher difficulty levels, they’re formidable opponents that force you to rethink your strategy.

Stunning Art Direction: It’s often overlooked, but the art direction in this game is phenomenal. From sprawling battlefield scenes to towering cathedrals, every building and wall feels like a piece of art. The combat may keep you too busy to notice, but when you get a moment to take it all in, it’s hard not to be impressed.

That said, there are a few caveats:

Potential Repetitiveness: Depending on your progression, the horde combat can start to feel repetitive.

Campaign Length: The campaign is fairly standard in length and varies with difficulty, but the narrative remains compelling throughout.

All in all, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 serves as a beacon for the industry, proving that you don’t need groundbreaking innovations to create a great game. Sometimes, a bit of refinement to an already solid formula is all it takes. That’s my take on the game—I hope this helps you decide whether it’s worth a playthrough! :)

FroheMilchmann,1,13.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037650969/,"UPD: So, I finished the campaign after almost 9h. Honestly, I feel like raising my score to a solid 9/10, it somehow kept getting better and more epic every hour. I haven't even touched the operations and PVP yet, but I'm ready for more gameplay, it was awesome. Could you find some nitpicks? Sure, I heard some people saying that it's too coop oriented, finishers don't give you health the same way as in the first game, etc, but I personally loved it. One of the best 40K games out there at this point.

EARLY REVIEW

I’ve gotta say - before I played it myself, I had a healthy dose of doubts and was just cautiously optimistic about this game, but man - it’s a blast so far! Considering the amount of epicness happening at all times, it is surprisingly well optimized and runs at very stable 60 with all high settings. The main thing that might bottleneck for some people is CPU, so you might wanna check that (thankfully I have no problems with it).

Gameplay-wise, it’s quite fun, more engaging and deeper than the first game, but it is more coop/online oriented (however, I have no issues playing it solo currently).

Story-wise - pretty much what you might expect from an action game based in the 40k. Nothing groundbreaking, but the tone is great, and characters are enjoyable.

Graphics, art, sound design - really impressed, you can feel the scale of big war, but at the same time there are little details everywhere that fans will surely appreciate. Guns and music are more meaty this time around, which I love.

Long story short - if you like solid, gripping action, and of course, the 40k universe, then it’s a must! GO SLAY SOME TYRANIDS FOR THE EMPEROR, BROTHER

장점
나 같은 광신도 워해머 빠돌이는 미쳐 죽어버릴 정도로 갓벽하게 잘 구현됨. 그냥 신 그자체임.
워해머 세계관 설정 분위기.. 스마의 힘과 성격 능력을 가장 잘 표현한 미쳐버린 게임.
캠페인 중간 중간 npc들 대화 내용이나 주위 환경부터 진행 할수록 몰입감 지리고 마치 내가 진짜 하나의 스마가 된 기분 느께게 해줌.
수 많은 적 무리의 물결 표현이 미쳤음. 적들이 다가올때 나즈막히 '와라.' 이 한마디가 육성으로 터질 정도로 전율적이다.
전투 처형 액션 지림 헤드셋 소리 크게 키우고 하는데 진짜 전쟁 한복판 총과 체인소드와 썬더해머의 폭발음 살이 터지고 찢기는 소리가 그냥 지림.
짧은 캠페인으로 염병 떨기엔 수명을 갈아 넣은 연출과 상남자라면 랄부를 부여잡게 만드는 미친 스토리에 지려버릴것이다. 병아리가 이 게임을 한다면 황제의 상징 쌍두 독수리로 성장할 테스토스테론 그 자체다.
슬라네쉬 같은 개ㅈ같은 추남 추녀 여장 남장 게이 비만돼지 트젠은 전혀 없고 오로지 전쟁터에 승리를 갈구하는 인류제국의 처절함과 게걸스러운 외계생물 그리고 역겨운 이단자들 뿐이다.
캠페인 끝나고도 할게 좀 많음. 그런데 심한 노가다도 아니다. 본인이 진정한 한 명의 아뎁투스 아르타르테스라는 가정하에 위험도 높은 미션을 돌면 금방 직업 무기 레벨 만렙 찍을 것이다.
최근 나온 게임 중 최적화 베스트인거 같음 프레임 드랍 렉 크래쉬 안나는거 얼마만이냐?

장점에 적은 좋은 점 제외 특출나는 건 없음.

워해머 40k 중 가장 잘 만든 게임. 언클린 원의 배변 같은 게임이 많았는데 왠일로 엄청난 걸작이 탄생했다.

-----마침내 황제께서 황금 옥좌에서 일어나 기적을 행했다고 밖에 볼 수 없다.------
이 말 한마디면 충분하겠지 형제들이여

젠취의 광신도 같이 분탕 치는 사람들이 말하길 스토리가 짧다 타격감이 구리다고 하는데 스토리가 메인이 아니며 스토리가 긴 게임은 오픈월드 게임을 하면 되고 타격감은 직접 해보면 완전 다른 느낌이다.
박진감 넘치는 전투와 타격감 살육의 쾌감이 이것보다 뛰어난 게임이 있을지 모르겠다.

분탕충 말은 안 들어도 된다. 그들은 완벽이란 없단 걸 알면서도 게임에서 완벽함을 찾는 불만 많은 안타까운 자들이다.
자기가 직접 듣고 보고 해보고 판단하라.

Runo,1,131.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Runo/,"TL;DR review:
This game is a solid action-shooter romp with fast-paced, exciting combat, an incredibly cinematic campaign, and a surprisingly deep customization and progression system to be found in its co-op and PvP game modes. It is well worth your money and if you're still on the fence, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't pick this entry up when it goes on sale.

Space Marine 2 is one of those rare cases where a game is made as an unabashed love letter to its predecessor, and in a surprise twist, it does more than match the original -- it surpasses it in almost every way.

This is particularly impressive if you consider that SM2 is the sequel to a cult classic title that was largely slept on when it was originally released. The original had all the makings of an outstanding game, but for as phenomenal as its gameplay was and as glowing as its reviews tended to be, it unfortunately neither sold well nor gained enough traction to popularize it after its release. It's also one of my favorite games of all time.

takes everything that made the original stand out and amplifies the oomph by a factor of wowza -- which is to say, it's a damned fine game, developed by a studio that not only understood their assignment -- to make a game worthy of being called a sequel -- they utterly aced all expectations. Without further ado, let's jump into what makes this game so good!

+ is not one of your dinky four hour Call of Duty campaigns with a plot as deep as the shallow end of a pool and the characterization of a pack of wild chimps -- it's a fully-featured, action-packed and highly-cinematic 10+ hour experience. I would almost compare the overall scope, scale and feel of the campaign as one very long Hollywood action movie. But like... you know, an actually good one.
+ SM2's 3-player cooperative PvE mode, expands upon the campaign story by introducing you to three out of a total of six fully-customizable classes in a slew of six exciting co-op missions with randomized spawns and emergent gameplay events (which only increase in number and variety as you scale the game's difficulty levels ever-higher). No two Ops missions play the same, as each one is a full-range map with unique objectives, the occasional MMO raid boss-worthy fight to spice things up, and LITERALLY hundreds (if not thousands) of xenos and heretics standing between you and glory.
+ I haven't had a chance to try out SM2's PvP mode, but my understanding is that it is stacked to similar degrees in terms of replayability when compared against its coop mode.
+ is deep and robust, allowing you to use any of the numerous provided Astartes chapters as a base (or, for the creative hands among us, recreate one of your favorites from beyond the breadth of the game's choices or even put together something homebrew). Each class has its own unique armor that can be customized to the umpteenth degree, ranging from swapping out one or both pauldrons, gauntlets, greaves and more or swapping in a different pattern for each individual armor piece, all of which can be painted just like the war games (and for the tabletoppers among us that just gasped in fright, don't worry -- you have to wait for the primer or paint to dry).
+ is, to be frank, so much deeper than I could have expected going in. Each class comes with a full 25-point perk tree, they all have their own selection of weapons that can be upgraded to perform better or even take on entirely different playstyles (for ranged weapons) or brand new combos and special attacks (for melee weapons), and ALL weapons have two perk trees, some with multiple choice picks to further assist the player in making their loadout truly feel uniquely them.
+ THE COMBAT. If you thought the original had fluid, frenetic combat -- and you SHOULD -- then SM2 is going to throw you through a loop. The good thing is that loop is violent, chaotic, a ton of fun, and greatly expanded upon compared to its predecessor; gone are the days of simply bashing, stomping and smacking your enemies into paste, as the game's melee combat has been completely reworked from ye olde button-smashing to a fully-developed system with blocking, dodging, and attack combos with light, heavy and special attacks. Melee combat at its roots is simple enough to be engaging and serviceable without alienating casual fans, while it is still deep and complex to reward highly-skilled and/or highly-dedicated players through the additions of of perfect dodges and perfect parries.
+ is engaging, as you proceed to tear through veritable roves of lesser enemies while brutally destroying more dangerous fare with visceral melee executions and gun strikes. Combat feels cinematic, it feels responsive, and you can really feel the sheer power and impact of each step, maneuver and strike from your futuristic super soldier of choice. And just as excitingly, the way the game centers around single-handedly demolishing hordes of foes in the high dozens makes any ground you gain feel hard-earned rather than easily-given.
+ The game fully immerses you in the iconic of the grim dark 40th century. I think one thing that even the game's harshest critics can agree on is that, from SM2's gothic-industrial soundtrack, to its crunchy, punchy and visceral visual and sound effects, and large, sweeping, absurdly-detailed grandiose set designs really come together to make you feel like one of the series' titular Space Marines dropped into the middle of all-out war.


- feel somewhat wonky and could use some attention, including outright absurd behavior when it comes to threat priority. This has resulted in mishaps such as grappling into entirely the wrong enemy (""no, no, I totally meant to dropkick that random traitor guard behind the Rubric marine, I swear""), or accidentally locking myself into a particular animation that I cannot cancel in times where I find myself seriously needing to dodge or parry.
- isn't distinct or obvious enough, especially from a distance. Sometimes I'll book it straight past gear and consumables that I didn't manage to spot in the chaos of combat.
- known as 'Blocking', is functionally useless compared to its two alternatives -- Balanced and Fencing. From my understanding the devs are aware of and in agreement with the belief that Blocking weapons need some serious love before they can contend with its cooler, better siblings.

Balgrim,1,53.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987710793/,"**Transcription vox d’un Space Marine après avoir expérimenté Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2**

Frères, écoutez mes paroles, car je viens de traverser une expérience qui pourrait presque égaler la gloire du champ de bataille réel. J'ai joué à un divertissement de l'Imperium, nommé **Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2**, et je dois dire qu'il est digne des plus grands héros de l’Adeptus Astartes.

Dès l’instant où j’ai pris en main le contrôle du Space Marine dans ce simulacre, j’ai senti une puissance familière, celle de notre armure énergétique, fidèle et lourde, chaque pas résonnant avec une intensité écrasante. Les développeurs de ce jeu ont capturé avec précision l'honneur et la terreur qui accompagnent le port d'une armure Mark VII. Le combat… ah, le combat, frères ! Chaque coup d’épée tronçonneuse vibre d’une vérité brutale, chaque tir de bolter frappe avec la force de l’Empereur Lui-même. Ils ont compris ce que cela signifie de mener une guerre sainte contre les xenos et les hérétiques.

Les ennemis que j'ai affrontés, ces détestables Tyranides, étaient nombreux et féroces. Leur carnage sans fin m’a rappelé les guerres sur Macragge. Le jeu capture parfaitement la frénésie de leurs assauts, te forçant à tenir ta ligne, à utiliser chaque bolt et chaque coup avec précision. Tu ressens l’urgence, l’obligation sacrée de protéger l'Imperium à tout prix. À aucun moment je ne me suis senti vulnérable, car comme dans la réalité, je savais que le devoir nous transcende. Mais la tension, frères… la tension était palpable, chaque bataille une épreuve de foi et d'acier.

Le visuel de ce jeu est une véritable ode à l’Imperium. Des citadelles imposantes, bordées de statues d'anges et de reliques sacrées, jusqu'aux vastes champs de bataille où le sang et la boue se mélangent… tout respire le 41e millénaire. Chaque détail semble béni par les Technoprêtres de Mars, une fidélité telle que l’on croirait marcher sur les propres mondes de l'Empereur.

Et la musique ! Frères, elle résonne comme les cantiques des chapelains avant la bataille. Elle t’emmène au-delà des limites de la chair, te poussant à te battre encore plus ardemment pour l’Humanité. Chaque note semble renforcée par la foi en notre saint Empereur-Dieu.

Je vous le dis sans hésitation : ce jeu est une bénédiction, une manière honorable pour ceux qui ne peuvent encore rejoindre nos rangs de comprendre ce que cela signifie d'être un Astartes. Que vous soyez aspirants, servants de l'Imperium, ou même simples citoyens, **Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2** vous donnera un aperçu de notre existence, de notre devoir sacré.

Frères, si vous avez du temps à consacrer en dehors du combat réel, alors jouez à ce jeu. Car il vous rappellera la gloire de notre mission, le poids de notre armure, et la grandeur de servir l'Empereur.

IronClad,0,17.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimIronClad/,"i dont think ive ever given a review to a game before but this game ends it today. im really torn on it because i can see all the hard work they have put into this game but it feels so empty. maybe my problem is that im playing solo, but this game is so boring. the game is beautiful and the storyline itself is great. the controls feel almost too simplistic, why couldnt we get a take cover button? the AI is so bad at helping during the campaign its like why even have them at all? they when they are on the jetpack missions they just fly and fall off the map or are never close to you unless you stand still for a minute. the jetpack controls are the worst thing ive ever used. the campaign levels are so empty, go here kill this group of mobs, then hold interact, and repeat over and over. i felt like i spent more time holding the interact button then i did playing the story. why can you just pick up ammo boxes with interact button but with grenades you have to hold down the button to collect them? all the medkits that are just trophy collections because they are clipped into the ground and cant be interacted with. the only collectibles ive found were datapads, and the invisible walls made it very empty and bland. i havent even tried PVE or PVP mode yet, but all of my complaints are purely campaign at this point. im sure the game is meant to be played with a party of 3, but im having a hard time wanting to finish this campaign because it just is so painful to play solo.",2024/9/10,en
tragic,1,565,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cureton/,"At the time of my review, I've done everything there is to do in PVE. I've gotten every class to 25, unlocked every perk, leveled every weapon to relic tier, unlocked every mastery point for each weapon, unlocked every heraldry, unlocked every cosmetic (through operations - 35 successful missions per class), and beat every operation on ruthless. Also beat the campaign, which I enjoyed.

The moment to moment gameplay is fun and rewarding as there is a skill element to maximizing your offense. Parry and Perfect dodge are great additions. All of the combat mechanics combined make grinding for unlocks in operations more of a fun journey than a chore, at least for me.

For those wondering about campaign length. It's approximately 7 hours give or take, and if you are on harder difficulties, you may find that to be longer. When you combine that with the Operations that tie into the story, that buffs it up to the 10-12 hour range.

Doing all the operations on ruthless difficulty (current max) and soloing them all was a really fun challenge, but it's not required.

EDIT: I've now played a ton of PVP (still ranking up) and I'm having a blast. At max Veterancy Level (25), I've played 100s of matches. The PVP is quite good, but it suffers from map variety. The balance is actually quite good, and there are plenty of strategies and counter strategies appearing as players get more experienced.

Overall, great game, I didn't run into any major issues, all of the classes are fun (and will be funner when a few small bugs are fixed). Emailed the devs and they mentioned a few of the bugs that I had submitted have already been addressed. I'll report back with my findings.

RE: Hours played: I was in both the preview and review periods of the game (which was about a month or so) which is why I have a considerable amount of hours. Not ALL of the hours were 100% playtime of course... things like setting up scenarios for videos, capturing footage, editing... but I would say I probably have at least 300+ hours of playtime in the game.

9月8日再评

如果看见我评论的朋友 你在9月9日前 如果你不是脑残粉 或是非常想要 或是就喜欢泰日天 或是蓝精灵团的话 我真的建议退款 别像我们一样


退出游戏后越想越不对劲 越来越不舒服 你说我是个纯粹的锤小白就算了 我也就不在意那么多了 问题我不是 我虽然不是棋子有钱大佬也不是什么翻译庭的神人 但是我至少从战争黎明1开始就喜欢上了这个题材 所以我对于一些本来按道理来说搬到游戏里的一些设定呢就会非常在意了 不多逼逼了 跟你们说道 说道

这里面的星际战士 是新款吧 对吧 原铸星际战士 他们应该更高大 更强壮 更迅捷 那么比起这游戏的1代他们除了画面上呢 你们觉得有啥变化？ 嗯 我觉得反而在这个游戏里 表现力还变弱了 泰日天原铸化后失去了""血神的祝福"" 不会处决回血了 变成可怜兮兮的回甲了 1代也有甲的 比这个耐打3倍 真的是三倍 而且甲的充能速度1代可能是这个的5倍速度 要快的多 是的这里面的新款星际战士脆如纸人 可以被2只刀虫近身后迅速被破甲 嗯是的 不是武士虫哦 是刀虫 而且只需要2只 那么游戏里你基本见到刀虫是多少呢 抱歉 我没去数 反正很多就是了 那么如果俩个武士虫呢？ 当然是你操作不挡直接扑街

好 然后我们的新款星际战士 力量方面呢 嗯 怎么说呢 我该拿那难度4的水准说吗 好吧 反正你没对面马格努斯家崽子的坏罐头厉害就是了 你上去砍半天都不一定能快速解决一个坏罐头 很可能被他反过来解决了 人家可以秒杀你哟 而且你不一定可以秒他哟

然后我们来看看多拉考尔给大家准备的军械武器如何？ 嗯 各种爆矢类武器几乎 难度4的情况下 可能除了那几个特化爆头的还勉强 剩下的全是废的 清杂不行 打精英目标更是可以把你笑抽了 你弹匣打完都不一定做掉2个以上的精英 甚至可能1个都做不掉 因为对方也在移动揍你 但是对面可能击发亵渎的灵能火焰弹几下就可以把你打成齑粉 这就是新武器么 怎么和我看的别人说的官方书上的差异那么大 我觉得还不如1代呢这些枪 甚至我觉得制作组是不是没看过战锤的武器设定？ 当我用热熔枪我就断定了 嗯 制作组只看了图片吧 热熔清理杂兵听那么一回事情的 然后备弹也很符合背景设定 那么实际威力除了清理杂兵其实它威力是最大的 嗯 但是啊 但是 你见过一个武士虫能吃下5发贴脸热熔么？ 嗯坏罐头可以吃7~9发······· 啊啊啊啊啊···笑崩了 对面都是人均大魔么 大魔有的也吃不住贴脸热熔啊··我的天

然后啊 热熔炸弹 嗯 这玩意威力挺好的 然后你拾取后只能带一颗 这些都不是问题 问题是 这玩意你只能原地放下来 然后引爆 是的 你作为一个新款星际战士 半神一样的存在 你连丢个热熔炸弹的力气都没有 可能这个热熔比刽子手背上的生物甲壳重吧~~反正处决时把背上的生物甲壳给单手撕飞了···我看不懂了 这些新的星际战士

然后呢 所谓的原铸装备模块化呢 嗯 在这游戏里变成职业了 是的 你没看错 变成职业了 按道理说 本该是 你有个角色 然后这个角色可以按照你所选的模块化装备来武装成特定的星际战士种类 而不是什么职业 制作组该去看看官方设定去 然后既然变成职业就导致很多武器反而不是模块化配置 变成固定了 比如啊 动力剑 你只有盾卫能用 匪夷所思吧 然后重型爆失步枪啊 只有所谓的战术星际战士能用 啊哈哈啊啊···我想说 制作组连GW官方的新版规则动画都不看的 动画里 10版利维坦大包宣传里 那个是先锋对吧 他手里拿的是什么武器 嗯？制作组 你敢告诉我吗？不知道啊？ 那明显是一把安装了喷火器的重型爆矢步枪~~~懂了吧 各位 也就说 制作组完全没发挥出 原铸星际战士模块化性能 游戏里的先锋是不能用这枪的 然后按道理通用的近战武器也被固定化了 我战术星际战士带个全套可以的吧 抱歉 不行 我盾卫就爱用战斗刀行不行 抱歉 不行····呵呵哒

天赋我就更不想说了 好几个鸡肋的 然后有些叠叠乐 嗯 在怪堆里 又脆 敌人精英一口气来个7~8个 偶尔在再来个特殊怪 还叠叠呢 搞笑呢

然后呢 游戏里有个物品圣物 你可以拾取 拿了以后你可以在倒地后起来 那么搞笑的事情来了 我们用的是原铸星际战士 对吧 那新款星际战士身体里加了个东西 那玩意叫做 贝利萨留炉
好的 实际游戏里 我们是没这个炉子的功能的 再一次的 制作组我想扇捏你们 你们读读书好不
看看规则也行啊~~~ 不知道什么是贝利萨留炉 我会在下面放入原铸星际战士的新三手术说明

然后继续吐槽 处决 完全不如1代 1代你可以通过近战武器造成敌人失恒后对目标进行处决 然后新的这个呢 嗯 这样这样说吧 1代你看见任何几乎所有敌人你都可以让它失衡 不论是原本在那的敌人还是之后刷新出来的敌人 你都可以 但是这个新的星际战士不行 比如小怪杂兵 你只可以失衡原本就在那个地方的 之后怪潮刷出来的杂兵一律不具备失衡条件 就是闪红光 可以处决了 刷出来的怪潮小怪 你最多只能击飞后出发一个枪击处决 而这个枪击处决是有可能被打断的 或是你在怪潮中央用反而得不偿失 接受后你没无敌帧的 但是敌人在你处决时候是一直揍你 运气不好直接要死了 而枪击处决最多给你回一格甲 我上面说了 你脆如纸 1格甲救不了你

也就是说 制作方这个就是个套皮的僵尸世界大战 如果看见我评论的朋友 你在9月9日前 如果你不是脑残粉 或是非常想要 或是就喜欢泰日天 或是蓝精灵团的话 我真的建议退款 然后下面附上原铸的手术三项

肌腱线圈：即使有着远超普通凡人的体质，一名普通星际战士在缺少动力甲和武器的情况下赤手空拳进行战斗仍然会有不小的风险。而肌腱线圈能大幅度增强一名原铸星际战士的体表肌肤和肌肉强度，一名未经改造的凡人在极端愤怒的情况下可能都无法打穿战车的金属外壳或是加固的混泥土墙，但是原铸星际战士可以在平常的状态下就能做到。除此以外，强化的肌肉和皮肤也能更好的保护他们体内的器官和植入物，尤其是与动力甲连接的黑色甲壳。

圣颂垂体：这个只有拇指指甲大小的叶状植入物将被植入大脑的核心部分。它最大的效果是增幅原铸星际战士体内已有的器官，特别是对骨骼和肌肉的强化，这也是为什么原铸星际战士的个头普遍高于普通星际战士的原因。值得一提的是，这个植入器官原本是帝皇本人设计出来用于制造原体的，考尔本人只保有植入右半脑的部分，至于关于左半脑部分的图纸早已无迹可寻。

贝利撒留熔炉：这个平时一直处于休眠的器官被称为“起死回生者”，它同时连接着两颗心脏。当原铸星际战士收到高强度的精神冲击或是创伤的时候，它会释放出类似于抗刺激剂的自制化学物质，这些化学物质也有助于创口再生和唤醒意识。激活一段时间后腺体会再次进入休眠状态，因为它需要时间来分泌和补充物质以便再次激活。包括原铸化后的极限战士战团长卡尔加在内的不少原铸星际战士都因为这个器官逃离了死神的魔爪。 作者：帝皇毒刃不屈要塞号 出处：bilibili














-------------------------------------------------------------------------以下的评论是9月6日的才开始玩的评论
总体玩了下来后 怎么说呢 一言难尽 只能说欧美游戏现在的制作水平是真的一般般了

本身一开始很期待 然后看了泄露版后更期待了 结果到了自己手里就不是那么一回事了

首先是EPIC的问题 我也安装了那个玩意 但是没被它什么不更新啊或是不会下载阻拦 然后小蓝熊默认给这个游戏先扣3分 第一小蓝熊没用 真想作弊的话这玩意很好绕 等于没有

接下来游戏内容 优化方面 一开始加载很慢然后进游戏第一段CG结果居然会卡 感觉还是加载的问题 反正我卡了半天 动画到了中间可能是游戏加载好了 然后就不卡了 进游戏开干的时候挺流畅的 没什么特别的问题

然后就是手感和一代差异性还是挺大的 首先你没处决回血 近战处决是无敌的 但是手枪处决会被打断 我反正被打断过了 然后联机有点不稳定 需要开加速器 近战的重击和轻击都是来自一个按键 对就是你鼠标 你快速轻按是轻击 安定了是重击 这就导致你近战有时候接洽上不够灵活 这点不如一代 而且没有区分俩着的改键选项 你只能去习惯这一点

然后还是处决的问题 就是手枪反击 也就是你躲过或是格挡成功 可以触发一次枪击反击 部分精英敌人可以被2次 然后杂兵基本上就是你格挡成功直接会进入处决秒掉直接 躲闪成功或是击飞可以获得一次枪击处决 但是这个枪击处决就尴尬在有时候 在什么时候很尴尬呢 就是你正在敌群中无双的时候 枪击处决必须等你的当前动作结束 才可以进行 并不像近战一样是可以强行停止动作来进入处决 这就导致比如你一个近战重击计费了敌人 敌人已经出现了枪击的处决的触发按钮 但是你按了没反应 因为动作还没结束 但是当你动作结束时 你可以能就偏移了位置 或是那个敌人超出范围 或是直接判定没能触发 然后从而导致你操作失误被怪围殴 毙命

也就是说 远程处决和你的动作接洽上有问题 如果能直接做成像近战一样可以立即中断当前动作进入处决 那么绝对会很爽 可惜没有


接下来就是联机模式部分 PVE 你没通关战役给你的图好像就只有一张能玩 总共就6个图 然后打了一局 反正经验少的可怜 就算最高难度也不会多少 然后武器和天赋方面 超级肝的 武器要材料 反正我打了一把 没见到就是了 对 不一定给你 然后0军团皮肤什么的大多数你可以通关通关获得的经验来解锁 但是精英装束就要通关特定要求了 比如通关次数啊这类的

总体而已就是可能除了画面和皮肤上的自定义以及武器的特性强化方面 其他都不如1代来的好玩 比如武器携带方面 我算上你的手枪也就3个武器 比1代还少一个 然后就是近战轻重击按键也是不如1代 1代是两个分开的按键 手感偏软反正 你看别人玩可能觉得很爽 但你自己上手 emmm就一言难尽

在此我只想说 9月9日还没到 打算9月9日玩的朋友 如果你不是锤粉 我的建议是退款 战锤40K类游戏 这款只能算是平庸之作吧 本以为是今年小黑马 但是看来不是 这游戏可以玩 但是不一定真的多好玩 只想过剧情的朋友 我建议是等打折 就这种体量水平的话 估计半年左右就会打折了 不用急着入 并不是太值得首发就买的游戏",2024/9/6,zh-cn
Brokeback Morgan,0,18,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Menua/,"I know I going to be on the unpopular side here, but I just want anyone thinking of buying the game to get the chance to see a review that tells it like it is.

I have never played a 40k game before, so without any passion or connection to the universe, I only can judge this game off of what it provides to me. This game is... not horrible, but it certainly isn't great either.

The campaign is short. Very short by today's standards. Like 6 hours, short. I finished in one sitting after work. Now, this isn't horrible, but it since the campaign is arguably the best part of the game, it being that short doesn't really bode well. Fun combat, great visuals, and an entertaining story... that you'll be done with at the end of the day.

Multiplayer is, well, not as great. The operations are interesting at best, monotonous at worst. You essentially get to play through a co-op mission of the campaign as the ""B-team"" that you would always order to go do stuff. It provides an interesting and new perspective, but is certainly nothing great. The ""endless"" war multiplayer, I.E the PvP, is fun for about, well, 2 days. Afterwards you realize you only have 3 game modes on 3 maps. It gets repetitive instantly.

Now I know what you're gonna say, ""oh but there will be updates, and look at the roadmap!"". My brother, you are paying $60 at least for a 6 hour campaign and lackluster multiplayer that you will get tired of in two days.",2024/9/7,en

Seortan,0,21.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992417260/,"На текущий момент:

На высоких уровнях игра превращается в Elden Ring: Бесконечные увороты и перекаты. Не сложно а просто не весело.

Болтерное оружие абсолютно бесполезное. Плазмаган бесполезен. Оружие ближнего боя в большей части бесполезно.

Мельтаган лучше всех остальных опций за счет большого урона и восстановления даже потерянного здоровья если у тебя есть хотя бы капелька белого.

Некоторые классы, например штурмовик, просто хуже других опций: Какой смысл от него если вангард делает все лучше него? Джетпак очень занерфлен.

Класс лок в операциях весьма дурацкое решение: Хочешь играть на высокой сложности? Качай 2 класса минимум иначе будешь стоять по 5 минут в гляделки с еще одним тактиком в отряде.

Баланс противников очень странный: Тзаангоры со щитами выдерживают ударом силовым кулаком в лицо. Простой воин нидов выдерживает 4 выстрела мельтагана в лицо. Враги очень точно стреляют и отказываются драться в ближнем бою даже вплотную, предпочитая пятиться и стрелять пока игроку приходится кувыркаться вперед поскольку у большинства оружия ближнего боя нет моментума вперед на атаках.

Геймплейный дизайн очень странный тоже: Какой смысл от ган страйка если окно неуязвимости такое маленькое? Какой смысл от него если самые простые тираниды снимают броню за 1 удар? Механика парирования классная но работает только в 1 на 1 или 2 на 1. Больше? Можно даже не пытаться. Плюс зачем вообще парировать когда увороты делают тоже самое только работают еще и на красные атаки которые нельзя спарировать?

ПВП это вообще тихий ужас: Вангард максимально сломанный класс. Крюк-> Стреляешь в упор из карабина и выигрываешь дуэль 1 на 1 с любым классом. Против булварка просто пятишься и делаешь крюк еще раз если он поднял щит. Большинство дальнобойного оружия имеет выше дпс чем оружие ближнего боя поэтому в упор лучше просто стрелять поскольку нет прерывания анимаций. Поэтому на текущий момент пвп это просто беготня и стрельба из карабинов в упор по большей части.

Кампания: В целом хорошо сделано но если играть на 3+ сложности то опять получается Elden Ring а не симулятор космодеса что портит ощущения. Боты абсолютно бесполезные и тупые поэтому на них можно даже не рассчитывать.

Кастомизация: В целом хорошо. Расцветки и возможность комбинировать цвета это весьма клево. Текущие куски брони на каждый класс выглядят хорошо но откровенно говоря мало. По сути самый последний тир косметики это просто 1-й тир обвешанный печатями и прочим. Средне в целом, хотелось бы больше.

Операции: В целом интересные. Но отсутствие директора иишки ощущается. Становятся сильно однообразными буквально на 4-й заход. Отсутствие специалистов и большего разнообразия элитных противников сказывается негативно на общем впечатлении. Плюс опять же, из за высокой сложности часто просто пробегаешь мимо противников до лифта/скрипта поскольку экономика здоровья и брони отсутствует на высоких сложностях операций. Если говорить про билды персонажей то тут все скудно. Никаких геймплейно изменяющих элементов в прокачке оружия и классов нет. Очень унылые ""5% больше урона"" или крайне редко что то в духе ""Получаете 1 полный магазин при низком уровне здоровья"".

В целом я разочарован тем как вышел СМ2. Им стоит сильно поработать над геймплейным дизайном и поведением противников и общим балансом. На текущий момент людям все нравится но данные проблемы очень сильно начнут бить по продолжительности жизни игры буквально через месяц после релиза если не делать изменения.",2024/9/10,ru

NixEmotions,0,20.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nixemo/,"I am quite impressed with this game both in terms of its gameplay and visuals after finishing the introduction. I'm excited to start playing the rest of the game in co-op with my sister. However, I cannot ever recommend a game that forcibly installs unnecessary Epic Games bloatware on your PC upon initial launch. I bought* a Steam game to play with other players on Steam only. (*Well actually, my lovely sister gifted me the game, but my statement remains otherwise the same. Thank you so much, sis! ^-^)

Fortunately, as long as you don't care about crossplay, the game is entirely functional without Epic Games Online and it can be easily removed from the installation. Here's how to do so.

1) Launch the game. The game will immediately attempt to install Epic Online Services. Cancel the installation box before it finishes. You will be met with an error message upon reaching the main menu. The EOS was never successfully installed, but remnants of the software are still on your machine.
2) Turn off crossplay in the game options menu of the game.
3) Close the game. Uninstall Epic Online Services from the list of programs on your computer.
4) Delete the Epic Online Services folder from the game's installation folder in your Steam library.
5) Reboot your computer and relaunch the game. The game will greet you with the error message when you reach the main menu whenever you start the game, but EOS will never again attempt to install itself on your machine. The game is fully functional without crossplay. Enjoy Space Marine 2!",2024/9/10,en

YuGo_Wolverino,1,13,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ydemonhunter/,"Prós:
+ A campanha, apesar de curta, é bem fod@.
+ As armaduras parecem realmente pesadas e isso reflete no combate. Você sente o peso na gameplay.
+ O combate é intenso, pesado e lento (no bom sentido) e por isso é quase que estratégico. O combate de Space Marine 2 lembra um pouco Gears of War e Darksiders 1. Uma pegada meio old school.
+ Horda de inimigos.
+ Modo COOP. Você pode jogar a campanha inteira em coop. Você + 2 amigos.
+ Excelente Direção de Arte. Os cenários são lindíssimos.
+ Bons gráficos.
+ Boa trilha sonora.
+ Esse jogo tem mais testosterona que todos os jogos da Ubisoft juntos.
+ A lacração da ""Games Workshop"" (empresa responsável pela franquia Warhammer e que hoje abraçou a cultura woke com força) não chegou em Space Marine 2, jogo desenvolvido pela Saber Interactive. Então Space Marine 2 RESPEITA a LORE da franquia.

Contras:
- Campanha curta. A campanha pode durar de 6~10h, dependendo da dificuldade e a forma como você joga.
- Os efeitos de sangue, quando você atira nos inimigos ou despedaça eles é muito cartoonesco. Podia ser um pouco mais realista. Mas isso é só questão de gosto pessoal mesmo. Mas o gore do jogo ainda é muito bom.
- Apesar de uma quantidade muito boa de horda de inimigos, eles tem poucas variações.
- O modo ""Operações"" (PVE) e ""Eternal War"" (PVP) são apenas repetições. Se quiser estender as horas de jogo você vai jogar esses modos até cansar. Para aqueles que, assim como eu, não se importam com o PVP, já é menos conteúdo ainda.
- Edições Gold e Ultra (são claramente conteúdos retirados do jogo base pra poder vender essas edições estúpidas por um preço exorbitante)
- Season Pass. E as Seasons que estão por vir. São mais conteúdos retirados do jogo base, afim de estender a vida útil do jogo.
- PASSE DE BATALHA em jogo SINGLEPLAY é de CAIR O CUH DO PALHAÇO!
- Pagar pra jogar antes. O famigerado Early Access (ou early unlock). Ubisoft e EA fazendo escola.

ArthurKong,1,86.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198816063713/,"Warhammer Space Marine 2, foi para mim o melhor jogo que joguei nos últimos anos. Não por ser um jogo que tenta ter um enredo complexo ou algo que tente atingir todos os públicos e acabe agradando ninguém. Esse jogo tenta e conseguiu se propor a ser simplesmente um jogo DIVERTIDO. Ele tem um modo companha, PvP e PvE e você vai se divertir com qualquer um deles.

A campanha é curta, mas não significa que é ruim, pois quantidade não é qualidade, poucos jogos conseguiram uma campanha longa e boa e são memoráveis até hoje. A campanha tem inicio, meio e fim, bem explicado e com personagens que vão te ensinar através de ações valores importantes para sua vida real, como honra, dever e sacrifício ( e para os mais religiosos a importância da fé em seu mestre/salvador). A campanha tem uma dificuldade natural, de você não conseguir porém você quer continuar.

Não joguei muito o PvP só o suficiente para pegar as conquistas, porém me diverti bastante o PvP é desbalanceado so que a graça é que não é pay to win, todo mundo tem acesso aos mesmos armamentos, classes e etc. Mapas bem construídos e fáceis de memorizar e jogar.

O PvE é um show a parte com operações que tem co-relação com a campanha, boss fights muito desafiadoras, níveis de dificuldades bem balanceados e distintos, cada classe que você escolher tem uma build de aramas e habilidades com estilo de gameplay completamente distintos.

O que me surpreendeu nesse jogo foi a relação da comunidade com os desenvolvedores onde, tudo está sendo resolvido da forma mais rápida e justa possível sem fan service ou algo do tipo.

Space marine 2 é uma perola do AAA, para quem tava descrente com o mercado de jogos, esse game é a solução. conheci o universo warhammer por causa dele, fiz novos amigos e depois de muito tempo afasto de jogos multiplayer encontrei um onde é saudável investir meu tempo.

The combat is good but can be a bit janky, especially the melee combat. the control scheme isn't great for mouse & keyboard and was obviously designed with console controllers in mind.

RayNero,1,22.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raynero/,"讓戰鎚粉絲滿意的表現，一般玩家建議等個折扣

前言：
時隔13年，原名為《戰鎚：殺無雙》的星際戰士一代終於迎來了續作，續作不僅換了開發商也換了發行商，基本可以當作是一款新作品了，這次是由曾開發了《War World Z》的團隊來製作，因此有許多WWZ的玩法影子，不過前作的「處決」特色有被保留下來；遊戲的戰役精彩但是流程偏短，多人模式則有伺服器不穩、內容過少而要重複刷的問題，使得現有的遊戲內容會讓部分玩家覺得不是很符合定價，但如果你是帝皇狂熱的僕人，現在正是獻上忠誠的時候！




遊戲的故事延續一代，極限戰士主角泰圖斯雖然力抗歐克、混沌，最後仍因為被指控與混沌有染而被送往審判庭的結尾，二代的故事開頭我們會得知泰圖斯被編列入專門對付泰倫蟲族的「死亡守望」戰團中，歷經於蟲族百年戰鬥後，在一次任務中泰圖斯身負重傷，被原戰團「極限戰士」所救，為拯救他性命，戰團將他改造成更為強大的「原鑄星際戰士」，並讓他得以重返戰團擔任副官，審判庭要求他繼續對抗蟲族以證明自己終於人類、帝皇，而不是混沌異端。

二代故事發展緊湊，敘事流暢，完整的展現出了「硬派男子漢」的戰鎚風格，單人戰役中我們扮演泰圖斯帶領新的極限戰士小隊執行各種任務來阻止蟲族與混沌勢力，而在PVE任務中則會以另一個小隊的視角來幫助泰圖斯完成任務，補強戰役裡沒提到的劇情，不過單人戰役中幾乎完全沒有養成元素，讓戰役過程中缺少成長感與變化性，讓戰役有點像是為多人模式準備的教學，整個流程比較短，大概就7～8小時的長度，算起來跟一代差不多，略微可惜了。






不論是主線戰鬥還是PVE的模式，玩家都能享受本作爽快的戰鬥打擊感，使用各種戰鎚世界觀裡的武器，像是「動力劍」、「熱熔槍」等等來痛宰泰倫蟲族，不過嚴格來說本作算不上無雙遊戲，戰鬥中在各種蟲族圍攻擊下很快就會耗盡角色的護甲與血量（一點都不星際戰士），護甲可隨時間恢復，血量則是要趁白底時殺敵回血，變黑底就只能打針補了，因此我們需要利用戰鬥機制來和敵人進行一定的「對招」。

蟲族小兵幾乎不太會對玩家造成影響，戰場上可以專心對付各種的菁英頭目，敵人攻擊時完美格檔、閃躲就能進行「槍襲」反擊，這招會給敵人大量傷害，重複一兩次敵人便會露出破綻，這時我們可以進行「處決」來立即恢復護甲，這次處決過程不同於一代，有無敵的狀態還可中距離觸發，過程中會擊殺周遭的敵人小兵，戰鬥盡量處決就對了！

剛開始打起來可能會覺得不夠爽快，但掌握和敵人互動的方式後就簡單許多，但也因為這樣，幾乎所有的戰鬥都會在「防禦→槍襲→處決」的流程中進行，使得戰鬥的變化會變得有些重複，不論什麼情況、職業都離不開「處決」。






遊戲的PVE模式中我們可以從六種星際戰士職業選擇一種來進行關卡，每種職業有固定能使用的裝備，以及獨有技能樹，每一種武器會隨著殺敵數量獲得經驗來進階，關卡內收集到的武器資料可以讓槍枝變熟練而獲得槍枝技能點數，目前的職業強度有點不平衡，同時每個職業的升級進度是完全獨立的，導致玩家換新職業基本就是要重頭練起，重複度會比較高。

而作為PVE使用的關卡設計目的為補強主線的支線，因此關卡內有著很固定的流程，雖然出場的菁英頭目是隨機的，但整體變化並不大，不向是其他服務類型的遊戲，會有地圖隨機性+任務隨機性的組合，所以對比之下在刷關卡的重複感會比其他遊戲來得更快、更容易膩，整體而言還是關卡數量不足所導致。

但如同其他的戰鎚IP遊戲，本作一樣有相當豐富的可自定義內容，盔甲上能有各種烙印、符文與徽章，還有來自帝國9大軍團、戰團，甚至也有混沌星際戰士派系的各種裝飾與造型可以收集，不過想收集滿這些裝飾，將有相當冗長的刷關過程，可說是為粉絲打造，目前多人遊戲中的一個主要誘因跟追求目標。





✊ 出色的畫面表現，壯觀史詩的戰鬥場景
✊ 精彩、緊湊的劇情，延續一代的故事
✊ 爽快度十足的戰鬥，噴血爆漿的各種處決
✊ 帥氣十足的裝甲造型、外觀

💤 單人戰役流程偏短，特定場景有優化問題
💤 合作PVE模式關卡少、流程固定，容易刷膩
💤 伺服器連線糟糕，爆PING，還會回溯！
💤 職業跟武器的平衡性不足





遊戲目前有些優化以及伺服器連線破爛的問題，以及對比同樣是戰鎚IP的服務型遊戲，像是《鼠疫》系列或比較新的《黑潮》，本作的多人內容尚不夠充足，發售一個月熱潮過後，可能遊玩人數就會大幅下降，這只能等官方更新後面更多關於多人模式的關卡數量了，以目前版本的內容來說，戰鎚粉有濾鏡的情況能玩的很滿足，非粉絲又只完單人的話CP值稍微不夠，容易放大現有問題，所以會建議非粉絲的玩家可以等一點折扣後再來入手。

遊戲首次開啟會被強制安裝 EPIC ONLINE SERIVERS 的軟體，這是為了讓不同平台的用戶能跨平台連線的功能，但是因為遊戲商店沒有標示要安裝此軟體，故被不少人噴了一輪，官方似乎是寫在 EULA 的協議裡，如真的很在意，網路上有不少教玩家如何停用EOS的方式，只要沒跨平台連線需求，這是一個可以完全不裝的軟體，如果還是有疑慮的話……",2024/9/15,ko

-----------------------------------
Addendum to original submission, due to outrage from Inquisitorial conclave.
-----------------------------------
Let us review the game as a whole (newest update included):
Story:
Excellent, although it seems that some footage from several servo-skulls went missing.
Low initial mission count, supplemented by same number of operations (meant for multiplayer)
Score: 6/10

Visuals:
Relay congratulations to the Artists, Remeberancers and the Tech-Priests.
Score: 10/10

Lore:
As it should be. Personal note: Not sure why a race such as the *Redacted* would have a device that actively empowers warp rifts.
Score: 9/10

Connectivity:
Needs polish. It seems sudden and unpredictable Warp-storms are causing havoc with the Astropathic choir. Sometimes the Astronomican is barely visible.
Battle-Brothers are losing connection and are unable to join their squads, which is endangering mission continuity.
Score: 5/10

Multiplayer:
PvE element fun and satisfying. With several inconsistencies which currently appear to been worked on.
Score: 6/10

PvP element. Found an archeo-tech note which reads ""Not Great, Not Terrible""
Score: *Redacted*

Customization for Space Marines:
It would seem that members of *Redacted* have stolen most other Space Marine Chapters actual Gear.
For now it seems that the Tech-Priests are repainting Ultramarine's armor and presenting it as other Chapters armor. Level of heresy is high, but acceptable until actual armor pieces are found.
Score: 4/10

Summation: Game is good and developers should be praised for what they have created.
With enough polish and additional work it would be an Excellent game. However there are several questionable decisions on release which probably are related to business decisions for content which require to be further scrutinized.
Final score 6.5/10
Original recommendation: Yes

Post-Update Review
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is my take on the current situation of the game:
- New Level - Very Good
Level design is great, new Bio-Titan is Awesome

- New Difficulty - Report to the Inquisition -
New Enraged status for Majoris is good;

Cohesion ""Leash"" - bordering on Heresy- Snipers, Heavies, Vanguards and especially Assault are getting penalized for their play style. The first too are supposed to be in the back providing fire support, the other two are supposed to be in the tick of it. -
Recommendation: Rethink the design, perhaps based on what classes do best and how they can compliment each other. Positive reinforcement is better than negative.
Examples:
Knife in the Dark -

When the Sniper and the Vanguard are in Proximity range knife damage and/or speed and/or cleaving is increased

Overlapping fields of Fire -
When the Heavy and the Tactical are in close proximity, bolt weapons damage is increased for both Marines.

There! That one! -
When the Tactical and the Sniper are in close proximity Sniper Riles deals significantly more damage to Auxpex Scanned enemies

Thunder and Fury -
When the Assault and Bulwark are in close proximity power weapons deal more damage and/or have increased attack speed

Fangs of Fenris -
When two Marines are in close proximity Chain weapons have increased cleave and/or damage

Shield against the Filth -
When the heavy and the Bulwark are in close proximity the The Iron Halo becomes a sphere and has increased ranged

Downtime after death - High Heresy -
Recommendation: For an action pack game where every second counts 120 seconds should be the absolute maximum no matter what new difficulty is introduced.


Balance changes - High Heresy -
Armor changes - Seems good.
Ammo changes - Seems good.
Recommendation: Reconsider some nerfs except the Tactical's scanner, buff the under-performing weapons instead.

Report submitted to Chief Interrogator.
Until the Heresy Levels are lowered recommendation for the game is a NO.

Pre-launch the company promised to release patch notes before they went live to receive feedback and they haven't done this a single time.

This trend of corporatocracy needs to stop. I shouldnt need 3 accounts (steam, epic, saber) with 6 EULAs (steam account, epic account, saber account, in-game EULA, steam purchase EULA, epic service EULA, and maybe more that I forgot) just to have my consumer rights degraded. Forced arbitration, not actually owning the media you buy, and having to run what surmounts to spyware even for single player, battlepasses and predatory monetization everywhere. None of this should be normalized. This game is fun but I can not recommend this game to my friends as I am tired of supporting this regime of predation. And before any commenters say this is hyperbolic or developer PR adds the technical excuses, just remember, games were fun and sold well for the last few decades without all this BS. We live in a golden age of media yet insist on tarnishing it.

P.S. An extra $30 and I still have to grind just to paint my guy purple?! No, thanks. Yes, I know you can run without EGS, but it still installs EGS dependencies.

McGregor,1,478.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199753875974/,"A fantastic game bringing back all the memories of couch co-op from the early aughts. With lavish attention to detail and lore accuracy, Space Marine 2 sets a new bar for the Warhammer franchise.

Combat captures all the crunchy melee and weighty ranged weapon feel you'd expect from the 41st millennium. While feeling clunky at first, the gameplay soon becomes a fluid dance as you begin to understand the parry, dodge and gun strike mechanics culminating in a wide array of gory executions. Harder difficulties will provide challenge and invoke some truly triumphant moments for your three man squad.

The campaign is a relatively linear but satisfying romp with some great set pieces and characters that provide a basic depth making completion satisfying.

Operations, where you will likely spend most of your time, has only 6 missions (for now) but the great combat loop and AI director keep you engaged long after multiple replays should begin to feel stale.

6v6 multiplayer has a solid foundation with well designed maps and a decent paper-rock-scissors class system.

Shinzu_Rh€iya,1,34.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AekiEj/,"Ah, mes petits enfants du Warp, installez-vous bien, car je vais vous faire une évaluation bien juteuse de Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 ! Vous allez voir, c'est une tornade de bagarre, de violence galactique, et de chaos spatial qui va vous décalquer les neurones comme une hache tronçonneuse dans le crâne d'un Ork. Allez, c'est parti, et on commence par les gros morceaux bien croustillants, puis on ira vers les détails un peu plus… piquants.

Les points positifs !

Une immersion brute, violente et épique
Vous entrez dans la peau d’un Space Marine, un vrai, un dur, un Ultramarine avec des pecs de la taille d'un tank et un amour profond pour le carnage méthodique ! L'atmosphère du jeu, c'est du Warhammer 40K pur jus. Vous n'avez même pas besoin de connaître l'univers pour vous laisser emporter par la rage qui suinte de chaque pixel. Les combats sont nerveux, les ennemis volent en morceaux, c’est une véritable danse de la destruction orchestrée à la perfection.

Un système de combat jouissif
Mais bon sang de Terre, qu'est-ce que c'est bon de taper ! La mêlée est d’une satisfaction totale, avec des animations qui sentent le poids, la brutalité, et ce petit « sploutch » bien gras quand votre marteau tonnerre vient se poser délicatement sur un Tyranide. Les armes de tir ? Des œuvres d’art en mouvement ! Le Bolter claque comme un canon de tank, chaque balle semble avoir un impact titanesque, et on sent bien le poids du matos. Vous êtes là pour décimer, et ça se ressent à chaque coup.

La horde tyranide : un cauchemar vivant !
Ah, les Tyranides, ces créatures dégueulasses et innombrables ! Les vagues d’ennemis qui déferlent, c’est un pur régal pour les amateurs de massacre en masse. Et là, mes bons amis, on en prend plein la figure : ils sont rapides, ils sont nombreux, et ils n’ont qu’un seul but, vous dévorer. Ça donne une intensité incroyable aux combats, car chaque seconde est un défi de survie où vous devez littéralement vous frayer un chemin à coups de Bolter et de tronçonneuse pour ne pas finir en repas de festin.

Graphismes et mise en scène à couper le souffle
On est sur du haut niveau. Les décors sont grandioses, colossaux, totalement à l’échelle de l’univers de Warhammer 40K. Les cités forteresses, les planètes dévastées, tout est détaillé, tout est majestueux, et la mise en scène vous balance directement au cœur de cette guerre infinie. Le travail sur la lumière et les textures ? Un régal visuel pour un jeu de cette envergure.

Un mode coop qui promet de belles heures de franche rigolade
Parce que oui, jouer en solo, c’est bien, mais alors fracasser du Xeno avec des potes, c’est encore mieux ! Imaginez-vous, trois Space Marines, chacun armé jusqu'aux dents, avec des stratégies bien primaire du genre « On fonce dans le tas et on verra bien après ». C’est de la coop à l'ancienne, honnête, comme on l'aime, avec de grosses sessions de déglingue entre amis.

Les points négatifs !

Une répétitivité qui peut poindre à l’horizon
Oui mes p’tits nobles du Warp, à force de massacrer des vagues incessantes de Tyranides, on peut avoir cette petite impression de « déjà-vu ». L'action, aussi intense soit-elle, finit par se répéter au bout d’un certain temps. Ce n’est pas un gros souci si vous êtes un bourrin dans l’âme comme moi, mais ceux qui cherchent de la variété pourraient trouver l'expérience un brin linéaire sur le long terme.

Pas assez d’ennemis variés pour l’instant
On adore les Tyranides, hein, c’est clair. Mais qu’est-ce qu’ils sont nombreux. Peut-être qu’un peu plus de diversité dans les hordes ennemies aurait été le bienvenu. On se retrouve souvent à poutrer les mêmes types de créatures, sans avoir l’occasion de changer de méthode ou d’approche. Peut-être qu’avec des DLC ou des mises à jour, on verra plus de saloperies mutantes, mais pour l’instant, c’est une armée de bestioles ressemblantes qui vous déferle dessus.

Narration secondaire un peu en retrait
Bon, on ne joue pas à Space Marine 2 pour son intrigue Shakespearienne, on est bien d’accord, mais l’histoire est tout de même un peu en arrière-plan. Elle ne vous accroche pas particulièrement, elle sert surtout de prétexte à aller fracasser du Xenos. Si vous aimez les grandes épopées narratives profondes et chargées d’émotion, vous resterez un peu sur votre faim.

L’absence (pour l’instant) d’un multi compétitif
Là, on aurait aimé avoir un peu plus de sauce, un mode PvP avec des batailles épiques entre Space Marines, ça aurait été un pur régal ! Mais à l’heure actuelle, le jeu se concentre surtout sur la coopération, ce qui est déjà énorme. Cependant, on espère que les futurs ajouts viendront combler ce petit manque et offrir des batailles épiques contre d'autres joueurs.

Conclusion
Alors, qu’est-ce qu’on en pense au final de ce Space Marine 2 ?! Eh bien, c’est une claque monumentale, une boucherie galactique à laquelle il est impossible de résister si vous aimez les combats intenses, l’univers Warhammer 40K et que vous avez toujours rêvé de jouer un Ultramarine avec un Bolter dans une main et une tronçonneuse dans l’autre. Oui, il y a des petites imperfections, mais on les pardonne aisément face à l’intensité du fun pur qui vous attend.

En résumé, c’est de la puissance brute, c’est épique, c’est grandiose. Et quand vous plongerez dans le feu de la bataille, rappelez-vous toujours : ""A L'ASSAUUUUUT ! POUR L'EMPEREUUUUR !"".",2024/11/7,fr

1.人物极其脆弱，护盾跟纸糊的一样，满级后去最简单难度练武器，被一群近战小怪掺杂着武士虫外带远程怪打得鸡飞狗跳。远程怪几乎弹无虚发，然后时不时还在我身后的视野外刷怪，直接屏幕外蹿进来给我来个惊喜。套用贾队长的话就是说“我1级被这些小怪配合起来虐，25级还是被它们虐，那TM我不是白升级了吗？”
2.武器极不平衡，高难度热熔几乎是必选项，近战武器冒着被围殴致死的危险结果一顿输出不如热熔来一发，要么就是盾卫站着跟王八一样边防御边等格挡，问题是配合盾卫的职业设定这样的玩法也可以理解，那突击呢？我希望你们能做好武器间的平衡，但是注意不是无脑削弱热熔，而是加强其它武器。游戏里的武器设计出来必定会有少数不受玩家待见，但是当绝大多数武器玩家都不想去碰的时候，那设计这些东西出来有什么意义？
3.枪袭的判定极其诡异，时近时远，有时候可以枪袭时贴脸也放不出来，有时候隔着几个身位莫名其妙给你来一个，而且枪袭过程中没有无敌判定，曾经在暴君的多段攻击里格挡了第一下攻击，但在枪袭动画中被第二段攻击打死了。这个系统设计出来你们肯定是想鼓励玩家用的，但是在使用过程中暴毙了那意义何在？
4.我用手柄的，标题画面不小心误按了“新游戏”选项，然后进入了新游戏一些游戏设置的画面，但我想回到标题画面却根本找不到选项，ESC也没用，我不清楚现在的更新有没有修正这个问题，当时担心会覆盖存档我就ALT+F4关闭了游戏，然后奇葩的来了，再进入游戏发现之前战役进度全没了，全部要重新打，这不搞笑吗。
5.练武器极其无聊，主要原因还是上面说的武器设计不平衡，加上怪群超模的组合以及自身没有拿着低等武器去高难度当吸血鬼的无赖品质导致了整个过程极其煎熬。如果你们不想平衡武器的话，那就加入一个武器满级后可以储存多余经验的槽，让我可以把满级后获取的多余经验分配给其它弱鸡武器。
6.我不清楚刷怪是什么样的触发机制，有时候在没有怪物增援的情况下，当前区域会刷出非常多波次的怪，然后下一个战斗区域几乎就没怪了，真就怀疑是不是看我们打得兴起然后即兴把下个区域的怪提前生成给我们了？
7.锁定这个功能我不知道哪个天才做的，锁定单体怪以后怪不仅不在你的视野中心，反而视角会自己乱转，你们没Dev-tester的吗?",2024/9/13,zh-cn

К счастью, создатели Space Marine 2 сделали всё, чтобы порадовать поклонников вселенной и оригинального экшена. Сиквел стал заметно больше, лучше и величественнее. Хотя в его основании лежит знакомый фундамент, заложенный авторами оригинала.

Возвращение легенды:
С событий первой Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine прошёл целый век. Деметриан Тит, некогда капитан космодесантников, всё это время находился в опале. Но после очередного задания его возвращают в ряды ультрамаринов. И, надо сказать, этому мало кто рад. Прежде всего, новые братья Тита, которые с подозрением и даже высокомерием относятся к «новичку-ветерану». И хотя главным героем движет Долг, игрок видит, как Тит под всей своей мужественностью устаёт от происходящего…
История Space Marine 2 проста и прямолинейна, как движение меча космодесантника к шее тиранида. Силы Империума Человечества вновь подверглись нападению, и только Тит и его братья по оружию могут спасти простых людей и далекие планеты от масштабной угрозы.
Конечно, если копнуть чуть глубже, перед нами не просто очередная борьба добра со злом. Двигаясь по сюжету, игрок понимает, что на важных планетах скрывается нечто куда более ценное, нежели ему сообщает руководство. И цели у охотников за чем-то столь желанным далеко не так очевидны.
Порой при прохождении экшена ты можешь ловить себя на мысли, что местами лейтенант Тит словно движется по сюжетным рельсам оригинала. К счастью, Saber сворачивает в сторону ровно тогда, когда нужно, не следуя Кодексу Relic Entertainment. Это не делает сюжет особенно глубоким. Но следить за развитием отношений Тита и его новых братьев — Гадриэля (он же Галадриэль) и Кайрона — интересно на протяжении всего пути.
Проходить Space Marine 2 без проблем смогут и те, кто не знает о событиях первой части. В случае чего, персонажи всё объяснят и разжуют. Но если вы из тех, кто полюбил первую Space Marine… Ваши эмоции будут куда более яркими!
Действие новинки разворачивается на трёх планетах. И во время прохождения герои побывают среди болот и джунглей, и в подземных туннелях, и среди величественных строений, и на местах крупных сражений. Порой, смотря по сторонам, вы будете замирать от восторга! При этом, думая о масштабе всего и вся, разработчики не забывали и о мельчайших деталях окружения.
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 выглядит и звучит прекрасно. Да, во время прохождения вы то и дело будете видеть определённые графические недостатки: например, на наших глазах в тех или иных местах прогружаются текстуры. Но такие исключения лишь подтверждают правило.
Глаз радуется даже тогда, когда должен предупреждать мозг: скоро будет больно. Когда на тебя со всех сторон бегут и летят всевозможные твари, ты можешь не спешить доставать пушку. Потратив на них пару обойм и заметив себя в окружении врагов, всё равно тихо радуешься. Потому что красиво. Ужасно, конечно, и скоро будет очень больно, но всё равно красиво!

Классический геймплей в новой упаковке:
Игровой процесс Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 покажется родным каждому, кто прошёл первую часть. С небольшими нюансами. Обрисуем общую картину, отметив самые важные её детали.
У лейтенанта Тита, которым и управляет игрок, есть показатель здоровья и брони. Когда заканчивается броня, начинает сокращаться запас HP. Когда уровень «жизней» доходит до нуля, герой теряет сознание и начинается отсчёт времени, в течение которого его можно поднять на ноги с бронёй и небольшим запасом здоровья. Но бесконечно «падать» и «вставать» не выйдет — после трёх поражений наступает смерть.
Запас здоровья можно повышать, используя «аптечки», которые восстанавливают от силы 40% красной полоски. Или накапливая и активируя «ярость» Тита. В любом случае, с одним только здоровьем без брони далеко не уедешь, поэтому при потере последней следует незамедлительно найти слабого врага и устроить добивание, которое восстановит одну шкалу брони. Появляется она и при успешном парировании/уклонении от атаки противника с последующим выстрелом в голову. Так что броня будет с вами и во время битв с боссами.
В арсенале нашего героя находится оружие ближнего и дальнего боя, а также гранаты. Как и в первой части, во время прохождения игры вы точно не останетесь без боеприпасов: и оружие, и патроны, и гранаты можно найти перед каждым более или менее важным боем.
Космодесантник несёт с собой одно оружие ближнего боя (что-то предпочтительно для одиночных целей, другое лучше подходит для атак по группе врагов), один «пистолет» и одну пушку посерьезнее (это могут быть снайперские винтовки и просто винтовки, автоматическое оружие и т. п.). Также герой экипирован гранатами одного типа. Кстати, иногда на пути Тита будут встречаться супер-пушки, позволяющие быстро расправляться с ордами врагов. Впрочем, они делают героя неповоротливым, а запас патронов для них не восполняется.
Каждый игрок по итогу найдёт для себя предпочтительное оружие. Или, скорее, предпочтительное сочетание оружия. Но в любом случае нам не удастся отсидеться за спинами компаньонов, стреляя по врагам издалека (не выйдет и полностью забыть о стрельбе). Рано или поздно придется обнажить Клинок или достать Молот, столкнувшись с противниками один на один… Хотя чаще бывает, что один на сотню.
В таком случае важно не зевать и следить за индикаторами на экране. Некоторые атаки врагов можно парировать, а от других спасают только увороты. Замешкался или нажал не туда — поплатился серьезной потерей брони и здоровья. Сделал всё вовремя — получаешь небольшое преимущество.

Вердикт
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 прекрасно подойдёт и любителям первой части, и поклонникам вселенной, которые не зря ждали новинку. И даже если вы не знатоки Warhammer 40,000, но уважаете добротный экшен и стрельбу по врагам из всех орудий — добро пожаловать!

 Время прохождения сюжета - 6 часов.


ПРЕДИСЛОВИЕ:
НЕ ИДИТЕ ИГРАТЬ В ПВЕ МИССИИ ПОКА НЕ ПРОЙДЁТЕ 2-3 СЮЖЕТНЫХ МИССИЙ, ВЫ ЗАРУИНИТЕ ВСЕЙ КОМАНДЕ КАТКУ, ИГРА ХАРДКОРНАЯ.

Сюжет тут для галочки.
Нужен лишь для ФАНАТОВ и для знакомства с механиками (в том числе с классами).
Весь сюжет - это обучение и подготовка к ПВЕ.


✅
Орды мобов, кровище, расчленёнка.


✅
2к, ультры, 50 фпс с исходным масштабированием (самое минимальное).
На 6750 GRE.

Правда количество экранов загрузки бесит.


✅
Думал что ""втупую"" можно будет бежать, а тут очень надо думать как поступить.

Часто проверяется твоя реакция.
Сделать ИДЕАЛЬНОЕ парирование, ИДЕАЛЬНОЕ уклонение.

В награду ты получаешь ячейку броню.


✅
У тебя мало хп, у врагов много урона, на самой ЛЁГКОЙ сложности в ПВЕ миссии тебе сносят 50% твоих хп за удар.

Это интересно тем, что ты становишься зависим от команды, вы не сможете пройти миссию, если будете играть каждый сам за себя.

Хилиться можно только эсту... ой, ШПРИЦАМИ, которые раскиданы в углах.

За снайпера важна позиционка, потому что снайпер ватный и за снайпера важен аим.
Количество брони зависит от класса.



⚡
Не ставлю диз, потому что это онлайн игра.

Для онлайн игры он даже не плох, но его миссии это ""обороняй генератор"" и условно за одну миссию ты 5 раз защищаешь что-то от орд врагов.

Для сюжета могли бы что-то интереснее придумать, головоломки разные.

В сюжете нету никакой прогрессии, вся прокачка в ПВЕ миссиях.
ПВЕ миссии интереснее сюжетных, с уникальными боссами и погодными условиями.
Чего стоит эпичная миссия с драконом, который всю локу огнём поливает.


⚡
Всего 50 гигов весит игра.
Локации красивые, по дизайну, но текстуры это 2015 год, потому что даже Ассасин Одиссея имеет круче графику.

Модельки пластилиновые, очень хорошо это заметно по волосам, от которые ОТРАЖАЕТСЯ СВЕТ.
СВЕТ ОТ ВОЛОС.


⚡
Не влияет на геймплей, но влияет на погружение.
Её нет.
Задеваешь бочку - бочка улетает на соседнюю локацию.

Огромные двери, которые весят несколько тонн открываются как пластиковые дверцы.



❌
На данный момент в игре 6 ПВЕ миссий.
Проходишь их все на хардкоре - считай прошёл всю игру.
Дальше тебе остаётся лишь прокачивать каждый класс, путем перепрохождения этих же самых миссий, в которых один и тот же сценарий.


❌
Фу.
Во-первых в игре мало окружающих звуков.
Во-вторых те, что есть не имеют объёма, не имеют пространственности.
Выстрелы не дают вибрацию.
Топот брони тоже из 2015 года.

Музыка незаметна.


❌
Очень скудно.

Большой минус игры.
У классов на выбор 3 основных оружия (которое может повторяться у разных классов)
и 1 слот под мили + 1 слот под пистолет, где уже выбора нет.

То есть играя за снайпера я не могу выбрать себе 2 и 3 оружие, у других классов так же.
Ты бегаешь то, с чем тебя дают.

В целом оружий около 15 видов и это такое оружие
""Болт-1"" магазин 12 патронов, урон 4.
""Болт-2"" магазин 36 патронов, урон 2.
""Болт-3"" магазин 500 патронов, большая отдача.


❌
Челы сразу регают ПВЕ миссию, не разобравшись с механиками игры, их убивают - и они ливают.

Нужны наказания за выход из матча и ограничение чтобы на высокую сложность не прокали челы с 1 лвлом.


❌
Сильная халтура
Редкий скин оружия - печать висит у ствола.
Легендарный - печать висит у курка.

Редкий скин брони - верёвка белого цвета.
Легендарный - верёвка красного цвета.
Висит верёвка в таком же положении.


❌
Хотелось бы, для знакомства со вселенной БЕСТИАРИЙ?
Что мы за отряд?
Чё это за враги?
Почему мы сражаемся с ними?
Откуда они взялись?

В игре есть аудио-дневники, и всё. (они кстати хорошо прописаны, в стиле рассказа историй, а не чьих-то мыслей)

❌
Шёл 2024 год, разработчики игр до сих пор не умели прописывать интеллект ни мобам ни союзникам.

Боты кроме как поднять тебя ничего не могут.
Враги не тригерятся на них, умышленно оббегают и бегут к игрокам.
Сами боты не могут казнить оглушённых врагов и перестают стрелять в них.
У ботов в целом порезан урон и повышена выживаемость.

СКМ - прицел.
ПКМ - удар мили.
С - парирование

Я бы сделал СКМ - ульта, ПКМ - прицел, Q - удар мили.

CAMPAIGN:
This is a excellent addition to the Warhammer 40K Gaming Universe. The creative team did a great job at providing a fresh story experience while building on the narrative of the original. You really do learn to appreciate and fight with your squad by the end. I could go on at length, but the Emperors work is best experienced rather than described. Take up your weapon and purge the enemies of Man!!!

+ Combat is fluid and dynamic.
+ Excellent variety of weapons
+ Action and design of gameplay, characters an d plot feel true to the setting.
+ Truly breathtaking environment design ... This wholly immerses you in the monumental scale of
the 41st Millenium.
- I preferred the shield and health system from the first game, but this is fine once you adapt to it.
- They removed dodge rolling, now dodge is more of a standard scoot to the side :( (But effective)
(+/-) Jump-pack feels slowed down vs the first game, but has significantly more utility so YMMV.

Saber Interactive saw the Helldivers 2 nerf controversy and must have said to themselves ""Yeah, let's nerf the fun like Arrowhead Studios did."" This is a classic Spongebob ""How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?"" moment. If you want players to utilize specific weapons, nerfing the ""more powerful"" variant will not encourage players to use them, you're just making the weapons they've been using more frustrating to play with, so they are going to get mad at you and make fun of you for it. This is a big reason why the Helldivers 2 player average dropped massively following the Escalation of Freedom Update. I will never understand this balancing philosophy for PVE games. Space Marine 2 is a power fantasy, yet they are removing the power aspect from it.


I have played through the original 6 operations on Substantial and Ruthless quite a few times across all classes and never once thought to myself ""Man... this is way too easy, I wish the developers would do something to make this harder."" Let's talk about the nerfs specifically:



Translation: Fencing weapons are essentially as hard to achieve a parry as Balanced weapons now. If both types have the same perfect parry window ""duration"", then there is no reason to choose Fencing over Balanced now. This will not entice players to use Block weapon types, because I could argue that parrying is a requirement on Substantial, Ruthless, and now especially Lethal to avoid taking massive damage and restore armor when you're getting swarmed by enemies, Minoris and Majoris alike.



I never found Auspex Scan to have a significant damage bonus on Terminus enemies. It was a noticeable effect, but this is just an unnecessary nerf given how much health they have and aren't easy to kill even with Auspex Scan.



I assume they mean 'Melta Bomb' because that's what this equipment is called in-game, an item I felt its intended use was specifically for bosses or packed groups of enemies. It did good damage to bosses but it never was an instant kill. A 70% damage reduction to bosses now means there's no real reason to carry a Melta Bomb unless there's nothing else to grab and you're out of grenades. After reading this, I'm convinced Saber Interactive does not even play or test their own game. I'm pressing X for Doubt.





This is pretty bad news for anyone who enjoys playing as Heavy. Ammunition on Ruthless and even Substantial has already been scarce, and the Heavy is the class that is supposed to be the ranged powerhouse. Without ammo, Heavy is borderline useless since he is the only class that does not have a melee weapon. Majoris enemies on Substantial and above are very numerous and already bullet sponges.
The player's armor reduction is just another unnecessary nerf; armor values and damage felt reasonable before this update. Remember when a single hit from a Minoris enemy drained a full armor segment in 1.0? I thought Saber was on the right track after they tweaked that, but it turns out I was wrong.










I'm not opposed to a new difficulty, but it's how they have implemented it that I have a problem with, and there is no reason to attempt this mode other than curiosity and players going for 100%. Completing this across all operations rewards you with a damaged starting helm that you can use across all classes and a Power Sword skin. 2 cosmetics that don't even look good for overcoming such a challenge. The majority of players have yet to complete a Ruthless Operation so far, so I don't know why they'd even implement a Lethal difficulty just a month after the game's release; it seems like a waste of resources.
I already covered limited ammo refills, but I want to go over armour restoration: How am I supposed to restore armour as Sniper, Vanguard or Assault? Players naturally become separated from each other during waves/massive waves and mission objectives that . You can't just apply a mandatory tether to players thinking it creates ""teamwork"". It's just a stupid way of making the game harder.






I think Chaos Operations are less popular than Tyranids because of how annoying Chaos can be, especially Rubric Marines, an enemy that will consistently and unpredictably teleport over large distances to either evade you or attack you is not the best game design in my opinion. It reminds me of the Knights from Halo 4, an enemy that isn't fun to fight. I never found Chaos Operations to be easier than Tyranids. Even after this patch, you still think Operations mode is a bit too easy? How? I doubt you guys even play your own game.


I never disable comments on any of my reviews. That being said, it has lead to some interesting and heated interactions. Like Helldivers 2, I have seen a few super elite gamers sweeping, generalizing and disparaging those of us voicing our opinions on the update ""cry this whine that"". Which is ironic, because you're crying about people complaining. Understand that you are the minority with that hot take and those of you who sit in forums all day to argue for nerfs, you must live a very insignificant life.

The purpose of this review was to express my discontent with the developers over the direction they are taking Space Marine 2. I believed balance was in an okay spot for Space Marine 2, and Saber should have focused on creating content rather than nerfing. If Saber Interactive is remotely sensible, they'll follow Arrowheads lead and eventually swallow their pride (which took them months to do).

The Mogician,0,60,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198851368116/,"Very tough decision for me to give this a not recommended review, but I think there are some glaring issues that should be addressed.

First off, the pros:
1. It looks great. Starting from the bigger things. The game is set on three very different and distinct planets: Kadaku, a jungle world, Avarax, a hive world and Demerium, a cemetery world. Each of the planets have their very own distinct style and feel to it. Then down to the smaller details. There are a lot of details in the game that also breath life into the game and adds to the whole WH40K experience. Bravo.
2. The gameplay is great. If you enjoyed the first space marine game, odds are, you will enjoy this one as well. The melee and shooting all feel very satisfying. Popping off a headshot or pulling off a finisher all feel very satisfying.
3. The story is pretty good. I mean, Warhammer games are not always known for having interesting stories, especially also considering this game is supposed to be a hack and slash kinda brainless fun game. All in all, I enjoyed the story thus far. Additional points go to the fact that the coop missions are also parallel to the main missions.

Next, onto the cons:
1. The story is a bit short for its price. There are 7 main story missions (8 if you count prologue) and 5 coop missions that will help flesh out the main story missions (6 if you count Ballistic engine, which isn't really mentioned anywhere in the main missions). I did the game on Angels of Death difficulty and it should take about 15 hours to complete. If you count the coop missions in, it should take about 25-30 hours in total if you wanna enjoy the whole story at least once. Slightly on the short side for the price they are charging.
2. It can be a real grindfest. Tying into the last point. What it does not have in length, it makes up for the sheer amount of grind you will need to do. To unlock all the armor sets for each class, you need to play 35 matches per class, with a total of 210 matches. Assuming you don't do PvP like I do, let's assume each match takes 30 minutes (I think that's the bare minimum unless you do speedrun), and you win every single match. That is like 100+ hours right there that requires you to grind. Now, I'm not against having a lot of coop time to pad out the game time, but since there are only six maps, things can get stale real soon. I hate doing comparisons, but If you compare it with games like Vermintide 2. Vermintide 2 had 13 missions in total when it first launched, which will ensure a relatively healthy mix of varied missions. Here's hoping the devs would add in more coop missions down the line.
3. Twitch drops. Really? I mean, all the clown awards that went into the announcement post should be telling. It is one thing to do exclusive twitch drops that requires you to watch it (since you can just leave it in the background), it is altogether another to require people subbing and giving out subscriptions. This is toxic.

All in all, I enjoyed the game itself, but I really do not enjoy some of the other decisions the devs made for the game.",2024/9/10,en
Wooohooo,1,11,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Woooohoooo/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2

Despite the fact that the review is positive, for me it's more of a ""yellow"" type of review (which I hope they will eventually add to Steam, though I’m starting to doubt it). The game looks expensive and polished, it's a good, not overly long action game set in the Warhammer universe, with excellent cutscene direction and beautiful visuals. The combat looks epic, and the gameplay on a gamepad is really well done. The joystick vibrates and even reacts to walking, giving the character in the Space Marine suit a sense of ""weight.""

However, that's where the positives end for me. Here's what really bothered me. First, the combat feels quite repetitive. While smashing enemies is fun in the first few hours, it quickly gets stale and stops being enjoyable. Moreover, I noticed that the difficulty seems a bit broken because on higher difficulty levels, combat turns into an unpleasant mess. You have to constantly spam parries, and even then, enemies will still flank you and ""make your life miserable."" But if you lower the difficulty just one notch, the game becomes too easy and uninteresting.

The variety of enemies is small, and they're pretty dull, requiring no special tactics to defeat. The multiplayer PvP mode, by the way, is terrible - I didn't like it at all, and I don't recommend it. It feels like it's just there for the sake of it.
The special operations that run parallel to the story can be considered a positive aspect, as they let you try out different Space Marine classes and include some progression. However, they don't add much depth to the game, though they do make it a bit better.

For fans of the Warhammer universe or those who just want to switch off their brain and enjoy some action and shooting for a couple of evenings, I would recommend it. But it's best not to have high expectations, as they got in the way for me.",2024/9/18,en

As in, after EVERY mission/op/session of ANY kind I am disconnected from the servers with no way of reconnecting. The only way to ""fix"" it is to ALT+F4 and restart the game. And you can't make progress offline (at least with ops) as it isn't saved. Would it be such a big deal to fix that if I wanted to solo some ops? I've had multiple runs where I would make it to the end of a mission and disconnect RIGHT before getting out. VERY disappointing. I've tried the PVP side of things as well and I can barely get through a match without getting a network error, and all my progress is lost. So what's the point?

So that being said the game is GOOD enough to make me want to slog through this madness, but I'd wait until a patch releases that addresses these issues first before throwing down on it.",2024/9/17,en

Rip The Bugs, Tear The Heretics
I’m sure each of us has at least one franchise out there where you’re consistently reminded of its existence, but continuously avoid it through the years for one reason or another. I can’t tell you exactly what kept me from getting into Warhammer, but my awareness of its quantity-over-quality approach to video games was probably the main demotivator. But even I stood up when they announced a sequel to Space Marine, widely regarded as one of the best games in the franchise. After getting the opportunity to review this sequel, I went to play the original for the first time, and loved its aggressive ranged and melee combat alongside a basic but interesting story which ended on a surprisingly dark note for lead character Titus. Despite being made by a different developer, Space Marine 2 feels like the natural evolution of that experience, boasting deeper combat, top-tier presentation, and a solid selection of modes, though its lean amount of content currently makes it a ‘greater than the sum of its parts’ type of situation.

Let’s start with the game’s unifying elements, namely the combat and visuals. Space Marine 2’s combat is unique in the sense that melee is as valuable and persistent as a tool for dispatching threats as your guns, where left-clicking fires the latter, and right-clicking switches you to the former instantaneously. This will be necessary when you start dealing with large enemy swarms, as your melee weapon can be a reliable tool for parrying anything that dares to get too close, and your gun is the fastest way of earning back contested health and hence keep you in the fight for longer. Dealing enough damage will open enemies up for executions to restore both health and armour, and timing this correctly is the difference between a marine that’s down and out, or one that’s alive and angry. This creates a visceral combat loop where aggression is necessary for survival, and the right tool for the job is always available. Backed up by solid weapon variety and meaty gun sounds across the board, the combat is the power fantasy of a Space Marine fully realised.

Visually, this is undoubtedly one of the best-looking games on the market. Character and enemy models are highly detailed, insinuating the war history of your brothers and the deadliness of your foes, environments feel larger than life, and the technology used to deliver these massive enemy swarms is incredibly impressive. Looking out into the battlefield and seeing hundreds of enemies consistently left me in awe; games have rarely been able to capture that sense of scale, yet Space Marine 2 rose to this challenge and triumphed.

Space Marine 2 offers three distinct modes, being the Campaign, PvE, and PvP. The Campaign continues the story of Demetrian Titus, an Ultramarine accused of heresy, brought back into the fray after years of service to the Deathwatch to assist in fighting a Tyranid invasion and the forces of Chaos. While it is simple and competent enough to stand on its own, the narrative works best if you’ve experienced the original. There are plot elements and conversations that carry substantial weight if you know Titus’ history, while the plot developments outside of this, especially the ending, were largely underwhelming.

The structure and progression of the campaign has me feeling mixed overall. Each mission is surprisingly long, taking you through multiple different locations and large combat sequences, really immersing you in these high-stakes operations. This helps as the campaign is oppressively linear and not very replayable, with no substantial side paths, identical enemy spawn patterns, and zero character progression, ultimately making it feel a bit repetitive by the midway point. Indeed, the PvE mode is arguably the strongest element of the package because of its character-building possibilities, and where the combat really started to click for me. You’ll select one of six classes to tackle shorter but still diverse missions which take place adjacent to the main campaign, gaining exp and currency to improve your abilities and weapons to ultimately tackle the highest difficulties. Every class feels distinct yet equally powerful, helped by active abilities which double down on their specialities. The Bulwark gets a banner that can regenerate armour, the Tactical has a marking tool which temporarily provides a major damage boost to the target, and my personal favourite, the Assault, has a permanent jump pack that opens up considerable offensive and defensive options. However, there are only six missions, and no amount of changing up enemy placements is going to make moving through these same environments any less repetitive.

My sole criticism for the PvP is nearly identical, as there are currently only three modes and maps, an incredibly low number that gives the impression it was tacked on like the good old early 2010s days. Which is a shame, as this combat model built for large hordes is seamlessly converted into one that is equally satisfying when staring down the barrel of other Space Marines. All of the practice you gained in PvE with each class ability can be put to great use in either the deathmatch or objective modes, though this different context allows some of them to take on new uses, such as allowing the Vanguard or Sniper to flank behind the enemy with their grapple hook and cloak abilities respectively.

While Space Marine 2 is undoubtedly a next-gen title, I did not experience the consistent 60fps that was promised by the recommended requirements. This game is quite CPU demanding due to the enemy density, though despite upgrading my CPU mid-review period to one that should clear the recommended requirements, hectic combat sequences would still consistently drop below 60fps, even on medium settings. These drops were worse and more consistent before the upgrade (from a Ryzen 7 3700X to a Ryzen 9 5900X if you’re curious), though PvP and less dense arenas have few issues maintaining stability. If you possess a very high-end build, you will probably run this game fine, but anything less and you should be prepared to tolerate a consistently sub-par frame rate in some areas.

Outside of performance issues, the game is very polished. I experienced a single crash and no major bugs, though the squad AI could use some adjustments as their pathing is occasionally very illogical, sometimes failing to revive a teammate even when they’re only 10 metres away, for instance. Matchmaking was also inconsistent, particularly with PvP where there were long periods when I was unable to get into any match. PvE matchmaking has been largely solid, although the omission of Day 1 private lobbies is a very disappointing decision. This frustration was compounded after I consistently got put into groups where the host was playing my class, forcing me to back out due to the one-per-class limit. Filtering options and general online stability improvements are needed.

Space Marine 2 is a visually stunning third-person combat masterclass, which shines brightest if you delve deeply into every mode. In isolation, its linear campaign and content-deficient online modes would bring down a less complete game, but the fact that all of these elements are present under one banner means it currently offers a great package which will almost certainly become exceptional with time. I’ll definitely be revisiting it at every major update for a long while to come.",2024/9/18,en
Baffin,1,147.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/baffinrider/,"За императора!

Никогда не был фанатом Вархаммера, но тут подумал что игра стала шибко мемной и популярной и решил прикупить. Цена конечно - жаба душит, но честно не пожалел нисколько потраченных денег, мало того, подарил ещё двум друзьям. Итак спустя достаточно долгое время могу выкатить полноценный обзор

Сюжет

Приятно что для понимания сюжета быть фанатом вахи совсем необязательно, в принципе всё и так предельно ясно особенно для человека, который плюс-минус видел пару мемов с вахой и решил игру таки купить. Однако не скажу что меня прям сюжет дико впечатлил или пробрал до глубины души - но на мой взгляд в этом нет необходимости. Игра представляет собой помесь дума и квейка, собственно в виду этого со своей задачей продемонстрировать нам максимально подробно резню ксеносов она справляется на отлично, не думаю что нужно что-то большее. Хотя конечно хорошего саундтрека не хватает, на мой взгляд что-то в стиле дума было бы очень к месту. Сама кампания напоминает о тех временах когда одиночные игры были простыми и хорошими, без всяких гомоповесточек или сложных моралей. К сожалению само прохождение занимает всего коло 10 часов да и в целом как таковая кампания не очень сложная, особенно если проходить в коопе даже на самых высоких сложностях.

Мультиплеер

Больше всего порадовали операции в которых я надолго задержался. Во-первых довольно широкий выбор оружия и классов с разными способностями с возможностью прокачки всего и вся. Во-вторых уровни сложностей, где самые высокие сложности действительно могут представлять вызов. Очень жаль что со смертельной сложности убрали механику, при которой броня не восстанавливалась, если ты не находился вдали от отряда - на мой взгляд после этого изменения играть стало слишком легко (учитывая что я прошёл на этой сложности почти все операции в её ещё старом виде). В остальном здесь можно в принципе задержаться часиков на сто, поиграть с друзьями, поубивать ксеносов.
Что касается пвп - он в принципе неплох, но нет разнообразия режимов, да и я лично не очень люблю пвп с высоким ттк. Одним словом - на любителя. Огорчает ограниченная кастомизация для хаоситов по сравнению с имперцами - надеюсь в будущем добавят намного больше.


В целом игра рекомендуется к покупке, вне зависимости от того, фанат ли ты Вархаммера или нет. Если покупал DOOM 2016 не задумывайся - покупай и это.",2024/11/4,ru

The story is awesome, its short (around 10h) but not every game needs to be 100+h just looking for 100 collectibles or walking aimlessly through an empty open world that alot of games have had recently.

Combat is fluent and clean, feels like a mix of gears of war and a bit of soulslike with the parrying and dodging. It's not clunky at all like some people say it is.

Most weapons feels good to use and combat finishers is a dopamine rush when they occur especially on bosses.

Operations (PvE mode) while being few at launch is just pure fun to play and all the classes has their own specialty so it makes it fun to try them all and max their level to max.

I haven't tried the PvP yet so i can't speak on that.

Not a single microtransaction or ingame store, you just have to play to earn cosmetics like the good old days. (there are dlc for more but im fine with that.)

EPIC ONLINE SERVICEが初回起動時に強制インストールされるのでクロスプレイしないなら手動で消す必要がある。ついでにSSD以外に入れたらまともに動かない
RAM16GB位は食い尽くしてるから32GB以上にした方がいいゾ。最近APEX用にPCを買いdiscordを使っている環境ではかなりギリギリになるので今後のゲームの為にも増設した方がいいゾ。

ストーリーは？
WARHAMMER40Kを知らない場合、ストーリーは置いてけぼりになりそうな感じがあるけど、詳しく知りたい場合はミニチュアゲームに足を踏み込むことになるので考えない方がいいゾ。
今作を簡単に説明すると

イナゴが来たから駆除が一番わかりやすい。

戦闘システムとかは？
オープンワールドではないゾ。ステージ形式で黒神話悟空みたいに迷子になることはないゾ。
基本的にはボルターという銃と拾った銃の２個、近接武器１個なので装備の幅としては少ないゾ。
大立ち回りをしながら回避、パリィ、カウンターをしながら戦うスタイルだゾ。
敵を倒すとアーマーが回復するのでスペースマリーンらしく攻撃的なプレイになるゾ。
反射神経必須に感じるけどちゃんと青、黄色、赤と警告がでてるので対応するボタンポチーしたら自動でやってくれるゾ。
いつも通りの目分量適当調整なので気にする人は向いてないゾ。

マウスホイール押し込んでADSするのに慣れないと近接武器を突然振り始めるのはみんな通る道だゾ。




Q.なんか値段高くない？
A.ミニチュアも1個で似た金額だから安い。
スペースマリーン複数とティラニド網羅してるから1万円で15万円分の価値はある。
無料ゲームに慣れ過ぎだゾ。（4日の先行アクセスの為だけにゴールドエディションをギフトで配りながら）

A.ALT TABで起動待機中に別の事をやると動かなくなる。ゲーム開始後のムービーでクラッシュする場合はプリセットが低になってないかを確認する。最初のムービーだけ画質が違うので低プリセットの720pにしてる場合、1920*1080に変更し、いったんメモリに全部読み込ませた方がいい。メモリ性能が低い可能性があるので、惑星が映った瞬間にESCで一時停止して1~2分位待機してから再生するとスムーズに進める。15万くらいのPCだと大体安いメモリだから読み込みが遅い。ムービーを突破したら設定をする。
特に最低要求のパソコンの場合、8GBのメモリになるので更に読み込みが遅くなるので放置したほうがいい。今時8GBでゲームするのならAPEX Legendsに籠ってた方がいい。わざわざメモリ抜いてまで確認したんだから褒めろ。褒めて。

それでもダメなら
forza horizon5の時の裏技を駆使し、インターネット回線抜いてオフライン環境でスキップする。それ以外なら知らん。どうせアバストだろ

設定にある布の動きの～設定を下げる。その辺の旗や肩についてるレシートなども対象になってるぽい。後はロード時にメモリに全部データを保管して読み込んでいる感があるのでメモリも容量増やした方がいいゾ。
それ以外には青い熊さんがエルデンリングと同じ理由だと思うゾ。
独り言だけどEACのアフェニティルールを変更してCPUシングルコアに対象変更すると幸せになれるかもしれない。マルチプレイ逝ったらしーらない。素直に更新待った方がいいゾ


これじゃスペースマリーンじゃなくてステルスマリーンだね！グラボのメモリが最低要件以下（4GB等）だと発生する。フレンド用メモ
・GPUのドライバーverが最新化確認する。
・何故かプリセット低設定では何も描画されなくなるので中設定に警告が出てきても無視して変更後、手動で設定をする。
・プリセット中 FSR 低テクスチャで大体なんとかなる
・60fps制限で低テクスチャにする。心配なら他も低に変更していく
・TAAにするとなぜか上回ってるグラボでも消える
↑で解決しない場合


になってるぐらいなので修正待ちかグラボが最低要件以下のどちらかの可能性があるゾ



Q.スペースマリーンの強さって？
A.一般兵士と比較した場合、ドラゴンボールのナッパとクリリン位の差がある程度には強い。

Q.なんか銃弱くない？
A.弾のサイズはよくあるFPSみたいな5.56mmではなく、お店で売っている「黒色で緑の3本縦線がある缶」とほぼ同じ大きさなので威力として超高いゾ。
ちなみにそこら辺で倒れている一般兵士はよくある弾から、翼を授ける缶位の大きさの弾を使ってる。
単純に相手が悪いだけだゾ。

異端審問官だった人はわかるけどクソデカボルターを無反動で片手撃ちしてるゾ。アレの強さを知ってるなら異端審問官の相手はお遊戯会だゾ。ダークタイドにマリーンいなくてよかったね。速攻鎮圧されてたゾ。

Q.何で少数で出撃するの？
A.スペースマリーン100人で師団クラスの戦力で、育成とかが10年単位で反逆されないよう洗脳も含めてで増えにくい為、人員不足と過労気味。何処かのスーパーアースのように誰でも志願したら採用されるわけでもないので結構ジリ貧気味。ちなみにアーマーは職人の手作りで生産性もカス。
追い打ちで縦にも横にもデカイ重いで輸送機にも数人しか入らない。
という欠点を補える位には単体の戦闘力が本来はクソ高い。
何故かゲーム内では数回殴られたら死ぬけど。

Q.肩とかにレシートついてるけど
A.良くアレの正式名称忘れるからレシートって呼んでる。レシートでいいよ。
純潔の印だかプリティシールだとかそんなの。要は営業マンとかの売り上げ順位トップでもらう表彰状とかと同じ。

Q.機械精霊って何？
A.わかりやすく言うと不具合やバグなどの動作不良だゾ。修正する技術はなくなったので祈るという動作で「どうか壊れないでクレメンス・・・」な感じでグリスアップしたり、放置で放電や冷却してるゾ。

Q.スペースマリーンってハイテク兵士だよね？
A.実はあの世界基準で見たら若干時代遅れ気味。

Q.ドレッドノート先輩は？
A.いる　205Ｐに勝てる


Q.もしかしてブラック
A.少し前に大量転職した。

Q.チュートリアル後の会話で18の機能って？
A.




















Q.やっぱりブラックじゃない？
A.だから大量転職したって

Q.オペレーションモードってCOOPは？
A.現状プライベートロビーがない。クラス被りは許されないので野良に参加するか、自分がホストするか、フレンド集めるかの３択をしながらホスト以外はクラス被りしてると永遠にマッチしないのでコロコロクラスを変えながらマッチ待機する。野良参加でホストが走って行ってダウンして抜けるか、自分がホストして自慢げに進行する野良がダウンしていなくなるか、固めて疑似プライベートロビーにするかの３択

Q.PvPは触れてないけどやらないの？
A.プライベートロビー実装されたら12人でやるので今の所興味がない。DoWとかでバランスがゴミカスなのも知ってるゾ。似たコンセプトでのGearsで破綻してたのも知ってるから余計に興味がないゾ。
Quakeとかみたいなガチガチのアリーナなら興味あるけど最近のAPEXから参入したキルモンタージュ程度で盛り上がるガキのような集団とは特に戯れたくないが本音(直球)
1VS1が実装されたら本格的にはやると思う。


ちなみにワイは



キャンペーンは楽しかった以外特に触れない場合。
クリア後にはゲーム進行やキャラクター育成の手段としてキャンペーンがまったく役に立たないチュートリアルという事実と少し時代遅れ気味なPvEマッチメイキングモードと、キャラクターの進行とリプレイ性のためのカスタマイズが備わっているゾ。
WH40Kしてるとなると一番わかりやすいのがDarktideに似たモードで、現時点では 6 つのマップしかない。 比較するとかなり必要最低限なのは、複数の種類のモードを提供しようとしているからだと思うぞ。PvPはゴミだけど。実績取ったら二度とやらないと思うけどプライベートロビー実装されたら解除用でやるレベル

他のcoopとの最大の違いは、受け流し/カウンター、回避、豆鉄砲、そして一般的な戦闘の流れが異なって機能する戦闘ゲームプレイだゾ。
実際に慣れるまでの最初の1～2時間は、戦闘がちょっと微妙だと思ってたゾ。
テンポ、攻撃優先順位、所持する武器によるプレイスタイルの違い、慣れてくると楽しくなる。
オペレーションモードではチームプレイが要求され、難易度が高いほどレベリングが必要になり口頭でのコミュニケーションが求められるゾ。野良でワイが上記のCOOPの文句書いてた位だし。失敗しても経験値もらえるけどソロで駆け抜けて一気に稼ぎたい。

戦闘について不平を言っている人は、操作に慣れていない問題であると思うゾ
ゲームの核となる知識と操作スキルが伴ってくると楽しくなるだろうけど無理そうなら返金したらいいゾ

魅力的かどうかはわからないけど設定と全体的なアートデザインでもいいゾ。
環境、アーキテクチャ、キャラクター (主にスペースマリンコ) のデザインは、十分な性能のPCを持っている場合は、現状最高のスペースマリーン体験入隊ごっことミニチュアの塗装資料になる。

キャンペーン、COOP、PvP など全コンテンツに興味があるのであれば、このゲームは現在の価格に見合った価値があると思うゾ。COOPのみに興味がある場合は、それでも価値があるかもしれないけど、もう少し充実したコンテンツが提供されるまで待つことをお勧めするゾ (おそらくセールで安くなるし)PvEではリプレイ性はほとんどレベリング以外なく、ロードマップを見ると、これは変わらないと思うし、マップごとに異なる目的が考えられるので、同じマップでも異なる体験ができることを期待し、発売当初は6マップでいいと思ってたんです。
まさかリプレイ価値のない6つの固定ミッションになるとは思ってなかったゾ。

リプレイって意味ではボーダーランズ2やレムナント2のようなゲームを検索してみるといいゾ。

퍼즐이나 길 찾기 없이 돌격하며 직진하면 진행되는 상남자식 캠페인 진행 방식도 굉장히 만족스러웠습니다. 전투 스타일과 게임 분위기와도 잘 맞더라고요. 전투를 벌이는 각각의 공간들도 압도적으로 아름다우며 구석구석 신경 쓴 티가 나는 장식들도 눈을 뗄 수 없게 합니다. 신성 로마 제국을 연상케 하는 문화와 디자인 콘셉트도 흥미로운 볼거리고요.

캠페인은 8시간 가량에 엔딩을 볼 수 있어 그리 길지는 않지만, 엔드 콘텐츠는 PvE와 PvP로 따로 있습니다. 캠페인에서는 써볼 수 없었던 무기도 있고 기술도 여러 가지가 추가돼서 캠페인과는 다른 재미가 있고, 여섯 개의 직업을 전부 키운다면 플레이 타임도 엄청나게 늘어날 것 같더라고요. 다만 너무 반복적이긴 해서 제 취향은 아니었는데, 캐릭터 성장을 위해 반복 플레이하는 과정을 평소에도 즐기는 편이라면 할 만할 것도 같습니다.

이 정도면 IP 기반의 게임은 물론이고 매번 이렇다 할 성과를 내지 못해 온 워해머의 디지털 게임들 중 아주 바람직한 케이스가 아닐까 싶습니다. 얼마나 워해머 시리즈를 좋아하고 마초적인 캐릭터와 전투 방식을 선호하느냐에 따라 만족도는 달라질 수 있겠지만, 캠페인이 전부인 게임은 아님에도 캠페인만 보더라도 플레이 할 가치가 있는 게임이라고 생각합니다.

shokakuprprpr,0,100.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198245079406/,"以下是根据游玩体验得出的一些个人碎碎念，仅代表个人观点。
本人首发标准版玩家，因为本身对40K世界观的了解和兴趣拉着朋友一起入坑的游戏。因为本身就是冲着PVE为目的玩的，所以在第一次难度下调前就靠跑图单刷以及与朋友联机的方式将所有职业刷到了25级并至少有一套圣物级装备。
个人感觉在最初版本时。难度主要来自于敌人过高的伤害以及医疗物资的匮乏，但是大部分的职业拥有热熔/榴弹、激光狙的过量治疗或者技能这样的额外恢复手段，虽然限制了配装的多样化和游戏一部分乐趣，但凭借着刷不同装备和职业的新鲜感还是有一定的游戏体验。同时也因为是新游戏，个人认为在后续的更新中也将会对某些较为弱势的武器或职业进行调整。
而后续的更新带来的平衡我认为是一次不错的更新，虽然过量治疗被当成BUG修复，但是怪物伤害的降低等一系列对敌人的削弱以及格挡小怪回甲的改动也给玩家增加了容错，同时使一些本来下水道的职业(牢锤：勿CUE）也有了游戏乐趣。这也使我更期待第二赛季的更新。
但10.17这次的更新不能说非常失败，只能说依托构式。更新后我与朋友进行了三把联机游戏，自己进行了三把单刷。
首先说说新版本的N5难度的新机制之一的连携回甲，在离开队友一定距离后包含强袭处决等一系列的回复护甲手段均不生效，这固然是鼓励抱团游戏的一种方式，但是军刀的设计师就和小脑偏瘫一样给了一个及其短小的距离，短小到近战角色冲锋开路时的一个突刺就会冲出距离，直接导致了“近战职业想要近战”、“远程职业想要在相对怪少的地方进行输出“就会出现回不了护甲情况，除非你的队伍构成为全近战或是全远程，否则至少有一个玩家是长时间处于无法恢复护甲OR摸鱼的状态下的，因此即使是和朋友组队也不会有很好的游戏的体验。
如果说N5作为给少数玩家设计的有挑战性的难度且刚推出不好平衡是有一定理由的话，接下来的改动也同时影响到了本来已经有一定良好体验的前四个难度。
更新了高难度下护甲的减少，N3 -10%，N4 -20%.这项改动使得玩家的血量容错率大概上回到了版本增强前的水平。本来对于我这样的玩家来说应该是影响不大的，但是配合下文的刷怪机制变动使得游戏体验更下了一层楼。
其次是刷怪机制的变动，在刷怪机制变动后精英怪物的数量明显有着巨大的提升，以N3.N4的炼狱为例，更新后道中的随便一条路上可能会同时刷出10个左右的一堆精英怪，且远程怪的攻击频率因为数量的巨大提升得到了巨大加强。如果说近战怪还能依靠熟练的弹反来在怪堆中无双，那么远程怪就和往你脸上扔屎一样恶心。接近两只手数量的精英远程有的在地上打满“铁丝网”限制走位和站桩，有的时不时来一发狙击出其不意，还有的不停射击散弹进行压制。上去尝试用近战，被切的目标在后撤步拖延时间的同时其余的远程依旧在对你进行巨量的输出和干扰。至于远程对射，除了榴弹和等离子这样的OP武器就更不可能在换血里赢过对面的怪海了。而上文提到的护甲减少，配合上制作组把发医疗包等资源的钱留给他妈买骨灰盒导致补给偏少等问题，一起形成了完美COMBO,大大降低了面对远程时的容错和承伤能力，使得体验进一步下降。
再加上发售时就存在的近战武器的近战伤害过低只能靠弹反强袭出伤害，爆弹枪全家幽默伤害这些的问题，官方在知道这些问题的情况下不作为，或者是用增加近战武器蓄力伤害这种几乎没有屌用的方法进行敷衍，更是大大降低了我对游戏的热情。
总体而言，我对当前版本的评价是：能玩，但没必要。
作为一个喜爱40K IP的玩家，游戏内容少我可以等更新，平衡不到位可以调整，我是希望游戏能越做越好。但对于傻逼军刀，我只想说，我玩这个游戏是因为它是40K的IP，你saber就踏马一坨狗屎，销量上去了人就飘了，属于是烂泥扶不上墙，是不是和隔壁WG，BVVD一样都不玩自己游戏的？什么吊样你自己看不到吗？该平衡的地方在那里敷衍，然后整一堆烂活试探玩家底线？ 2024/10/19/1:30",2024/10/18,zh-cn

Hacía rato que no disfrutaba una campaña de un juego tan bien lograda, la historia es emocionante, la jugabilidad es adictiva, combates intensos, el sistema de bloqueos con remates me vuela de gusto, gráficos y sonidos impresionantes, van al compás del universo Warhammer.

La campaña son 6 misiones, pero quiero remarcar que son largas las misiones, lei gente quejándose que es muy corta y están errados!

Operaciones (Pve), es el modo más popular del juego, aquí de momento tenemos para seleccionar 6 tipos de clases, se podra ir progresando los personajes en skill, armamentos, cosméticos, pinturas etc; los retos y la jugabilidad están garantizados, existen 6 diferentes misiones y duran aproximadamente 30min a mas si se extienden por dificultades, además existen 4 modos de dificultades (el reto seria ganar en la última “Despiadada”, un abuso de golpes imagino)
Si se darán cuenta, este juego tiene una similitud en cuanto a la selección de modos, progreso, la base al “Aliens Fireteam Elite” y si son los mismos editores.

Modo Guerra Eterna (PvP), Existen 3, conquista, capturas y aniquilación de momento; No esta mal pero esto no es un juego para competitivo, esta para pasar un buen rato con team de amigos y no mas; permite equipos de hasta 6 x bandos, probé los modos y no me generan esa adrenalina como en otros shooters en 3ra, “es obvio acá te moves como tortuga ja”

Lo voy a poner en mayúsculas: “ESTA EXCELENTEMENTE OPTIMIZADO”! da placer que de entrada salga hoy dia un juego asi.
Otro acierto es el multiplataforma cruzadas, eso permite que siempre encuentres gente en los diferentes modos co op y alarga la vida de un juego.

Negativo en grande “su DLC” es increíble cómo se les fue la mano larga, pague por el juego 35 dol y te venden un DLC de pase de temporada a 25 Dol. que solo trae colores o estéticas minúsculas, soy de comprar pases de temporadas en otros juegos, pero esto de aquí es un arriba las manos y una porquería, ojala mejoren en ese aspecto.

Introduction
Space Marine 2 is the direct sequel to the prominently acclaimed game of 2011. With improvements to nearly every aspect of the original, this highly anticipated sequel seeks to push the threshold of third-person shooters with high-octane action sequences balanced with an intensive story set in the annals of Warhammer.












One century after the events of Space Marine, Demetrian Titus returns to active service with his chapter, The Ultramarines. Having spent the last hundred years serving in the Deathwatch as a Black Shield, his return is met with suspicion and hostility, but the growing threat of the Tyranids must take priority. With bolter in hand and his brothers at his side, nothing shall stand in the way as a story of deception, intrigue, and loyalty unfolds before the falsely disgraced former Captain.



A truly well-thought-out and designed storyline unravels at a relaxed pace as you traverse the enormous levels brimming with plot and entices you to take one more step until hours have passed without your notice. It is a genuinely intriguing story set in an enormous world that makes me want to learn more and delve deeper into the franchise.

Space Marine 2, at its core, is a third-person action shooter, so naturally the essence of the game is gunplay and movement.

The gunplay has been expertly thought-out to deliver clean, streamlined accessibility to loads of different guns and the ability to use them intuitively on the go. The arsenal available is substantial and provides plenty of unique gameplay mechanics that can vastly change between each type, and understanding their strengths and weaknesses is essential for progression, but there are so many choices and moments where you get to make them that you won't likely be stuck with a mistake for long.

The movement has also taken a massive quality of life improvement from the original, and while the Space Marines feel realistically heavy, they carry their weight well and can throw it around quite effortlessly and effectively. This makes movement a way to traverse the battlefield but also a weapon on its own. My only issue is that there is no way to take cover or crouch behind what cover is available, which often means you will get incapacitated quickly on the more challenging difficulties.

In addition to the lengthy campaign, you have a couple of other game modes to participate in, which vastly extend the playability.

Operations mode is secondary objective missions that parallel the primary campaign and allow you to choose classes to undertake them. These reward you with customisations and experience points varying for the difficulty you choose.



Eternal War is the player vs player mode in this game where you again get to choose the class you want to play, but you pit your skills against other players in the world for the glory of the Emperor.

Space Marine 2 is highly cooperative in its design, allowing players to pretty much do all of the activities in the game with other players. I played most of it solo, but I genuinely enjoyed the cooperative experience because it allowed me to do it at my leisure.

Because there is such an expansive amount of content to play through there is a literal plethora of unlockable customisations in the game for you to unlock and discover through exploration.

Every class has a perk tree that requires mission completions and matches to be completed to gain levels to attain them and each weapon has its own mastery and perk tree as well. This vastly increases capability allowing you to tackle harder missions and in turn, earn even better rewards.

I was genuinely impressed by the sheer volume of unlockables available, from specialty armour types and chapter paints to decals and accessories to help make the Space Marine your own.

Space Marine 2 is hands-down one of the most aesthetically pleasing games I've ever experienced. The minor and major details in this game left me awe-stricken many times over and the general visual ambience and environments just captivate both heart and imagination. With a fairly inclusive photo mode available as well, you could spend hours just playing with that feature alone.



The audio is also of sensational quality. A clear effort has been made to create immersive audio for animations, and environments as well as the sound of how visceral the game can be when you're hacking into the enemies or prying away flesh from bone. Truly one of the most gratifying experiences in gaming.

🟧 The game isn't without its flaws however, it is a hungry powerhouse for resources and running it at Ultra, I was able to hit a consistent 60 FPS at 2560 x 1440 but that's with significant dips from my FPS cap of 90.
🟨 I also had some severe crashing on day one, but that passed relatively quickly and the game hasn't crashed since.

I am far from a veteran fan of Warhammer, but having played both of the Space Marine games now I am invested in the universe and want to expand my knowledge of the world, and I think that is where this game truly shines. Not only is it a grandiose and beautiful experience in an enormous universe of story and intrigue, but it's a great entry point for beginners and while I recommend you play 1 first because they are directly connected, I don't think it necessary and can be played as an entirely individual experience. Highly recommend this game even at full price. A truly spectacular game that deserves all the high praise it's receiving and then some.",2024/9/17,en

Si vous êtes un fan absolu de Warhammer 40,000, passer à côté de Space Marine 2 serait pure hérésie.
Avec Space Marine 2, je me suis senti rajeunir, Pas de blabla inutile, juste de l’action pure et dure, sans artifice, mais avec un sens de la mise en scène, de l’esthétique et du spectaculaire maîtrisé, tout comme ces parties de plateau qui duraient toute la nuit ^^





- Le mode campagne est excellent et permet de s’habituer aux commandes (pour les fans de la licence et du 1er du nom c’est encore meilleur).
- Le mode PvE propose un vrai challenge plus difficile et surtout on s’amuse avec nos partenaires de jeux !
- Le PvP est pour le moment très bon aussi et équilibré mais à voir dans le futur.





Le respect de l’univers Warhammer 40.000, techniquement et visuellement irréprochable, un système de combat brutal, un véritable respect à tout ce que construit Games Workshop depuis des années, d’abord grâce à sa réalisation épique et léchée, chaque décor traversé subjugue par son respect envers la licence.

L’histoire est riche et immersive, respectant fidèlement le lore établi tout en introduisant de nouveaux éléments captivants.

On ressent véritablement la pression et l’urgence de chaque mission, la camaraderie entre frères d’armes, et la détermination inébranlable de Titus face à l’adversité. La bande-son, épique et martiale, accompagne parfaitement chaque moment de gloire et de désespoir.

En conclusion, Space Marine 2 n’est pas seulement un jeu, c’est une expérience. Une plongée dans un univers sombre et fascinant où chaque victoire est arrachée au prix du sang et du courage. Pour l’Empereur et l’Imperium, je recommande ce jeu à tous les fans de Warhammer 40k et à ceux qui cherchent une aventure inoubliable.",2024/10/1,fr

A 3 Minute Review of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. An incredibly satisfying and highly detailed sequel. Support the channel, become a member!


Written Review
Space Marine 2 is a highly-polished and satisfying sequel to the original 2011 game.

This is one the coolest looking 40K games I've played. It truly immerses you in its grimdark world with its stunning environments, attention to lore, meaty audio and intriguing narrative.

The game comes with three modes, the first being the campaign, which is playable solo, or in a 3 person squad with friends. It follows Titus, the protagonist from the first game, as he embarks on missions to take out a new Tyrannid threat.

Each of these missions have you fight through a variety of level layouts with their own unique aesthetic. As you progress the campaign and explore slightly off the beaten path, you'll gain access to a decently-sized arsenal of weapons that come with unique movesets and playstyles.

Space Marine 2 trains you to continuously juggle between ranged and melee combat, as different enemies will have different weaknesses that you need to take advantage of. Ammunition is more scarce than you might expect, and you won't be able to take out an entire horde purely with your guns.

There are many bigger enemies that fight you up-close, and parrying their attacks, and breaking through their defences with your melee weapon can prove to be your most effective means of taking them down.

Melee combat feels great, and comes with a good number of combos and freedom. It also has a very important role in keeping you alive, as executing low-health enemies grants you some armor and regenerates recently-damaged health.

This dance throughout combat was incredibly satisfying to me, and as you get better at it, you really feel empowered. Despite this, it felt like I could die in any fight. I was often barely hanging by a thread by the end of combat, at least on the game's recommended Veteran difficulty. Missions are long and arduous, but in a good way, and due to this continuous struggle, success was very fulfilling.

The second game mode is called ""Operations"", and is also a 1-3 player PvE mode. It includes unique missions separate from the campaign, where you can play as distinct classes with their own unique abilities. The cool part here, is that there is some meta progression. As you play, you can upgrade your weapons, put points into your skill trees, and unlock new cosmetics.

The third game mode is called Eternal War, and is your relatively run-of-the-mill PvP mode, with expected game modes like deathmatch and capture points. You play with the same class types mentioned in Operations. It can be quite fun, but in my opinion, is not the main attraction of the game.

Overall, I think Space Marine 2 feels wonderful to play, and is an absolute blast with friends. The attention to detail, and weight in everything you do really makes it a joy to play.",2024/9/9,en

The ship leaves then you are placed back on your battle barge. You then have to stand in a specific spot to trigger loading into the operation.

edit: The 3.0 patch i hoped would fix it. nope. Just made it worse now that the screen remains black after bug happens.

Insane this hasn't been fixed yet..",2024/9/13,en
Khornebrzrkr,1,86,https://steamcommunity.com/id/khornebrzrkr/,"Much like with Star Wars, when a good Warhammer game comes along, you have to hold onto it with both hands.

Space Marine 2 is not an Oscar-winning performance. The dialog in the campaign mode won't have you pondering the (super)human condition and the plot contrivances aren't all that original. The premise of the campaign is even a mirror to the original game's hook, which you could see as good or bad.

But the thing about Titus' story is that you can see the struggle he's dealing with if you know where to look. Sadly that probably won't happen if this is your first 40k game, but it IS a sequel, after all. A player with background knowledge of who Titus is as a man, and who he has to be as a space marine, can see the deep emotional turmoil he finds himself in, a man out of place after the events of the first SM game. The engaging and visceral combat, which is not keeping any secrets about itself, will have you fully believing that every big fight is for all the marbles. I particularly found myself trying as hard as I could to protect NPC imperial guardsmen wherever I found them from the hordes of Tyranids trying to reduce them to biofuel.

They also let you Paint Your Dudes. This is vitally important.

Space Marine 2 is probably the single greatest realization of what the world of Warhammer 40,000 would not only look, but move and sound like. It's had some great competition in recent years like Darktide and Boltgun, but I think this is the new pinnacle.",2024/9/15,en

--- 10월 17일 패치 이후 ---
이전 5일 패치이후 전체적인 게임의 난이도가 많이 낮아졌기에 어느정도는 손볼거라고 생각했는데
개인적으로는 굉장히 불쾌한 게임이 되었음
무지성멜타의 보스에게 입히는 데미지 감소등은 그럴수도 있다 생각하고
오스펙스또한 이해할 수 있지만

결국 한국이건 영미권이건 그놈의 할만충 버러지새끼들이 입턴결과대로 너프만 있는 패치
이게 진짜 문제인게 정작 이런 할만충 새끼들은 주둥이만 털면서 게임 말아먹고
게임 좆창난다 싶으면 이새끼들은 진작에 도망가고 없는 새끼들인데
개발자란 것들이 게임을 하는게 아니라 지 딸이나 쳐치는 할만충 새끼들의 빨아주는 의견들만 보고
크 우리가 갓겜이제~ 하면서 불쾌한 패치만 골라하는데 지금이 딱 그짝이다

치명 난이도의 파티원간 거리가 떨어지면
아머가 안차는 다크타이드에서 겪었던 팀워크유도랍시고 어거지로 붙어있게 해놓는 그림을 만들어놓고서
맵의 3분의 1을 뒤덮은 똥장판을 쳐뿌려대는 히에로펀트나
뚱샤크의 좆지랄 타이드시리즈에서 맨날 찐빠내서 겹쳐서 나오는 엘리드호드마냥
겹쳐서 나오는 릭터, 레이브너등의 어거지 물량으로 피하다보면 어쩔수없이 떨어질수밖에 없는 구조를 만들어놓고
피격시 아머가 더깎인다던가도 아니고 아머가 아예 안차는 개억지 난이도를 해놓은 꼬라지

그래놓고 볼카이트, 다크엔젤 불워크 스킨등 업데이트된건 하나도 없으며
치명적 난이도의 재미있는 어려움이 아닌 불쾌함을 극복해서 클리어해도
렐릭이던 마스터포지던 어떠한 새로운 등급의 장비조차도 없는데다 ,
코스메틱이래봐야 버그인지 뭔지 언락도 안되는 문양몇개와
파워소드 스킨 그냥 기스만 존나게 나있는 마크10 뚜껑이 전부

이와중에 탄약박스에서 회복제한 3회를 걸어놓은부분도 그러려니 한다쳐도
여전히 병신같은 딜에 헤드배율이 높다해도 희안한 보정과 , 와리가리 스텝을 논스톱으로 쳐밟는 워리어등
볼터는 건트류만해도 2~ 3발을 쏴야하는데 꼴랑 3번 회복으로는 탄이 마를수밖에 없으며
상기했듯 어거지 난이도를 만들어놨기때문에 오히려 다양한 선택은 커녕
호드처리하기 편한 멜타와 플라즈마건의 픽률만 더 올라갔다
만약 여기서 볼터의 상향없이 멜타와 플건만 너프를 또 쳐떄린다면
이새끼들은 애로우헤드 새끼들과 다를바가 없는 수준확정이므로
이후에 어떻게 될지를 지켜봐야한다
현재로서는 재미있는 어려움이 아닌 불쾌한 너프질이 되어있으며
치명적난이도의 경우 특히나 이번에 추가된 박멸 미션의 경우 캐리자체가 거의 불가능한 수준으로

Einleitung

Captain Titus, als Strafe zur ""Todeswache"" versetzt kehrt zurück in den regulären Dienst. Du schlüpfst in die Rolle von Leutnant Titus, das Imperium braucht dich, die Tyrannieden und ein noch viel mächtigerer Feind bedrohen die Menschheit. Du kämpfst dich durch wahre Gegnerhorden und musst dich auch noch für deine Vergangenheit rechtfertigen.

Gameplay

Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 teilt sich in drei Bereiche auf. Als treuer Soldat des Imperiums stellst du dich natürlich zuerst der leider viel zu kurzen Story. In einzelnen Missionen kannst du deine Klasse und Ausrüstung verbessern. Der klassische PVP-Modus wirft dich dann in den Kampf um den Titel des tödlichsten Space Marine.

Zur Story an sich möchte ich nichts weiter verraten. Zwei Dinge möchte ich aber auf jeden Fall schreiben. Die Geschichte wird in actionreichen Szenen und in deutscher Sprache erzählt. Leider leider ist sie aber viel zu schnell zu Ende erzählt. Generell hinterlassen Grafik und Sound dabei und im Spiel allgemein einen sehr guten Eindruck.

Im Story-Modus kämpft man in einem drei Mann Trupp gegen wahre Gegner Horden. Die NPC Marines machen dabei einen guten Job, sie kennen den Weg, man kann sich allerdings auch nicht wirklich verlaufen, und führen die ein oder andere Wiederbelebung durch wenn Titus zu schnell in eine Gruppe Gegner gesprungen ist. Die NPC Marines können aber auch durch echte Spieler ersetzte oder konfiguriert werden. Zwar können vor jeder Mission die Waffen angepasst werden, jedoch liegen zwischen den ganzen Leichenbergen genügend Waffen und Munition herum. Hier und da ist ein Wechsel ratsam, das merkt man dann aber schon.

Zusätzlich zum Story-Modus können noch einzelne Missionen gespielt werden. Hier könnt ihr aus verschiedenen Klassen wählen und diese dann mit passenden Waffen ausstatten. Hier sind allerdings keine NPCs vorgesehen, ihr braucht menschliche Kameraden für den Kampf. Startet ihr allein eine Mission, weist das Spiel euch menschliche Teammitglieder zu und das Schlachten kann beginnen.

Der PVP-Modus ist genau das wonach es erklingt. Als wahrer Soldat des Imperators kämpfe ich jedoch nicht gegen die eigenen Kameraden!


Leider muss ich hier ein sehr dunkles Kapitel aufschlagen. Zeitweise war ich so weit ein negatives Review zu schreiben und Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 nicht zu empfehlen. Wer bis hier her gelesen hat, weiß, dass mir die Story sehr wichtig ist, blöd nur, dass Spiel in so gut wie jeder Sequenz abgestürzt ist. Es galt also das Spiel neu zu starten und wieder bis zu dieser Stelle zu spielen um die dann wieder eingespielte Sequenz überspringen zu können.

Dass der Lendenschurz und sogar das Metallschloss am Arm von Titus im Fahrstuhl, der sich sehr, sehr langsam bewegt, nach oben geschleudert werden, ist gegen die Abstürze natürlich nur eine Kleinigkeit. Ich fand es aber lustig, daher wollte ich es nicht unerwähnt lassen.



Top erzählte Story
Gemetzel ohne Ende
viele verschiedene Waffen
gute deutsche Sprachausgabe
super Grafik


regelmäßige Abstürze der Zwischensequenzen
viel zu kurze Story






Eine Toll erzählte Geschichte mit sehr guter Grafik und einem Top Sound inklusive stimmiger deutscher Sprachausgabe. Besser kann die Schlacht um das Universum nicht geführt werden. Doch halt! Ohne die Abstürze wäre es natürlich noch besser. Ich habe das Spiel auf zwei Rechnern und mit mehreren Grafikkarten getestet, leider ohne Erfolg. Ich empfehle das Spiel dennoch und werde hier schreiben, ob das Problem behoben ist.",2024/11/18,de

Lu λ,1,39.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GORDOCOMPUX/,"Este juego es una maravilla; es posiblemente uno de los mejores títulos que haya salido este año, totalmente un 10 de 10. Este juego es un tipo Gears of War con varias mecánicas diferentes, pero en sí es igual de frenético.

Comenzando con mi reseña: La historia continúa en cierta parte la historia de su predecesor. Si bien no es necesario jugar el anterior, puede ser útil para entender ciertos aspectos de la historia. Siguiendo con la historia, esta tiene una buena forma de desarrollarse, donde cada cinemática o diálogo nuevo hace que la historia sea más atrapante. A su vez, los personajes son muy importantes en el desarrollo de la misma historia, ya que algo que me gusta que hace este juego es desarrollar bastante a los personajes del escuadrón principal, como en el primer juego, dándoles más peso sin dejarlos de lado como BOTS que te acompañan en las misiones. Las misiones, cuya característica es el escenario perfectamente ambientado que posee este juego, los gráficos y la construcción de escenarios de este juego son hermosos. Los escenarios son lineales, pero poseen cierta construcción que te invita a explorarlos y encontrar cosas bastante útiles. Además, los escenarios son bastante intuitivos. Si bien el juego tiene una opción de brújula, normalmente no la usé por lo intuitivo que es el escenario y novedoso.
Los enemigos que posee este juego son bastante variados y están colocados muy bien en cada escenario para evitar esa sensación de repetitividad que puede llegar a dar este tipo de juegos. Cada enemigo presenta un nivel de dificultad distinto al otro, dando paso muy importante al cambio de estrategias constante y al uso constante de su sistema de parry y de esquive, sistema que se complementa muy bien con el gameplay, el cual está muy bien pulido y se siente bien de usar. Tal vez en teclado podría mejorar un poco algunos mapeos de teclas, pero están bastante bien de igual manera. Volviendo con el gameplay, este es muy parecido al de GOW, como mencioné anteriormente, frenetismo puro y duro donde tendremos opción de uso de armas a melee, las cuales poseen un sistema de combos, o opciones de armas a distancia, las cuales varían según cuál elijas. La música es otro complemento a este frenetismo hermoso de gameplay, gráficos y oleadas de enemigos. La música de este juego es hermosa y complementa muy bien el universo de WH40K.
Aunque algo que no me gustó para nada es el comportamiento raro que tienen los bots aliados y el poco impacto que pueden llegar a tener en el gameplay. Otra cosa que no me gustó tanto es que la dificultad fácil y normal se sienten muy fáciles, mientras que la dificultad difícil se siente hermosa, y la última dificultad presenta todo un reto interesante. Recomiendo jugarlo en difícil, ya que es donde más sentí que se disfrutaba el juego. Otra cosa en la que flaquea este juego es en el escenario. Cosas como los barriles explosivos, objetos útiles como munición o medkits no resaltan mucho a la vista, así como también las cajas rompibles parecen un elemento no interactuable.

De igual manera, este juego se lleva mi votación de GOTY, aunque este Wukong o Astro Bot rondando como otros candidatos, mi fanatismo por el Emperador evita que me convierta en hereje. Sin duda, una sólida obra maestra que vale totalmente la pena para todos, tanto para quienes conocen de WH40K como para quienes no. Obra maestra totalmente recomendable, es una experiencia gratificante y vale totalmente su precio.",2024/9/6,es

El combate no perdona, debes ser agresivo, pero medir los tiempos y coordinar con tus compañeros es vital. por qué en las dificultades altas (qué es donde realmente se ve las intenciones de los desarrolladores) los enemigos te van a arrollar si no te andas con ojo. Todo se reduce al análisis que haces y ver donde te conviene llevar la pelea dadas las circunstancias.

I'm a Night,1,120.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/4611686018483226585/,"Итак, вы любите ультранасилие? Я да. А вселенную вархаммера? Я просто обожаю.
Но давайте я попробую сделать первый взгляд, немного абстрагировавшись от этого.
ПРЕДУПРЕЖДЕНИЕ: Букв будет много.
Для начала мой сетап и предустановки игры:
• Ryzen 5-2600
• RTX 3060ti
• 8 гб оперативной памяти
• Монитор 16:9, Эпик геймс предустановлен
• Выставленный игрой пресет графики «Высокое», под себя ничего кроме чувствительности мыши и кнопок не менял
• Уровень сложности - Высокий
А теперь к делу и по пунктам.
Оптимизация. Первые семь часов, полёт нормальный. Никаких проблем, вообще, ну вот совсем. Просадки кадров нет, стабильный fps в районе 50-60 кадров, изредка в особо больших сражениях ощущались проседания, но они пропадали так же быстро, как и появлялись. Что на моей системе при высоких настройках, а так можно было что ли?
Графика, так как это очень субъективный пункт буду краток. Это очень красиво и не режет глаз, чего я боялся, когда ждал игру.
Геймплей, старое доброе ультранасилие, что-то взяли из первой части, ввели модные добивания и БОЖЕ ИМПЕРАТОР КАК ЖЕ ЭТО ХОРОШО…. Кхм, простите, большой арсенал для умерщвления жуков, как на дальней, так и на ближней дистанции, оружие на мой вкус ощущается очень хорошо, не Destiny конечно, но достойно. Кровь кому-то может показаться мультяшной или вареньем, но меня это не смутило, моих боевых братьев тоже, в процессе напротив при погружении оно и не замечается вовсе. Игра достаточно хорошо соблюдает темп и вовремя чередует геймплей от нарезания фарша в лесу к неспешной прогулке по узким коридорам. На текущий момент всё что я видел не вызывает отторжения, а наоборот буквально вызывает сильное желание сыграть ещё.
Сюжет, а что сюжет, 7 час игры, рано ещё.
Немного о ПВП. Это неожиданно, здорово? Ну, то есть, вы скорее всего видели тизер пвп, там это выглядело немного неуклюже и аляповато что ли? Но когда ты сам туда заходишь, ууууу, подержите мои трусы, это динамично, интересно и (НА ДАННОМ ЭТАПЕ) выглядит сбалансированным (можно я просто промолчу о баласе лобби, это фикция, в остальном нормально). Штурмовики после первой части, конечно, стали менее мобильными, но это как по мне к лучшему.
Пока что как будто бы никаких минусов? Давайте это исправим и пробежимся по минусам, которые бросаются в глаза:
• Прогресс сюжета если вы играете с друзьями, остаётся только у хоста. То есть, если вы закончите игру и захотите продолжить, а игроком, на котором все собирались, были не вы, то извольте начать оттуда, где остановились. Этооооо, очень странно. Лично для себя я это не могу отнести к минусу, т.к. уже вижу, что пройду сюжет ни раз и не два, но для кого-то из вас это может оказаться критичным.
• Нестабильность сети и вылеты (опять же на данный момент). На данный момент вас может выкинуть в процессе игры из лобби. Если выбросит, то на автоматическое переподключение можете не рассчитывать и придётся вбивать код лобби, если человека нет у вас в друзьях. Но если вы как истинные боевые братья занесли друг друга в френд лист, то кнопка присоединиться к игре более чем работает.
• Управление, Да, для кого-то по первой это действительно может быть минусом, так что я настоятельно рекомендую при первом запуске подобрать кнопки под себя. Иначе ваше впечатление об игре может быть сильно испорчено.
Да в принципе то и всё по минусам на 7 час игры. Рекомендую ли я игру?
Для этого давайте разделим ответ на два.
Для вахафагов – ОДНОЗНАЧНО МАТЬ ЕГО ДА
Для всех остальных – Зависит от вашей любви к ультранасилию и визуальному стилю этой игры. Если вы из тех людей кто любит игры по типу Gears of war (без привязки к части), Doom, и Good of war именно за их боевую составляющую, то тоже да. Если нет, то я не уверен, что вам понравится. Есть ещё вариант поднять флаг, чтобы потрогать игру совсем плотно, но я вас очень прошу, если она вам понравится, покупайте. Такие проекты нынче выходят редко.
Ещё добавлю один момент, чтобы прочувствовать игру я бы рекомендовал первое прохождение:
a) В кооперативе с кем-то, так игра чувствуется совсем по другому, а в соло вы и так успеете сыграть.
b) Высокий уровень сложности. Так игра даёт вам вызов, с которым, я уверен, вы справитесь и это, будет более захватывающе.

Ну, вот и всё, много вышло для первого впечатления, не забывайте, что игра сейчас в раннем доступе для предзаказавших золотое издание и выше и могут быть проблемы которые, могут быть исправлены патчем первого дня. Буду ждать вас на боевой барже братья. После полного прохождения сюжета обновлю обзор.

И помните
- What's is your craft
- My craft is death

Update: ну так вот, спустя ещё 40+ часов игры сверху, в этот раз без многословия. Ребят, каждый раз как в первый, радуюсь как пиздюк которому погремушку дали, 11 из 10 по шкале великих. После сюжета тоже есть что поделать, но тут уже на ваши вкусы, для любителей визуального порно игра и по базовому ценнику уже на сюжете отобьётся.",2024/9/6,ru
cyno,1,113,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199014583812/,"Bon, j'ai un R5 5500, une RX 6600, 32Go 3200Mzh, je n'ai CLAIREMENT PAS la config pour ce jeu ET POURTANT, je ne chiale pas car j'ai eu des lag de chargement à la cinématique d'intro ou autre, mon jeu est sur mon NVME et c'est niquel, je joue en moyen et un peu élevé avec FSR équilibré et j'ai du 80 FPS.
Ceux qui se plaignent sont sans doute des démunies d'intelligence qui viennent des fameux Call of Duty ou autre fameux ""jeu de l'année"".
Un jeu ça se paramètre et AU NOM DE L'EMPEREUR, apprenez à le faire putain, le jeu est beau, jouissif, sans lag, c'est un GOTY large pour ma part.
Je joue actuellement avec un ami en Ange de la Mort et tout se passe super bien, c'est super bien équilibré et ont a pas de problèmes de lag ou crash ou je ne sais quel excuse à la con.
Focus à repousser la date de sortie, annulé leurs beta et j'en suis ravie. Voilà un jeu qui ne m'avais pas autant fait vibrer et plaisir depuis LONGTEMPS.
En bref, et je reviendrais PEUT-ETRE sur mon avis, ce jeu est un Empereur de l'Humanité/10.
Je vous laisse sur cela et je repars exterminer des Tyranids par centaines.
Bon jeu et POUR L'EMPEREUR !!!

Je reviens sur mon avis pour dire que j'ai fini la campagne en Ange de la Mort avec un ami et ceux uniquement avec UN SEUL bug qui fut contourner facilement. Ceci dit, à tout ceux qui chialent car ""gngngn c'est trop dur"" ""gngngn c'est bugué"" ou je ne sais quel connerie, achetez-vous du talent ou un ami et faite pas chier. De même pour les perf, apprenez à paramétrer votre jeu car j'ai eu UNE SEUL cinématique mal opti, rien d'autre.

Je rajoute, la campagne est un chef d'oeuvre bien plus poussé que bien nombre de jeu, je me suis émerveillé avec mon ami et même étant jeune scout dans le monde Warhammer, ce fut un régale visuel, auditif, psychologique et j'en passe durant une nuit (oui on a rush la campagne en 1 nuit chut). Dites-vous, ça faisait longtemps que j'avais pas vu des NPC se battre dans une campagne, c'était génial de pas se sentir seul héro de l'Imperium, on a eu des personnage même sans nom avec qui on s'est battu et on a adoré, ça rajoutais du volume sans que se soit sans âme, les NPC avait de la vie et ça c'est pas la plus part des guignol de studio d'aujourd'hui qui se ferais chier pour si peux. Aujourd'hui, peu de studios arrivent au niveau de ce mastodonte et c'est normal, la passion, le travail et les connaissances ont pris le dessus et l'argent est passé après, voilà pour moi des studios matures.

Je remercie vraiment Focus et Saber pour ce jeu, ils méritent mon argent et je regrette de pas avoir pris la Collector. La passion était de mise et même pour les inconnu du domaine c'est jouissif. Un immense bravo et merci à eux.
(non je ne lèche pas les boules car je sais qu'il existe les joueurs PS pour ça avec leurs """"""EXCLU"""""" donc je m'inquiète pas pour mon vocabulaire)
Ma note reste la même.
Merci pour tout.

Bon aller, je rajoute un paragraphe pour un peu d'humilité en disant quelques points négatif.
En premier, les Opérations ne sont pas faisable en privé entre pote sans qu'un pégu au micro tout droit sortie du cul d'un Necron rejoigne votre partie et se fasse défoncer. Vraiment, si c'est pour jouer avec des lâches qui chialent en difficulté 2/4 de la campagne, donnez-moi l'IA, elle est bien plus efficaces.
Ensuite, le mode en ligne forcé pour le mode Opération. Oui c'est un peu dérangeant quand on sait que ce mode de jeu est un bac à sable où les Tyranides sont moins violent que le Yorkshire de mamie en menace minime.
Après cela, et ça c'est pour les éditions Gold et Ultra. Nous n'avons pas accès directement aux armures inclu dans la Saison 1 car il faut les débloquer avec les fameux points de Réquisition...
Enfin, et celui-là est un poil plus personnel, on ne reçois aucune récompense en fonction de la difficulté dans laquelle on termine la campagne. Je demande pas un Terminator ou une armure de garde Sanguinien mais au moins une distinction, un titre, un logo je sais pas, juste de quoi se réjouir de nos efforts.
Voilà un peu d'humilité et de négatif pour prouver que oui je sais critiquer mais pas en chialant comme un jeune garde Imperial qui se fait soulever par des Eldar Noir.
Je remercie ceux qui votent positif et récompense mon avis, l'Empereur vous récompensera gracieusement, merci beaucoup. Aller, bon jeu à tous et n'oubliez pas : l'Empereur PROTÈGE !!!",2024/9/6,fr

applekwisp,0,16.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/applekwisp/,"Solid game, but in my opinion it has a lot of problems that make it hard to recommend in its current state. I completed the game on Angel of Death (AOD) solo for reference. I played all the operations coop at least once. I played a few rounds of PVP, I won't comment on that since I didn't really enjoy it.

The good is that it's a direct continuation of the first. I was happy to see show up in the game in a role that made sense. Overall the lore, environments, and audio were fantastic. The hordes of enemies were impressive and some of the set pieces were neat. Just like the first I loved using the jump jets and thunder hammer to crash down on enemies.

There were so many things that combined made this game just not that enjoyable compared to the first for me:
The game feels like it was designed for coop first and everything suffers for it. The campaign is filled with generic objectives like hold the location, press these buttons, etc. They don't feel tailor made for campaign experience but a cooperative one. Everything is forced to load to the useless battle barge before you load into an actual mission. This could easily have just been a UI menu.









I assume most of these issues could be patched for sure and some of them may actually be realistically improved. As it stands though at full price, it's a steep ask for what you get in the package. There is most certainly no longevity to the operations, they are largely static with no variation aside from where/when enemies spawn. PVP is PVP, nothing special. This is a sale game for sure. It does so much right, but the wrong stuff just makes the whole experience feel off.",2024/9/14,en

最初はイケボおじさん三人によるストーリーモードをクリアします。味方のおじさんたちが結構強いのでノーマルであれば半日～一日あればクリアできると思います。
ストーリーモードをクリアすると、クラスが解禁されて武器の強化やパーク、スキンなど様々な要素が追加されさらに楽しくなってきます。

PVPは触っていないのでなんともいえませんが、アクション好きならPVEモードだけでもかなりオススメです。

장점
1. 황제님의 이름 하에 진행되는 제노 싹쓸이
2. 물량이 이게 맞나 싶은 수준으로 밀려와도 안정적인 프레임
3. 제노와 헤레틱 뚝배기를 뚜따 해버리는 글로리 킬 시스템


1. 너무 적은 탄약, 데미지가 안들어가는 주무장, 패링과 회피만 반복하게 만드는 압박적인 구성
2. 상대법이 괴랄한 일부 몹, 이에 따라 제한되는 무기들
3. 뭘 어떻게 하라는 건지 설명해주지 않는 협동용 미션
4. 없는 패치


몰려오는 물량은 많은데 주 무장으로 사용되는 무기들의 탄약은 항상 부족하고, 근접 공격을 기본전제로 깔고가며 상대하도록 되어있지만, 난이도가 조금만 올라가도 적들이 쏟아지듯이 몰려와서 엇박으로 함께 때려패기 시작하면 패링도 회피도 못하고 맞아 죽어야함.

난이도가 높아질수록 잡몹들의 데미지도 살벌해져서 패링 제대로 안쓰던가 회피 안하고 잠깐만 멍때려도 체력이 줄줄 세면서 죽으려고함.
공격적인 플레이? 되긴 되는데 워리어, 플레임 루브릭 마린 이런거 낑기면 공격하다가 엇박 연타 쳐맞고 회색화면으로 사출되서 황제님 뵈러가야함.

이걸 해결하는 방법이 무장을 강화해야하는 것이고, 그걸 이루려면 뺑뺑이를 심하게 돌아야함
장인 등급은 금방 풀리는데, 장인등급에서는 몇렙 찍는다고 다음 단계가 풀리질 않음
그래서 높은 난이도로 나아가려면 자기 컨트롤 수준을 극한까지 갈고닦는 게 아닌 이상은 만성 탄약 부족과 패링 회피를 못해서 두들겨맞고 매번 죽기만 반복하게됨

근데 이유가 이거 뿐이면 단순히 내가 못해서가 맞지만, 이건 하나의 문제에 불과함.

어려운 난이도 안돌리면 다음 장비 해금이 안됨.
저레벨에 쓱싹 구간을 즐기면서 플레이어 레벨을 집중해서 올리고 스킬을 아낌없이 투자해야하는데, 그거에 비해서 성능이 너무 안좋음.
그래서 실질적인 성능 증감은 아티팩서 등급 무기를 착용할 때부터 체감되게 강해지는데, 문제는 이거 하나 뚫으려면 저 ㅈ같은걸 탄약 수급 없이 데굴데굴 구르면서 깨야함.

10렙 제한 월드부터 다음 단계 장비가 열리는데, 이걸 구하려면 피지컬이 그냥 미쳐서 현실 아스타르테스마냥 판단력 좋게 싸우고 빠지고 하는 사람 아닌 이상은 잘하는 사람에게 버스 받고 진행해야함.
그럼 자연스럽게 10렙 찍고도 컨트롤 안되서 자주 죽는 사람보고 무작위 파티에서 끼우고 같이 다니려하는 사람은 아무도 없어서 방은 매번 파토나고, 겜은 재미도 없고 불합리하기만 해서 욕만 나오게 됨.

이 게임은 그냥 적 피통이랑 공격력만 더럽게 높여놓고 슈퍼아머 달아서 탄약이 배로 들어가는데, 힐템 넉넉하게 탄약 넉넉하게 뿌리기만 했어도 이정도로 빡세다는 생각은 안들었을거임.
그냥 아 컨트롤 미스네 실수했네 정도로 넘어가지, 게임을 하면서 불합리하다는 생각이 들지 않을거임.

근데 적들이 미미함에서도 무더기로 쏟아져 나오면서 순전히 운빨에 의해서 쳐맞고 안맞고가 나뉘어지는 건 어렵다가 아니라 ㅈ같다 표현함.
얘들은 4.1 패치로 물량 줄였다는데 왜 미미함에서 조안스로프만 6마리 나옴?


일부 몹은 난전 중인 상황에서 상대법이 너무 괴랄하게 다가옴.
대표적인 예가 조안스로프라는 대갈빡 큰 제노 혐오체와 쿠크리 들고 패링일까 회피일까 응 다가오지마 미사일 난사 패턴을 사용하는 스카라베 오컬트 터미네이터가 그 예임.

조안스로프는 한번에 두마리가 같이 나와서 한쪽은 무적 보호막을, 다른 한쪽은 풀기를 반복하면서 공중에 떠서 사이킥 포격을 조지는데, 이걸 상대하는 방법이 원거리 공격이 가능한 주무장으로 때리는 거 밖에 없음.
그래서 타이라니드가 나오는 맵에서는 어썰트, 불워크 같이 주무장이 없는 클래스는 사실상 주변 정리밖에 해줄 게 없어짐.

부무장으로 조지면 되지 않냐구요? 플라즈마 좀만 쏘다보면 배리어 키고 체력 회복하는거마냥 암만 때려도 기스도 안남.
근거리 공격은 공중에 떠있어서 맞지도 않는데, 회피 원툴로만 피해야하는 사이킥 포격들이 엇박으로 겹치면 피하지도 못함.

이 대갈빡 제노스컴들은 정타로 회피해도 반격 피스톨이 안떠서 딜 우겨넣기도 안되는데, 크랙 수류탄 뜬거 아니면 하루종일 굴러다니다가 죽거나 죽을때까지 피스톨 탄약 낭비해야함.
아군이 스나 장인이라서 보이는 족족 대가리에 구멍을 박아넣던가 표면을 멜타로 싹 태워버려서 뼈와 살을 분해해버리는 직업이 아니면 그냥 굴러다니면서 엉덩이 흔들고 죽어야함.

이건 애초에 밸런스를 잘못잡은게 아닌가 싶을 정도로 불합리함을 강요해서, 얘들 나오면 겜 하기 싫어짐.
6개의 클래스가 각기 다른 스탠스로 공략할 방법이 있어야 합리적인 어려움이라고 느끼지, 그냥 이 클래스는 저항하지 못하고 팀에 전적으로 의존해야한다 이렇게 되버리면 근본적으로 설계가 잘못된거임.

사우전드 선 터미네이터 마린들은 좀 덜한 편이긴 개뿔 체력이 높고 근접으로 쉴새없이 때려댐.
이걸 제대로 상대하려면 패링과 회피를 극한으로 해가면서 반격 딜링으로 방어력 보존을 절실하게 하는게 아닌 이상, 몇번 두들겨 맞다보면 회색 화면으로 쓰러지는 모습을 자주 보게됨.

이게 얘만 상대하는 것도 아니고 잔고어랑 저격총 든 헤레틱들이 사방에서 체력을 쫙쫙 깎아대는데 패링일까 회피일까 하는 그런건 의미가 조금도 없고 그냥 안구르면 죽여버린다는 생각밖에 없음.
거기에 루브릭 마린 화망까지 집중되면 눈 깜짝하면 회색 화면 떠있는 걸 볼 수 있음.

미사일은 궤도가 꺾여서 엄폐물 무시하고 옆으로 돌아와서 쳐박질 않나, 다가가서 때리면 경직이라도 걸리던가 바보가 되야하는데, 슈퍼아머로 무시하고 미사일을 근처에 난사함.
나와서 날뛰게 냅두면 방 박살나는게 한순간이라서 나오자마자 보고 폭딜로 죽이지 않으면 진다고 봐도 무방함.

근데? 우리는 저열한 무기 때문에 데미지도 안나오는데 적은 슈아에 방어력 보너스까지 받아옴.
빨리 잡지 않으면 파티가 터지는 데 빨리 잡을 수단은 없고 적들은 마구잡이로 몰려와서 엘리트 몹 겨낭하는 것도 힘듬
이러니까 그냥 불합리하다는 소리밖에 안나온다고 생각함.

릭터, 레이브너는 패턴이 까다롭다기 보단 패링과 회피를 너무 많이 요구하는 몹이라 패링과 회피를 강제하는 느낌이 너무 강해짐.
이게 가만히 있다가 덥치는 상황에선 문제가 안되는데, 워리어가 둘러싼 상태에서 패링 회피가 같이 뜨면 그냥 두들겨 맞고 죽는거 말곤 할게 없음.

레이브너나 릭터의 공격 회피를 제대로 안하면 고난이도에서는 진짜로 순식간에 암살당함. 쉬운 난이도에서는 방어막 하나 정도 소모되서 자력으로 풀려나는데, 3단계부터는 방심하다가 걸리는 순간 방어막 없는 상태면 그대로 황제님 곁으로 사라짐.

그래서 얘들을 상대하는 방법이 무장을 강화하고 내 피지컬을 극한까지 연마해야하는게 기본 공략법이 되는지라, 컨트롤에 자신이 없으면 아마 이것들 상대하다가 화병나서 겜 돈주고 산거 후회하게 됨.

이게 딱 둠 시리즈 느낌으로 특정 적들을 완벽하게 공략해 나간다는 성취감을 주긴 하는데, 이게 어느 기점을 넘어가면 그냥 회피 원툴로 피하고 쏘고 피하고 쏘고만 하면 되서 단순하게 난이도만 높은거지 재밌지 않아서 문제임.

패링만 해서 되는거 없는데 알못새끼 나대네 라고 할 수 있는데
미미함 난이도에서도 회피 패링 안되면 뒤지는 걸 감안해주세요 제발
다른 공략법이 없는데 멀 어떻게 깸?


이부분은 머리 식히고 다시 썻음을 감안해주시기 바랍니다
원래는 억까만 남발하는 협동전이라고 해놓고 헬드레이크랑 바이오타이탄 기믹이 이게 맞냐고 까던 소리였거든요

사소하다면 사소하다고 할수 있는 부분이지만, 이 게임 협동전에서 편의성이 부족한 부분이 자잘하게 하나씩 있음
유물 보관소와 박멸 맵이 가장 단적인 예로 손꼽을 수 있음

헬드레이크가 나와서 불뿜는 경로가 어디에서 어디까지 해당하는지는 보고 그걸 알아야지 헬드레이크의 길태우기가 끝나면 달려서 안전한 구역으로 들어가서 숨는다는 기믹인데, 게임 한두번 해보는 걸로는 이게 어느정도인지 잘 모름

지금에 와서는 길만 태우니까 안전한 구역으로 달려! 쉬고, 달려! 하는게 되는데
처음 시작했을땐 뭔 ㅅㅂ 굴러도 쳐맞네 뭐 어떻게 피하라는 거임? 하고 생각했었음

거기다가 길에도 카오스가 계속 나오다보니 아군 있는 곳에 불을 뿜겠어? 했는데 이단 새끼들이 동료애가 없다는 걸 길태우기 맞고 알았음

그 다음이 문양 찍기인데, 이 부분은 주변을 잘 둘러보지 않는 사람이 낑기면 그때부터 개판됨
ㅇㅇ 그게 바로 나였음

처음에 스태인드글래스 빛나는 거 보고 누르라고 했는데, 당시에 친구와 이야기하면서 세계관 설명 해주느라 자막을 안보고 그냥 누르라는대로 누르고 입장하는 바람에 기믹 설명을 제대로 못봄

한 3번 틀리고서 뭘 눌러야하는거지? 하고 있다가 고개를 들었는데 빛나는 문양이 있는 걸 보고 바보가 도트는 소리 나옴

어찌보면 사소한 부분이긴 한데, 안전한 위치로 유도하는 간이 튜토리얼 부분에서 ’이걸 누르기 전에 먼저 저기를 봐라’하고 유도해주는 부분은 미흡하지 않았나 생각함

안에 들어가서 위를 보는데에 익숙해지지 않은 사람들은 옆에 나오는 카오스 잡는데에 한눈 팔리기 쉽기도 하고 잘못 누르다보면 트롤이라고 욕하고 하니 ‘이해하지 못한 사람 탓’으로 몰려가기 쉬움

근데 주위를 잘 둘러보지 않게되는 이유는 4,5,6번 미션이 퍼즐맵인데다가 특히 유물 보관소는 순차적으로 플레이했다면 4번째로 보는 맵이라 1,2,3에 대한 선입견이 생겨버린 상태라고 가정해주면 좋겠음

1,2,3 맵 모두 퍼즐이 아니라 주어진 지역으로 나아가서 목표를 달성하고 이동하고 버티고 처치하는 식의 임무로 이루어져있다가 4-5-6 번에서 퍼즐을 주니 5-6번은 4번의 경험이 있어서 안그렇다 해도 4번에서 턱 막히는 느낌을 받음

해당 맵이 유독 재미없는 구간이 많은 부분이기도 하고, 사소한 경험 하나하나가 부정적인 이미지로 변하면 그 맵을 안가게 됨

그럼 안그래도 없는 컨텐츠가 더 없다고 느껴지는 것 같음

박멸도 익숙해진 이후로는 바이오타이탄 포격하는 게 날아가는 궤적을 보고 ‘아 여기네’ ‘아 다른쪽 보네’ 하고 판단하지만, 이건 경험이 쌓여서 아는 거지 완전 처음 하는 사람한테는 알 수가 없다고 생각함

레이저 들고 조준하는 것도 이전까지 한번도 해본 적이 없어서 공방에서도 여전히 저거 어떻게 들고 쏘는지 모르는 사람이 많음

다들 이제 가물가물하겠지만, 안키우던 캐릭터 처음 들면 오른쪽 옆에 능력 사용하는 법 튜토리얼이 나옴
그거라도 옆에 띄워줬으면 공방하는 사람들도 빨리 숙지 하지 않을까 하고 생각함

누군가에겐 ‘굳이 그딴 것까지 해줘야함?‘ 일 수 있지만, 그 사소한 간이 튜토리얼 하나가 경험을 바꿔줄 수 있다고 생각하기에 이 편의성 보완이 필요하다고 생각함

얘네들이 아예 보여준 적이 없으면 말도 안하겠지만, 캠페인부터 코옵까지 얘들은 이런 간이 튜토리얼을 충분히 써먹었기에 이 부분이 부족하다고 말할 수 있음

비록 사소한 것이긴 하지만, 그 사소한 첫 경험들이 쌓이면 안좋은 감정만 남게되고, 그게 결국 유저를 떠나게 만드는 불쾌한 경험이 될 수도 있다고 생각함

그래서 이 부분에 관한 작은 튜토리얼이 생겼으면 좋겠음



4.0 패치 이후로 PvE를 ㅈ박아버린 나머지 개빡쳐서 이거 어렵다고 했더니
옆집에서 배운게 있는지 입털지는 않고 유저들이 원하는대로 들어주긴 함.

근데... 얘들은 자기들이 만든 게임을 안해본거 같음.
4.1 패치로 개선을 많이 해줬다고 하긴 하는데
미미함 난이도에서 애들이 물렁해졌다는 인식 말고는 4.0이랑 다른거 없이 물량이 쏟아져 나옴.

조안스로프는 배리어 쿨타임 10% 너프 했다는데 체감 안됨.
어차피 깡딜로 찍어누를 수 있는 사람들은 찍어누르면 그만인데
블붕이 어붕이 낑기면 응원밖에 못함.

볼터는 데미지 올려줬지만 헤드 안맞추면 체감 안되는지라 사실상 올리나 마나한 수치였고...

얘들이 자기들 게임에 문제점이 있단걸 인식하고 열심히 하려는 노력은 보이는데
이게 노력은 하는데 무능한 사람들이 있다고 딱 그쪽임.

믿을만한 상이긴 한데 패치가 똑바로 안이루어지는 찐빠가 보임.

컨텐츠는 너무 부족한데 랜덤성은 수준이 너무 얕은데 런 전략 펼치는 사람들 때매 공방 파토나는거 막는다고 테르미누스 급 카니펙스, 헬브루트, 뉴로슬로프 뜨면 이제 무시하고 튀지도 못하게 됨.

사소한 패치가 있긴 한데 이게 막 기분 좋게 해결되지 않아서 애매함.

5점 만점 중 2.7점

이 게임에서 가장 멀쩡한게 캠페인 뿐이라 비싼 값을 하는가? 하고 물어보면 고개를 흔들 수 밖에 없음.
흥미를 유발할 많은 요소랑 뽕차는 캠페인이 끝나고 나서 다가오는 건 병신같은 무기를 들고 패링만 주구장창 하다가 운 나쁘면 두들겨맞고 죽어야하는 불합리함과 불편함이 기다리고 있음.

워해머 프렌차이즈랑 스마1의 스토리를 아는 사람들에게는 최고의 선물이지만, 캠페인이 끝나고 나면 그 뽕이 서서히 옅어지면서 게임의 한계점이 여실히 드러난다고 생각함.

그러니까, 스마2 광고에 혹해서 손이 별로 안좋은데 나도 즐길수 있나? 하는 유저에겐 추천할 수 없음.
손은 되고, 어려워도 괜찮다는 유저한테도 추천하기 꺼려짐.
월드1 난이도 미미함은 즐겁다가도, 월드2, 월드3으로 가는 순간 그냥 사람 하나 병신되서 욕먹기 쉬워지는 이 게임을 컨트롤 안좋은 사람에게 추천하면 그냥 생각없는 망자의 츄라이나 다름없음.

앞으로의 패치 방향성이 어떻게 이어지냐에 따라 다르겠지만, 솔직히 캠페인을 진행한 8시간은 분명 즐거운 시간이었지만, 코옵을 돌린 나머지 12시간은 이 게임의 단점을 곧바로 파악할 수 있는 얄팍한 구성이었음.

긴 리뷰글을 읽어주신 모든 분들께 감사드리고, 부디 비싼 돈을 낭비하지 마시고 눈으로 즐겨주세요.

- J'avais adorer Vermintide 2 et très peu aimé Darktide, mais ce jeux prend tous les bons côté des deux et en fait un jeu super en TPS avec un PVP qui change de d'habitude et un PVE rejouable sans s'ennuyer ou sentir le temps long. Le seul point négatif c'est qu'on peu jouer qu'en équipe de 3 maximum. Je recommande.",2024/10/14,fr

I just wish they could make the gameplay of the campaign as varied & customizable as the Operations mode. Ops are just thousands times more fun. They had the system implemented already, but didn't do it for the campaign. At least, community mods have this covered. And glad to see the devs supporting mods officially as well.

Perroford,1,51.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gosqo2/,"게임은 재밌음. 묵직한 타격감에 스페이스 마린이라는 중갑 거구를 잘 살림. 사운드도 그에 맞게 무겁고 어울리는 분위기를 형성함. 게임 시스템은 세키로가 생각나는 패링과 가드할수 없는 공격을 피하는 익숙한 시스템이 있는데 이게 또 재미의 한축을 담당함. 묵직하게 한방 한방 넣으면서 적을 썰어넘기고 짓밟는 재미가 있음. 연출도 좋아 기존 워해머를 좋아하던 사람이든 아니든 두 쪽 다 만족할만한 퀄리티를 제공함. 그래픽도 좋고 최적화도 잘됨.

하지만 7만원 돈 게임이라기엔 부족하게 느껴짐. 캠페인의 분량은 길지만 굉장히 반복적임. 그저 똑같이 별로 달라지지 않는 적들을 죽이고, 이동하고, 문을 열고 의 반복임. 보스전 조차 정예 적들의 강화판일 뿐이고 최종 보스를 제외하고는 전부다 다시 반복으로 나오는데다 필드 적인 이상 패턴도 몇개 안되 몇번 싸우다 보면 금방 반복적임. 적들 종류조차 적어서 지루하다고 까지 느껴지는 곳도 있음.

가장 최악은 원거리 적들인데 게임에 등장하는 원거리 적들은 전부다 화력도 강력한데 근거리 적들 만큼이나 체력도 많고 경직도 잘 안먹고 플레이어가 가진 대부분의 원거리 화기는 쓰레기 수준이라 호드 정리 말고는 안되고 중간급만 되도 경직도 안먹어서 원거리 적과 화력전을 하면 손해를 보는 상황까지 나옴. 추적성능도 좋아서 굴러도 두세발씩 흘려서 맞기 마련이라 결국 피해가 누적되기 마련임. 이중 가장 씨발소리가 나오는건 조안스로프 인데 한마리가 나올때마다 개발자 부모님 안부가 한번씩 궁금해지는 적임. 죽음의 천사 기준 체력도 탄창 2~3개 박아야 그로기에 들어가는데 공중에 떠 있어서 상대할때 다른 적들을 볼 수 없게 만들고 가불기 투사체를 연속으로 던져대는대다 심지어 주변 적들을 강화까지 해줌. 심지어 이 새끼들은 대부분 두마리씩 짝을 이뤄서 나오는데 이 둘이 엇박으로 투사체를 던지기 시작하면 피하기 바빠 딜할 시간조차 매우 적게 만듦. 극후반 플라즈마 인시너레이터나 라스 푸실을 얻을때까진 초근거리 무기인 멜타 라이플을 빼곤 제대로 경직도 없고 화력도 병신 수준이라 원거리 대처가 안되는 원거리 무기들로 인해 더 크게 다가옴. 체력 회복 수단도 극도로 적은데 원거리 비율도 적지가 않아 게임에 피로감이 쌓이는 주 원인이됨.

절대로 추천하지 않는건 이게임을 어려운 난이도로 하는것임. 게임의 완성도는 좋지가 않아 아무리 봐도 고난이도는 테스트를 안해보고 출시한걸로 밖에 안보일 정도로 무성의함. 위의 원거리 적이 매우 크게 다가오는데 총은 더 쓸모가 없고 후반으로 갈 수록 원거리 비율은 늘어남. 만약 적들이 서로 산개해서 총질해대면 지옥을 맛보게 되는데 아군 AI는 뇌사 수준이라 T로 핑을 찍어도 관심도 안주고 심지어 바로 옆에 적이 있어도 가만히 서서 아무것도 안하기도 하는데 적 AI는 대부분 나만 노리고 투사체도 나에게만 날림. 상기 했듯 체력 회복 수단도 적은데 그중 하나인 스킬은 차는 속도도 느리고 실드를 회복하려면 싱크킬을 하거나 오랫동안 안맞아야 하고 싱크킬이 타격감을 더해주긴 하나 너무 남발되면 게임의 흐름을 끊어먹는데 고난이도에선 살기 위해 싱크킬을 계속 해야하니 계속해서 게임 흐름을 끊어먹는 요인이 됨. 가면 갈수록 고난이도는 체크포인트를 억지로 미는 게임이 되 버리는데 체크포인트를 불러오면 체력, 스킬, 치명상을 다시 채워주는데 정작 체크포인트 도달시 치명상은 회복시켜주지 않기에 다음 체크포인트까지 밀지 못할거 같으면 그냥 죽고 자원을 채운뒤 다시 미는 존나 멍청한 양상이 되버림. 이 때문에 도전적이고 어려운 게임을 찾는 사람에겐 이 게임은 안맞음. 이 게임의 고난이도는 그저 불합리하고 지루함. 심지어 최고 난이도로 게임을 클리어한 것에 대한 특별한 보상이나 최소한의 도전과제조차 없는 게으름을 보여줘서 할 이유조차 없음.

즉 이게임은 매력적인 디자인과 시스템으로 큰 잠재력을 가지고 있지만 안타깝게도 에어소프트에 가까운 원거리 무기와 씨발 소리 나오는 원거리 적들, 매우 반복적인 게임플레이로 평작 수준임. 같이할 친구가 있으면 더 좋고. 워해머 프렌차이즈를 좋아하고 게임 자체 보다 워해머에 더 관심이 있다면 살만함.

황제 폐하께서 준비를 많이했네요.
게임 자체는 굉장히 재밌습니다.
캠페인의 경우 총 12시간 분량으로 나왔는데,
오함마 스토리를 애초에 전혀 모르는
사람임에도 불구하고 몰입도가 어마어마했고,
몹들을 한방에 때려잡는 그 재미는
제 탈모 초기 증세를 사라지게 만들정도로
시원했습니다.
근데 사실 캠페인보다 더 오랜 시간 즐길 수
있는 컨텐츠가 바로 작전 컨텐츠였는데,
이 게임속 작전 맵은 총 6개로 각각
난이도도 미미함,평균,어려움,무자비함
총 4단계로 구성되어있어 저는
이 컨텐츠만 거의 하루종일 하고있네요.
특히 이 작전 모드는 캠페인과는 달리,
맵들을 깨고 돌아올때마다 경험치 보상과
방금 사용한 무기 숙련도 경험치 보상
그리고 클래스 및 무기 특성트리를 찍을 수 있게
해주는 화폐 등을 보상으로 얻을 수 있기 때문에,
여기서부터는 성장의 재미도 느껴볼 수
있어줘서 저는 이때부터 더 빠졌습니다.
(나중에는 자주 사용하는 무기들을
더 높은 등급으로 업그레이드도 가능하고
또 각 무기내에 존재하는 특성트리도 찍을
수 있어서 개쎄질 수 있음)
(+ 전투맵을 돌때는 항상 주변에
상자들을 깨면서 돌아다니시길, 거기서
아머,치료제,총알 등 다나옴)

다만, 현재 평가가 싸버린게 좀 아쉬운데,
다행히 그 이유는 게임성 자체에대한 문제라기 보다는
아무런 소통도 언급도 없이
에픽온라인서비스(EOS) 프로그램이
강제로 실행되게 만들어둬서 그런데,
이 EOS가 대충 크로스플레이나 매치메이킹을
위해 사용되는 프로그램이라고는 하지만,
이게 오히려 성능 문제나 서버연결문제
그리고 게임 충돌 등 다양한 기술적
오류를 발생시킨다는 점에서 욕을
안먹을수가 없었다고는 보지만
결국 평가는 서서히 회복되리라 봅니다.
근데 저는 개인적으로 EOS문제도
문제지만 중간중간 세월아 네월아하는
로딩 스크린들이 좀 빨리 해결되었으면
좋겠네요~",2024/9/6,ko

Tabi bunu oyunda ilerleyip daha çok zaman geçirdikten sonra deneyimleyeceğim bu yüzden pvp konusuna sonradan ayrı bi başlık açmam gerekecek. Oyunun grafikleri çok güzel optimizasyonu da bu grafiklere göre normal. Oynanış elementlerine gelecek olursak da karakter ağır zırhlı bir piyade ve bunu çok rahat hissediyorsunuz.

Dövüşlerin eğlenceli ve rafine oluşu

QuiLetoKyja,1,24.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Quilk/,"L’Empereur nous protège !

L‘Histoire : 3.5/4

La Planète Kadaku est sous la menace des Tyranides, des Xénos voraces sur le point d’assimiler tout le système.
La 2ieme Compagnie d’Ultramarines est dépêchée sur place pour tenter de stopper l’invasion …

L’histoire de Warhammer 40k : Space Marine 2 se déroule 100 ans après le premier volet, sorti il y a 13 ans. Il n’est pas indispensable d’avoir joué au premier pour suivre l’histoire même si c’est mieux (lire un résumé sur internet vous aidera). Pour le reste, les fans de W40k seront aux anges avec l’utilisation soignée du lore et des références de l’univers. Les profanes pourront peut-être se perdre un peu, mais prendront un grand plaisir à se plonger dedans s’ils ne sont pas rebutés par un univers dur et emplis de violence.


Ici, place à l’action, de bout en bout, un peu à la manière d’un Gear of War. La campagne principale n’est pas longue en soit. Mais elle vous emmène sur un rail d’action du début à la fin, entrecoupée de cinématiques vous transposant dans l’action et dans l’histoire.
Jouable au clavier/souris (vous allez rebind vos touches très probablement) ou à la manette (il est plus probable que le jeu ai été pensé pour ce périphérique dans ses contrôles), l’action vous embarque sur du tir à distance, du corps à corps, de l’esquive, de la parade, du contre, des exécutions/finish, etc… On s’emmêle parfois les pinceaux au début entre les esquives et les parades (signalées respectivement par un signal rouge et un signal bleu), ce qui ne pardonne pas dès la difficulté normale.

Toute la campagne est faisable en coop à trois joueurs, en revanche, et c’est clairement regrettable, celui qui lance la campagne progresse dans son histoire, mais ceux qui l’accompagnent ne progressent pas dans la leur et devront donc refaire les missions pour la faire progresser dans leur propre partie. Alors si l’on considère que la campagne ne dure qu’entre 10 et 15h, d’action pure et dure, ce n’est pas trop regrettable, mais c’est tout de même dommage qu’une progression conjointe n’ai pas été mise, surtout avec les reports qu’on lui connait.

Pour le reste, dans la mêlée, l’action est au rendez-vous. On regrettera peut-être un combat à distance un peu plus en retrait avec des armes dont les dégâts sont beaucoup trop faibles vis-à-vis de ce qu’ils pourraient être si l’on suit les règles Warhammer. Mais on ne boude néanmoins pas notre plaisir de lâcher quelques coups de Bolter Lourd ou de lance plasma, ou encore de Fuseur.
On pourra cataloguer ce titre comme étant un jeu couloir, mais le game design est tellement réussi que c’est un plaisir de le parcourir et de découvrir qu’au fond de notre champs de vision les hordes qui se dirige vers nous ne sont pas que des simples animations mais bien des Gaunts qui viendront au contact.

Enfin, outre la campagne, le jeu vous propose deux autres modes, le mode Pvp (Guerre Eternelle), dans lequel vous pouvez customizer votre personnage, ainsi que le mode Opération (PvE) dans lequel vous customizer distinctement un autre personnage pour réaliser des missions (6 actuellement) en coop à 3 (ou avec l’IA) pour en apprendre plus sur l’histoire de la campagne (missions annexes) et faire progresser votre personnage (système de progression des armes etc…). Des heures de bagarres contre les Hérétiques et les Xénos en perspective.



Ici, pas de Ray tracing. Saber a fait l’impasse sur les dernières technologies ou en tout cas les plus récentes. Il n’en demeure pas moins la présence du DLSS pour les possesseurs d’une carte Nvidia.
Par ailleurs, au-delà de ces choix, Saber a réussi un tour de force au niveau de l’ambiance et de la D.A. de son titre. Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2 transpire l’univers de Games Workshop du début à la fin, et le visuel renforce la puissance de la narration du titre.
En outre, vous ne verrez aucune différence entre les cutscene et les phases de jeu. Un vrai plaisir.
Avec une RTX4080, un i5 13600k et 32 Go de Ram en 1440p, le jeu tourne en moyenne à 95 FPS sur écran 165hz tous les réglages en Ultra.


L’ambiance sonore est inégale. En cela que le son, de base, est vraiment très faible. Tout à 100%, les dialogues sont peu audibles, les musiques sont sourdes, de même que les bruits des armes. Il vous faudra surement jouer avec votre mélangeur de volume pour régler au mieux votre expérience sonore et profiter au mieux du titre.
Passé ce détail, l’ambiance est excellente même si on aurait aimé des musiques peut être plus épiques dans les phases cruciales.
Le son des armes quant à lui devient excellent et rend hommage à chacune d’entre elles.


Techniquement, le titre est très propre. Aucun ralentissement, aucun freeze, aucun plantage ou bug à déplorer.
La VF est super propre.
On soulèvera tout le moins deux détails : des temps de chargements trop réguliers et assez long, même sur SSD ; et un 95 Fps avec une config musclée ? Un peu gourmand non ?. Au-delà de ça, le jeu souffre de quelques soucis de matchmaking pour les opérations.
Cela étant, le lien avec l’Epic Games n’est pas obligatoire, et n’est nécessaire que pour les joueurs désireux de jouer avec les copains qui auraient le jeu sur la plateforme Epic Games. Sinon ce n’est pas nécessaire et cela peut être passé sans soucis.


Warhammer 40000 : Space Marine 2, s’il n’invente rien, offre une narration exemplaire et un plaisir total dans l’univers de Games Workshop du début à la fin. Le Mode Opération et le PvP sont là pour faire durer le plaisir. Avec une D.A. excellente, il saura ravir les fans autant que les profanes.",2024/9/9,fr

Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 - Review

Tuvo sus retrasos. Tuvo sus filtraciones. Tuvo todo en contra, pero finalmente está aquí. Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 es una realidad. Todo lo que cualquier seguidor del universo Warhammer podría esperar. Una explosión de testosterona. Frenético. Intenso. Sangriento. Salvaje. Ese servo armadura me recordó a Gears of War. Joder, como se lo extraña al Marcus y Dom. En Gameplay es un carrusel de alto voltaje con unas desmedidas cuotas de acción. Un festín de tiroteos para cualquier amante de los shooters. Gráficamente tiene planos fenomenales con una ingente cantidad de bichos, pero… comienza a hacer ruido cuando ponemos la lupa en sus rostros o el propio entorno. Lucen bastante genéricos. Quizás por eso el rendimiento es tan bueno. Tiene una optimización brillante. Tampoco necesita demasiado equipo para correr bien. Los niveles son más bien pasillos perpetuos. En fin, Space Marine 2 es una sobredosis de acción, tanta que dejara en coma tras unas horas. El hogar de cualquier fanático de los shooter y el terror de cualquier hemofílico.


*Bastante fiel al universo de Warhammer 40K.
*El regreso de Titus, todo un machote estoico.
*Los ejambres y las oleadas, dejan postales alucinantes.
*Un curiosa cruza entre Gears of War y DMC o GOW.
*Esa constante dosis de adrenalina en su Gameplay.
*Los modelados de la servo armadura son estupendos, pero…




*Los rostros no son de lo mejor.
*Los escenarios se me antojan algo lineales y se pierde ese sentido de verticalidad.
*Algun que otro pico de dificultad en solitario.
*Ciertos bugs o CTD como producto de la incompatibilidad con algunas versiones de MSI Afterburner.

Snake Denisovich,0,50.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lolin23/,"Небольшое разочарование.
Я с большим нетерпением ждал Space Marine 2. Мне очень нравится первая часть похождений капитана Титуса. И пускай справедливым замечанием будет то, что первая часть сохранилась очень слабо и в целом даже в далеком 2011 году звезд с неба не хватала, я все еще ее люблю и перед второй частью с радостью ее перепрошел и остался более чем доволен. И вот так получилось, что, проходя вторую часть, я словил себя на мысли, что игра буквально каждые пару часов то мне нравилась, то люто бесила. В целом, после того как я прошел полностью сюжетную кампанию, пробежал все пве миссии на всех сложностях и поучаствовал в паре пвп сражений, почувствовал, что скорее разочарован, нежели доволен проектом. И опять же, если вдруг это начнет читать какой-то фанат вархаммера и резко ущемится мнением рандома из интернета. Специально для таких я сразу напишу: я дико рад, что фанаты получили такую игру, и еще больше рад, что она оправдала ваши ожидания и вы получаете с нее дикий фан и удовольствие. Но я не фанат вархаммера и в целом не стремлюсь им стать или как-то углубиться в этот движ. Мне просто нравится первый Space Marine.


Про сюжет и его тонкости я писать не буду, ибо за многие нюансы не шарю. Вторая часть продолжает историю уже лейтенанта Титуса, которого понизили в звании после обвинений в незаконной скачке всякой ереси, по типу фоток фурри и фильмов Марвел. Вернувшись на службу, лейтенанту выдают в подчинение двух новых луна-попиков, и теперь ему предстоит воевать не с орками, а с расой космических тараканов — Тиранидами (позже по сюжету подтянутся и другие клоуны). К сюжету и его подачи у меня претензий практически нет. Стандартная история для шутера, с кучей пафоса, превозмоганий и фан-сервиса для шарящих, который может доставить удовольствие и мимо проходящему (мне доставил). А там уже, если заинтересуетесь, узнаете всё подробней самостоятельно. Единственная претензия к концовке игры, она чувствуется не как задел на продолжение, а как оборвавшаяся на полуслове игра-сервисная дрисня. Складывается впечатление, будто бы разработчик нам говорит: ‘’Узнаете о дальнейших событиях через годик в пятом сезоне, всего доброго’’.

Что меня сильно расстроило в игре — так это боевая система. Не поймите меня неправильно. Она неплохая, я бы даже сказал, с претензией на глубину и комплексность. Но, на мой взгляд, она не доработана в самых очевидных местах. Начнем с того, что больше всего вызывает у меня недоумение — это система казней и последующая награда после. Понимаете, в первой части даже на максимальной сложности игра побуждала лезть в гущу сражения, ибо, получив сильные увечья, можно было всегда резко отхилиться от казни. Да, разработчики первой части не учли, что при казни надо бы давать игроку неуязвимость, но бесперебойный отхил за счет казней это худо-бедно нивелировал. Тут же мы имеем то, что, убив что обычного глиста, что элитного глиста, игрок отхилит одну ячейку брони, которую любой слабенький мобик снесет одним ударом, а этих ячеек в зависимости от сложности от двух до трех. И, как бы влетая в гущу событий, я, делая казнь врагу, после окончания анимации сразу же теряю эту броню, ибо врагов много и местами некоторые сегменты игры превращались в хаос со спецэффектами. И ладно бы с этой броней хоть какое-то количество хп в зависимости от градации врага восстанавливалось. Но нет, вместо этого разработчики прикрутили восстановление хп из Bloodborne, то бишь когда враг наносит урон вашему здоровью, вы можете его восстановить, нанося ответный урон. Но есть пара нюансов, например, восстановление хп за счет нанесения урона идет так медленно с большинства видов оружия, что с большей вероятностью можно потерять еще больше здоровья. Из-за всего вышеописанного ближний бой чаще всего вообще невыгодное мероприятие. Врагов много, иногда парирования не работают должным образом, а некоторые враги спамят кучу ударов, и все это превращается в натуральную клоунаду. С ‘’карательным выстрелом’’ все то же самое, только у него окно невосприимчивости урону еще меньше, из-за чего его иногда использовать не просто невыгодно, но еще и опасно для здоровья.

Также в компании сделан упор на кооп. Только вот самих кооп-ситуаций в игре просто кот наплакал, и чаще всего вы просто втроем будете отстреливать орды врагов и бежать вперед. Уж простите, но для меня это вообще не является основой коопа. Единственные ивенты для хоть каких-то совместных действий — это небольшой сегмент с жуками, в которых один игрок отгоняет их огнеметом, а двое других его прикрывают, и небольшой сегмент, где Кайрон немножечко быканет и отделится от отряда, и Титусу с Галадриэлем нужно будет его прикрывать. Ни разделения на роли, ни каких-то прям уникальных ситуаций, кроме обороны какого-нибудь объекта с прочностью, в игре нет. И это печально, а если играть в соло, то боты супер тупые, я такой глупый ИИ не встречал давно. И что странно, разработчик даже не додумался дать возможность соло-игроку отдавать приказы своим ид*отам. Из-за чего они чаще годны только в роли губок для впитывания урона.

Ну и в игре вообще нет запоминающейся музыки. Где тот самый саундтрек из первого трейлера, где эпичный женский хор и просто мощнейший оркестр? Настолько пресной и однотипной музыки, которая теряется на фоне общего звукового сопровождения, еще поискать надо. За это отдельный дизреспект. В тот же Darktide можно играть только из-за еб***его саундтрека.

Кооп-миссии вполне себе, но хотелось бы побольше командного взаимодействия, как в четвертой миссии с Хелл Дрейком. Это прям то, что надо. Но вот баланс вооружения прям расстраивает. Большинство оружия в игре — бесполезный мусор. Почти в каждой катке со мной бегал солдат/авангард с «Мельтаганом», бастион с плазменным пистолетом и поддержка с, по сути, таким же «Мельтаганом». Ну и еще иногда снайпер с лазерной винтовкой. Все остальное вооружение либо слабое, либо вовсе мусор. Я, играя за солдата и бегая с болтерами, просто а***вал, сколько нужно всадить патронов в элитных мобов. Когда на экране бегает 10 космодесантников Хаоса, где чтобы убить одного надо всадить около обоймы или больше. Я не понимаю, как можно получать удовольствие от геймплея в таком случае. Нужны срочные правки баланса (и нет, не надо, как ид*оты на разработчиках Helldivers 2, нерфить оружие в пве, бл*ть, игре). Ну и кооп-миссии хоть и прикольные, но надоедают очень быстро. Их мало, в них нет каких-то модификаторов сложности или того, что немного меняет геймплей, как в том же Darktide. Из-за этого всё превращается в рутину с практически похожими друг на друга катками.

Ну и техническая часть игры просто ужасна. И я сейчас не про оптимизацию. А про бесконечные загрузки в лобби, херовый пинг, постоянные дисконнекты и прочий абсурд. Доходило до смешного, что, проходя в очередной раз операцию, я с двумя рандомами прошел уже половину миссии, и тут игра просто перезапускает задание сначала. Наше негодование в тот момент надо было слышать. И можно говорить, что ‘’вот разработчики всё поправят’’, оно, может быть, и так. Но лично меня за***ло уже подобное слушать и терпеть. Я, б**ть, за игру 5500 отдал.


Подводя итог, мне бы хотелось отметить, хоть и игра меня разочаровала, назвать её плохой у меня язык не повернется. Ибо у неё есть куча достоинств, которые я также бы задолбался расписывать, как и её недостатки. Просто для меня всё вышеописанное оказалось критичным. И именно из-за этого я не могу получать от игры полноценное удовольствие. Я бы поставил ей нейтральную оценку, но увы (Вольво, прошу, добавьте). Хотелось бы еще рассказать про пвп, но, быть может, это как-нибудь потом в другом месте. Оно в целом веселое, но, как и пве, недоработанное и местами технически отвратительное. В целом очень сильно ощущается то, что из хорошей игры решили сделать сервисную помойку, что ощущается во многих её аспектах. Покупать или нет, как обычно, выбор за вами.",2024/9/21,ru

III_DarkAngel,0,12,https://steamcommunity.com/id/III_DarkAngel/,"This is another one of those games where I really wish there was a neutral option for Steam reviews.

My review is based off of a solo campaign completed on veteran difficulty, all operations completed and a decent amount of multiplayer.

Space Marine 2 is a large step up from it's predecessor and improves on almost every aspect of graphics and gameplay. The controls are familiar to anybody who's played games that require timing and elevated awareness. At the beginning it stays true to the lore to a point but quickly starts to suffer from ""main character syndrome"" as the story progresses. The multiplayer offering is interesting but not enough to keep me coming back for any length of time.

I understand the hype surrounding the title but I can't really get my head around why nobody is discussing the game's very obvious shortcomings, at least in my opinion.

The longer I played the story the more I started to realise that the structure of almost every single mission is identical to the last. The layout of almost every mission is as follows; Begin after a short cutscene, run through a linear level and kill groups of enemies, eventually you'll hit a large area which is handcrafted to show off the games ""swarm engine"" which is basically a point defence for a couple of minutes which was painfully obvious that it was ripped straight out of World War Z (especially the enemies climbing on top of one another to reach you at the top of a high wall and the whole 'hitting the base of the tower to make them collapse mechanic'). You proceed to the end then watch another short cutscene, rinse and repeat for between 8-10 hours. Pretty much the entire bulk of Space Marine 2 is defend this objective, defend that objective, defend the next objective or fight a boss in a small arena area. Another section it shamelessly ripped off from another game was the dodging debris left and right as you thrust around the screen identical to Dead Space 2 and 3. During the campaign you unlock six side-missions known as Operations which take place alongside Damocles Squad in the timeline of the main story, this is also something I couldn't quite understand, this mode has decent amounts of customisation, skill trees, weapon trees, currencies and unlock paths... to play on only 6 short missions with no variation, hmm. I played all of these once and seen no reason to come back to play them again since I knew the story and what to expect, I also found that progression does not carry over into your campaign character so I was really trying to find out what the purpose of this mode actually was, jury is still out on that one.

The multiplayer isn't something I'm really going to comment on because some people love it in games, others just don't bother with it, I'm of the latter.

Overall the story was... okay. The characters are well voiced and interesting in their own respects until you realise that literally half of the campaign is just your squad mates bickering back and forth about how much of a traitor you are, which in the grand scheme of things makes sense but after hours of hearing it I just began to get irritated and closed off from it. Toward the end of the story there is so much plot armour and so much main character syndrome I just ended up sighing when the credits rolled, feeling more bored than accomplished.

Just a side note before closing; I'm curious why instead of taking part in these epic final battles toward the end and physically fighting my way through, I was instead forced to sit and watch a handful of short cutscenes, one even held my hand and forced me to move in a certain way in order to progress while I literally just sat back and watched my character move on his own. Strange, it's almost like they were trying to rush through it to finish the game in time but I could be wrong.

In summary, I think that Space Marine 2 is a visually impressive title and should definitely be commended for bringing the Warhammer 40K universe to life in the way that it does but for me personally it simply doesn't bring enough to keep me interested for any length of time and once the story is completed and all the operations the only replayability I found was in the multiplayer which personally I have no interest in myself.

Ultimately it verges into a not recommended from me with all the negative points considered, if I could give neutral reviews, I would for this one.",2024/9/30,en

Kohelet,1,86.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/barkid/,"Лучшая игра по 40к

Радует, что российские разработчики не разучились делать игры: питерское отделение Saber подарило нам шикарный экшон.

Атмосфера ворхаммера воссоздана удачно - тут и дредноут, мгновенно крошащий орды вражин, и расстрелы дезертиров, и одержимые псайкеры, и всеобщая паранойя, которой не чужды и космодесантники. Отличный дизайн локаций: готики хватает, есть и загадочные гробницы, и искаженные хаосом пустоши.

Приятная боевая система - крошить орды тиранидов довольно весело, да и немало эпичных сцен повидаешь, где враги прут чуть ли не тысячами. С хаоситами, которые появляются позже, уже не так весело, будем надеяться, что с длс добавят и новые расы противников типа орков или некронов. Впрочем, среди тзинчитов есть неплохие боссы.

Сюжет хорош для боевичка: есть и интрига, и эпичность, финальные сцены с участием толпы ультрамаринов достойны отдельной похвалы.

В общем, бодрый боевичок, который в обычных условиях получил бы оценку ""выше среднего"". Но на фоне многочисленных провалов вроде старворс выглядит чуть ли не игрой года. Ну и по 40к стабильно выходят игры среднего качества, тут спейсмарин задаёт новую планку.

Сюжет, не смотря на то, что он короткий, достойный. Во всяком случаи в нем нет 3.14дарасов, лисбиянок и тому подобных, я только за это очень благодарен разработчикам.

К сожалению на данный момент маловато операций (всего 6) они быстро на скучивают, но вроде говорят, что добавят, будем ждать и надеяться )

以及更加离谱的特感刷新（两个利卡特+两个脑虫在一个狭小空间），还让你强制抱团贴贴打。
目前的N5三个人不满编基本要跪。
你的队友跪了，你不等队友活直接推图大概率要跪。
你在等队友活的200多秒，刷多只脑虫和利卡特的概率很高。三个利卡特你怕不怕。
子弹经常打空，两只灵化脑虫配合利卡特出击，打完刷个关间Boss。
不光如此，在N4难度下，多只灵化脑虫同时刷新的概率也大大增加了，比以前更肉了。

手柄给你，你来打。

一个PvE游戏居然嫌玩家刷太爽了，一个劲地Nerf玩家。

一般的铸币都不会设计出这样的难度来。
一般的煞笔都没有这样赤石的脑回路。

---

目前游戏内容匮乏，乏善可陈。

作为一个主打PvE的游戏，游戏的奖励机制有点离谱。你只能通过章节节点以及完成任务目标获得经验。
但是，任务途中怪物刷新是随机的，所以就会出现，可能某一局你可以全程跑酷到最后节点；某一局出现三个脑虫互相叠盾（当然，还有脑虫刷新在无法终结无法击杀的地方）。
以第一章炼狱举例，你可能在钷精炼厂域只守卫一次发电机就可以进入下个区域，也可能在下一把守卫四次发电机，修复一次起重机，最后再刷个特种敌人，比如刀斧虫。记住之前说的经验获得仅仅只是通过章节节点以及完成章节任务目标。那么你在第一种情况下3分钟通过炼狱钷精炼厂，以及第二种情况下血战15分钟获得的经验一样，完全没有额外奖励。

其次，目前的游戏平衡性十分糟糕，一大片的热熔人。近战除了回击风格的弹反人稍微可以玩一下，其他两个风格非常吃瘪。更不要提近战极其低下的击杀效率。

单人游玩的时候，等你地图都背板差不多了，在控制面板面前等AI传送也很蠢，不能考虑做一下，在只有一个玩家的情况下直接解锁控制面板吗？
同样令人感到便秘的体验在于，我非得等对话结束才能与任务元素交互。就现在的内容体量，需要打几次，任务交互点在哪，怪物在那里刷新都知道了。

还要特别批评下目前的在线联机匹配机制，离线游玩进度不保存我能理解是为了防作弊。但是，就目前而言来看似乎效果甚微。
目前对独狼玩家体验极其不友好，我已经不止一次碰到开任务匹配5分钟没有匹配成功。单人开任务，打到最后的任务节点，卡住，然后， 任务都打了80%-90%，搞这种强制匹配的逻辑，在这种情况下，你不该把我作为主机去让其他人来匹配我吗，你们开发自己不玩自己做的游戏的吗？

不得不提一些其他游戏体验糟糕的地方，比如目前存在而且频率比较高的处决动画镜头乱飘的Bug。还有先锋兵勾爪在PvE和PvP体验不一致。很难不让人怀疑，是不是因为赶工导致无法处理勾爪在PvE复杂环境的判定，所以干脆直接不让你在PvE中使用勾爪与环境交互？

最后，2024年了，这游戏也是一个加载模拟器。结合上面提到的令人高血压的转移主机，主机离开，无限载入，很好。

不是IP粉，没有固定队友都不是非常建议购买。

话在前头
本作是由欧洲两个巨头游戏公司牵头，由Embracer Group旗下的Saber Interactive工作室开发制作该作，即《僵尸世界大战 World War Z》的开发团队；由法国的浮世Focus Entertainment（原Focus Home Interactive）负责发行工作。
说到WWZ这款游戏，那自然而然就能联系到曾经他们工作室与Epic的深度合作。本次也一样，本作的联机方式依旧搭载着Epic服务器，因此在最初登录时，需要进行一次Epic平台验证。
但这个过程仅是验证，而非联动双平台启动，而且个人启动时也并未要求登录Epic账户（个人也无Epic账户），所以比起另一家法国公司的体验是要好不少的。
而这个验证服务似乎挡住了不少玩家，成为了一个游玩的痛点。
这里有这么一个方法，若是首次进入更新失败，则在任务管理器中杀掉一切带有Epic的进程，并验证游戏完整性，再开加速器对Epic平台进行加速，启动游戏再次等待更新。
更新服务进行验证这个过程，仅需一次，一劳永逸！
当序幕来到了更换掉黑色守望的披风盔甲，穿上这个标志性蓝色的极限的星际战士机甲之后，正篇开始了！

对于本作，我可用16字简评：简单难度，最高画质，流程运行，视听盛宴！

当一切射击动作游戏开始内卷关卡设计，解谜难题，潜行暗杀等流程来填充游戏内容的时候，一款经典又简洁的超猛男爽射游戏就这样横空出世了。
线性流程，讲究配合，一手爆矢，一手锯齿，一边射爆，一边锯肉。
虫潮堆叠，手雷包圆，大怪硬甲，翻滚格挡，枪决处决，回盾回能。
整整七小时的血肉横飞，血浆爆炸，肾上腺素始终运作，无脑上头！
无论是异星球环境、星际战士盔甲还是泰伦虫的模型，美工均上大分，可谓是最细腻刻画系列作品之一！
而游戏设计简单明了，超轻度的武器系统，几乎看不到的养成系统，学习成本低，操作连贯流畅，并将它区别于以“刷”为核心、强行拖延游玩时间的ARPG，是个纯粹的线性流程射击爽游！玩家需要做的，就是在对局外点技能，选职业，在对局中分配拾取武器。
如此，游戏的节奏把控更是需要精准到位，才能让玩家有着洗脑一般的共鸣，大声的喊出“为帝皇效忠”这句极为中二的话语。
而这就是在WWZ的研发经历中所获得的经验所致！同样的还有下面所讲述的游戏内容设计。
巧妙地削弱了场景中的资源补充，和可携带的弹药数量，使得游戏在潜移默化的主导玩家使用近战系统。
刀砍，可以快速清理堆叠着冲锋的小虫子；
刀砍，可以及时的捕捉到可处决的虫子，为自身回盾；
刀砍，可以更好的获得全屏血浆崩裂的爽玩体验。
若是手柄进行游玩，那将拥有更加细致的震动反馈体验！
但，同时也别忘了远程武器和投掷道具也是有用的攻击道具，因而还有枪决的触发效果。
仅仅是近和远两个攻击手段的设计，它就能够让游戏更偏向于多人向，设计出不同倾向的职业，来进行团队配合或PVP对抗。在游玩过程中，更合理的去分配资源。

“地狱潜兵”？“暗潮”？又或者“僵尸世界大战”？
或许都有，但绝非是缝合，而是经验的汲取！
这简洁的玩法、丝毫不为难玩家的关卡、敌人数量适中，关卡线性无档手的设计，以及更加有配合意义的多人合作玩法和更加细腻的视觉体验。每一项都是考虑着玩家要爽玩，要看着舒服来的。
在这个年代，你可以不玩地狱潜兵，你可以不玩暗潮，但只要你喜欢爽游或战锤40K，这不《战锤40K：星际战士2》就是最佳选择！",2024/9/10,zh-cn
Realtione etc.,1,25.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Realtione/,"Product received for free

Honestly, the first half of the campaign didn’t grab me as much as I expected. I initially thought it aimed to be a 40K [Space Marine] version of the other fellow Warhammer titles like Darktide and Vermintide but the Focus Entertainment version of them given the tricks it also borrowed from A Plague Tale and Aliens: Fireteam Elite. That would have been an overstatement for sure. Saber Interactive is turbulent as a developer but they did a solid job here.

While the Tyranid invasion dominates most of the game, and it ultimately means facing hive-mind swarms, the game flowed better once Chaos elements started to involve in the story. When you start sparring off against the Adeptus Mechanicus, the pacing improves. Although I dislike certain objectives in SM2, such as ""Hold off against the enemies until X is completed,"" they are acceptable for a standard TPS shooter campaign as long as the game flows well. And well, SM2 does flow. It features strong moment-to-moment gameplay, with frequent switches between melee and ranged combat, making it a good hybrid of hack-and-slash and shooter. The campaign also include a somewhat enjoyable final boss to end it all, intense action sequences, and varied elements like platforming and jetpack usage, reminiscent of the first game. There are even gameplay sequences involving a flamethrower against swarming rats. Sounded familiar? :)

The campaign (and by extension, PvE missions) has scarce supplies, especially in terms of aids. On higher difficulties, you need to use melee combat to fend off large groups of enemies [minoris] to conserve ammo, while also keeping an eye on Majoris enemies that provide armor upon execution. Executing these enemies requires parries and melee chains, which might remind you of Doom Eternal. Engaging in combat and switching tactics is often rewarding in SM2. My only small complaint is that there should have been a way to replenish health, similar to Doom Eternal. PvE is where the difficulty is to be more relied as you have only a few chances to be revived before you ultimately doomed to fail. In campaign even if you play one of the higher 2 difficulties you rarely worry about that and your companions are almost unbeatable because they are simply there to revive you and their health rarely goes low. From time to time I thought running a co-op campaign at the highest difficulty would have been much harder as my partner sucked more than the AI, lol. The scarcity in co-op becomes much more evident as the game would offer only 2 health packages at most although it would offer a cache to replenish ammo infinitely- again in a similar fashion to Aliens: Fireteam Elite.

PvE missions offer limited replayability unless you aim to master them on higher difficulties and grind for cosmetics. Which I really did not want to but it ends up being a personal thing. However, six PvE missions at launch isn’t too bad. Completing each mission adds another 3 to 6 hours of gameplay, which I appreciated. They had variety, though the environments and enemies are recycled. Some moments in these missions would have been great additions to the campaign (such as the Drake fight). I view PvE missions as an extension of the campaign, and with promises of more enemies and maps in the future, I hope PvE content will become more diverse and intriguing over time.

PvP was unplayable during my pre-release playthrough, and I haven't had enough time to explore it post-release. You use the same classes in both PvP and PvE, though you can customize them differently for each mode. The PvP is a 6v6 battle—far from perfect, but even with limited play, I found it to be a mode worth revisiting occasionally. Matches are quick, taking around 10 minutes, and the flow is smooth. SM2 currently lacks a battle pass or premium system for unlocking cosmetics, offering only free content and some season pass content throughout the year. So, there’s no fear of missing out. If SM2's PvP were a standalone mode, it might barely suffice, but as an addition to the main game, it feels fairly generous. It’s reminiscent of beloved 2010s multiplayer modes that came with a campaign, like TLOU’s Factions if you take a moment to recognize how beloved it was for a simple additional mp mode.

The visual fidelity and art design are standout features in this game. SM2 effectively captures the depth and the scale of Warhammer 40K universe with some of the most visually pleasing environments I’ve seen, despite being set in a war-torn setting. There are almost no janky parts, and everything executes well, including the execution animations. The bloodbath during intense combat is gratifying, and the sound design is excellent, with each weapon having a distinctive sound that enhances the experience of firing a bolt carbine to a multi-meta or swinging a thunder hammer.

The optimization isn’t the best, but I managed to get 40-50 FPS most of the time with a 3080 Ti/12700KF setup, playing on High presets with DLSS set to Balanced. I’ve seen worse, so I’ll take it.

本作代表了战锤40K世界观下改编游戏最棒的一代，无论是游戏画质还是动作设计，都非常亮眼。不仅拔高了战锤40K这一IP在玩家心中的地位，制作组还向玩家们再次展现了其游戏工业水准之高。

在本作中，玩家将扮演一名阿斯塔特（泰图斯），带领自己的小队，完成不同的任务职责，和自己的修士兄弟们狠狠的挫败来自泰伦虫族和奸奇的阴谋。剧情整体流畅，人物塑造相当出色。请注意，以下隐藏文字涉及剧透：总的来说，剧情非常出色，就是有点短，单人剧情时间约在6小时左右。

PVE合作模式可以看成是单人战役的延伸。在单人剧情中，背景通讯会告诉玩家，有别的阿斯塔特小队正在协助我们，而PVE合作模式正是协助玩家完成单人战役的那支小队。玩家可以从多种角度去体验同一任务背景下的战斗。这一点类似于《生化危机4》中的里昂线和艾达线，同一背景下发生的不同战斗，相辅相成，极大的加强了玩家的游戏代入感。但较为可惜的是，目前PVE合作模式存在一定BUG，例如难匹配、难进入对局等问题，且肝度较高，希望佩剑能在9月9日游戏正式上线前解决这一问题。

·极高的游戏工业水准
·花样繁多的动作设计
·优秀的剧情设计、人物塑造
·身临其境般的战场氛围塑造
·精彩的史诗级演出贯穿始终
·足具特色的双线程剧情体验

·单人剧情量不够大
·可选择的武器、装备较少
·PC端优化较差，对于低配置电脑不友好
·合作模式难以匹配、AI队友有待优化
·合作模式难度忽高忽低、经验计算方式不合理

游戏刚开服，存在许多影响游戏体验的问题，等一下，我成付费测试员了？？游戏时不时的卡死、无响应、永远加入不了的服务器，确实较为影响游戏体验，且本作对于电脑配置的要求颇高（非常吃显存），电脑稍微差一点，这B优化，直接完蛋。你这样，我怎么效忠帝皇呢？？？佩剑，说话！！！（byd，是不是没有安抚服务器机魂？）游戏毫不吝啬的使用了大量好看精美的CG，但你也不能直接把即时演算砍了吧？且较为遗憾的是，目前游戏中可使用的武器装备过少，一把动力剑从序章砍到结尾了属于是（开玩笑的，其实没这么夸张，但武器真的很少），但还是希望后续更新能弥补这些遗憾。还有一点就是动辄辗转40分钟的高强度战斗令我感到有些许劳累（回头人类改造计划带我一个。

国区249RMB的标准版定价，对于普通玩家来说，有那么一点点贵了。但考虑到极其流畅的战斗体验，以及无与伦比的战场氛围塑造，按6小时通关计算，一个小时约合41.5RMB，就当看了一场超绝电影，作为半个锤粉，个人认为还是值这个价的，毕竟本作代表了战锤40K旗下改编游戏的最高水准。
我一般不太喜欢对游戏给予购买建议，但这次例外。
如果你是战锤40K的忠实受众，那么不必多说。
但如果你看这游戏挺有意思的，但并不了解战锤40K的背景故事，那么推荐在B站搜索“达奇上校”，该UP的主页中有对于战锤40K非常详细的背景故事介绍。看完如果能get到点，那就买！反之，如果get不到，那么我建议不买或是打折再考虑。因为本作是改编游戏，所以如果了解一定的战锤40k背景故事，能极大的提高游玩体验。

能让玩家从头爽到尾的战锤40K改编游戏神作，虽有瑕疵，但仍瑕不掩瑜，后续的内容更新我个人暂持观望态度，希望佩剑不要学隔壁司马箭头，我花了钱，是来爽的。你一不给我看扔子，二不给我爽，你让我怎么心甘情愿的掏钱？希望后续更新的内容能如本作的单人战役一般，给玩家带来心旷神怡的虚浮体验。

Arcy,1,71.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RoboticCamelid/,"Product received for free

While it doesn't run as well on my 4070ti as I'd like, this game kicks utter ass. It feels, genuinely, like a game from 2010. Both in good and bad. A singleplayer/co-op campaign, a PvE operation mode that has its own separate progression from it but ties into it narratively, and a pretty solid, no-frills-all-skill PvP classic arena-esque modes. A full package.

I almost forgot what it felt like to have a game release as a full package. Nowadays most games release with either the solo experience, completely a PvE coop one, or are PvP only. Most in the former camp have, at best, a small DLC of a mission or two to look forward to, and the latter is a microtransaction hellscape of every-other-month season passes. But here comes Space Marine 2, of a franchise I dismissed until recently, to give me it all. Visceral PvE combat against swarms of Tyranids both in campaign and the PvE operation mode (for a Halo nerd, seemingly very akin to Spartan Ops from 4) and the ability to shoot people's virtual, heretical avatars. And yet they promise more content to come, with a grand amount of customization to make your own little Imperium soldier spaceman.

I'm not going to say it's perfect. There's 6 PvE missions and as many, if not less, PvP maps and modes. But given the success so far and how good the final product is regardless, I'm going to put my faith we'll see that extra content. The season pass isn't a 10$ gate to a cosmetic progression system like everything else post-Overwatch, but rather the early 2010s version of a Season Pass. Which is to say, ""Give us 40 bucks and we'll give you the rest of our content later. Nebulous content we can't exactly assure you the quality of, but hey, it's coming regardless"". 10 years ago that version of a Season Pass was scummy, but maybe my will is eroded. I prefer that infinitely to 10 bucks for battle royale skins every 3 months. Like I said, it's a game that feels directly lifted from the early 2010's, and balance, especially in PvP, can feel a iffy (why can Bulwarks block my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bolt Sniper).

It makes up for it way more in what it offers though, and promises more to come in Marine Chapters and PvE/PvP content, a horde mode, et cetera. Easily a GOTY 2024 contender, and that's not just because it's been a light year. You'll swap from playing Gears of War third person shooting to Arkham countering and melee bashing on a dime, and cover yourself in excess gore as you do it. Easily recommended.",2024/9/10,en

Alekde,1,386.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alekde/,"Space Marine 2 jest bez dwóch zdań jedną z najlepszych gier w uniwersum Warhammera 40K. Jest grą na którą czekaliśmy naprawdę długo bo aż 13 lat po bardzo dobrej części pierwszej. Z pochyloną głową od razu przyznam że grę ograłem w lipcu kiedy to nastąpił jej wyciek ale że od razu wiedziałem że i tak kupię wersję pełną w wydaniu maksymalnym to trochę mnie to usprawiedliwia :) Po prostu nie mogłem się doczekać …

Kampania

Kampania części drugiej jest bezpośrednią kontynuacją losów naszego bohatera z części pierwszej mimo że między nimi mija około 200 lat. Jest zrealizowana z oczekiwanym rozmachem i idealnie wpisuje się w ramy całego uniwersum. Krew, wykończenia czy odrywane członki to coś co definiuję wojnę w tym świecie. Mimo swojej liniowości i korytarzowej budowie oraz nastawieniem na to samo czyli ciągłą walkę ukończenie jej sprawiło mi wiele radości.



Świetnie ujęto i wykorzystano model walki wielkiego kolosa. Od samego początku inwazji Tyranidów widać kim gramy i kim sterujemy. Nasi elitarni bracia z legionu Ultramarine na tle zwykłych żołnierzy wyglądają jak prawdziwi tytani. Nie tylko wyróżnia ich zbroja co wielkość naszych postaci, prawdziwych gigantów równych Tyranidzkim wojownikom. Siła z jaką walczymy, poczucie broni ręcznej i strzeleckiej zostało oddane perfekcyjnie szczególnie jeśli gra się na dedykowanym padzie (ja używam XboXowego). Każdy cios, każdy postrzał czy headshot jest odczuwalni i daje nie małą satysfakcję. Krwawe wykończenia to przysłowiowa kropka nad i.



Pierwszy przemiłym zaskoczeniem jest dodanie kooperacji w grze. Poza pierwszą misją prologiem wprowadzającą następne misje możemy rozegrać wspólnie z jednym lub dwoma znajomymi. Działa to znakomicie i jeszcze bardziej podbija emocje z wspólnego grania. Na szczęście jeśli gramy sami AI naszych towarzyszy sprawdza się znakomicie.



To jest przysłowiowy deser. Jeśli ktoś pamięta poprzedniego Space Marine i zawarty w grze model multiplayera to do dzisiaj się lekko uśmiechnie. Był świetny i dostarczył mi wielu godzin świetnej rozrywki. Minęło 13 lat i dostaliśmy to na co wszyscy czekaliśmy. Dla samego MP warto kupić Space Marine 2.

Seer,1,242.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hellothisisdog/,"I'm amending my initial review in the wake of the 4.1 patch. Snippets of the original review will be referenced below for the sake of continuity (not all of it, because character limits), but reading the original won't have been necessary.

Bottom line up front: if you're a fan of 40k, really like co-op PvE games, and don't mind dropping 60 bones on a game that's light on content right now, you can probably go ahead and snag this without being too disappointed. If you aren't described by all three of those points -- definitely wait for a sale. Honestly, you're probably better off waiting for a sale even if you're fine with all that.

Changing my review to a recommendation, with some caveats. The core of what's here is solid, but there are enough negatives that I have to add some points of caution to that.

Starting with the positives: the game good. Some of the guns are still somewhat lackluster in spite of recent tweaks intended to buff their viability in later difficulties, but it's still possible to get through the highest difficulties with anything on the table. Gunplay isn't the highlight here though -- melee is where SM2 shines. If you run parry-centric builds in souls-likes, you'll be right at home here. While there are non-parry focused melee weapon options available, one of the chief mechanics players rely on is recovering armor (think of it as a regenerating shield) through executions. It is also possible to recover armor by parrying small enemies that attack you (""minoris"" enemies, as the game terms them) -- so being able to parry efficiently is one of the main ways to stay alive in this game. It's a blast in co-op, and frankly that's where I've spent all but two or so hours of time in this game.

I'm not the biggest 40k fan, but from everything I've seen they've been true to the lore of the 40k universe. This is likely because GW is intensely protective of their IP, and had granular input on seemingly pointless details like the specific look of ankle armor for the Space Marines. If lore accuracy is important to you, you'll appreciate this game.

All that said...there are some issues that are still in play.

Out the gate, the content for the game is fairly thin. The Campaign mode can be completed in roughly 6-8 hours if you're taking your time or still learning mechanics, and the Operations mode (where I suspect most players spend most of their time -- at least, that's the case for me) has 7 different missions right now. Each of those missions can be finished in 30-45 minutes, depending on how thoroughly you scour the environment for items. There's a PvP mode, but it's seemingly an afterthought that was just bolted on, because there's only three maps available there, and balancing there is .

In fact, the dev team for Space Marine 2 with the concept of balance in both PvP and PvE. Part of the furor over the 4.0 patch was due to changes that nerfed the existing meta strategies, without providing alternatives, effectively destroying the power fantasy aspect of their power fantasy game. Recent changes have moved the needle more towards this being an actual balancing effort, but there's still work to do.

Example: in my initial review, I had complaints about nerfs applied to the melta bomb -- a single charge grenade type deployable that was being used to deal massive amounts of damage to Terminus (mini-boss) and larger enemies. The approach taken by the devs was to reduce the damage these items do to those enemies by 70%. Thus, a melta bomb does just about nothing to a mini-boss, but a krak grenade will still take away chunks of its health -- and you get two krak grenades per pick up.

As I stated previously -- there's already a mechanic that limits the amount of damage a melta bomb can do, and it's called ""item rarity."" You start a round with three frag grenades. If you get a melta bomb, it's because the RNG saw fit to give you one. A melta bomb is supposed to be a big, nuclear option tool used to deal with big hordes or big enemies. If it can't do that job, what incentive do we have to take it?

Another issue is that this dev team has a habit of making changes to the game without documenting them. The problem here is that if the community has no idea what changes have been made to core elements of gameplay, it's going to be impossible for players to provide meaningful feedback on those changes, leaving us to just guess or go off vibes that something ""feels different."" If you're shooting from the hip and making changes to your game without telling people what's getting tweaked, you're setting yourself up for public outcry, and you deserve every ounce of grief you get in response.

fact, the dev team is fairly bad at communicating with users n general. Prior to the 4.0 patch, the community was told that the upcoming changes would include a new map, additional cosmetics and a new weapon. The map dropped, but the other items are still MIA, and so far as I've seen, the devs have not provided any information clarifying a different release date for these items, or an explanation for their absence.

Finally, there are still a handful of ""little"" problems that take away from the whole experience. I still occasionally see a bug where weapon XP is not properly allocated to the weapon used during a mission, meaning no progress is made towards unlocking the next quality tier for that weapon despite a successful run. Various classes and weapons still have useless (or borderline useless) perks, some of which can outright kill a player. The netcode has improved, but random disconnects are still a thing. Players on both AMD and nVidia cards have reported crashes at various times in the game's life cycle: at launch, AMD cards were having issues, but recently it seems to be nVidia users getting the short end of the stick. There's also the issue where if you're joined with a group via matchmaking and your preferred class is already being used, you're forced to pick another class (without an accompanying opportunity to make sure you've got an appropriate weapon load out for the map you're playing).

I'm having a good time with this game, obviously -- the number of hours I've played is plainly visible here. But I can only recommend this game with caveats. If you love 40k, like co-op PvE games, and don't mind dropping 60 bones on a game that's light on content, grab it. You'll have fun, and you can certainly squeeze plenty of hours out of repeating the Operations missions. I have.

If all three of those descriptors don't fit you though...wait for a sale. Just wait. I can easily see people getting a case of buyer's remorse buying this at 60. In all honesty, I'd recommend you wait even if those DO describe you. There's a good game here, but I can't say it's completely worth the price of admission right now. I don't exactly have buyer's remorse myself, but neither am I glad I spent that money.",2024/10/19,en

WeeHammy,1,36.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156021248/,"I have been wanting to play a sequel to Space Marine since the first game launched in 2011. To finally be able to play the sequel to it was fantastic! I love everything about Space Marines and the game in general so I bought the Ultra Edition of the game instantly so nothing would be spoiled for me via the internet.

Was the wait for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 worth it? Is it a good game? Is it a worthy successor to Space Marine (1)? Yes. Yes it was and I am glad I paid to play early because I loved and still am, currently loving everything about the game. Below I will explain why I am loving Space Marine 2 but first, a quick disclaimer!

This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on.

⚫In terms of optimisation - the game has no lag, stutter, fps drops, freezing e.t.c. Space Marine 2 is technically not out yet as of writing this review (paid to play early) and the game runs smoother than butter. Is this because Denuvo DRM is not on the game? Probably.
⚫The visuals/Graphic are beyond AMAZING and even on low specs, they look stunning.
⚫Fighting off the THOUSANDS of Tyranids that are coming to turn you into a bloody gore pit on the floor was PHENOMENAL. Watching them make the ""pyramid"" to climb up the walls and you punch, shoot, crush, stomp - OBLITERATE them from the face of the planet... the gore, the blood, the animations... all of which are so spot on.
⚫The game has a LORE-ACCURATE art direction which ANY 40k fan will respect and to top that off the lore is accurate and faithful to true canon lore. Compared to some ""recent"" 40k games - Space Marine 2 is the BEST Warhammer game to be released in over a decade.
⚫The combat system is stellar. Ranging from melee weapons to ranged weapons that work so fluently together in the heat of battle. Doing the melee combos to stun and then being able to point your gun - executioner style to kill them... felt so good.
⚫Enemy variety will keep you on your toes almost at all times. Not only are they ""unique"" they all have their own behaviours and abilities which will put your skills to the test of a true Space Marine.
⚫On harder difficulties the enemies seem to dynamically change their movesets (either this is true or I suck on veteran+) and, I am not kidding here, will TRULY test your skills. Harder difficulty campaign (or ops) will be a true test of player skill as you need to perfect your dodging and parrying ability because in the end - this show the true lethality of mankind's enemies in the 40k universe.
⚫The story was very well written and I enjoyed it from start to finish. It had interesting moments, moments where you would be like ""oh no"" or ""FOR THE OMNISIAH!!!"". Not only that, the characters were very well embedded in the story which only enhanced the story even more.
⚫Once you are finished with campaign missions you can play the OPERATIONS MODE (PVE) which run parallel to the base games campaign which has you playing as a different ultramarine squad that lets you level up weapons and several class's. Not only is this mode FANTASTIC, the progression feels rewarding as the longer you go, the harder it gets and more XP you will earn, ontop of that you will earn UNIQUE cosmetics that other players may or may not be able to obtain (as I said, skill based combat).
⚫If PVE mode is not your thing, don't fret! You also gain access to ENDLESS WAR (PVP) which pits Space Marines against the Chaos forces. It brings back the classic game modes such as Deathmatch which I am sure we all know how fun that was in Space Marine! Not only that, if you are struggling to get perks and weapons unlocked in PVP you can just go play PVE for a bit as PVP shares PVE's loadout customisation options.
⚫It has tonnes of content still yet to be released - look at the roadmap. Horde mode.... come on, who doesn't just want to sit and kill thousands, if not millions, of Tyranids for the Emperors name!

⚫The main issue that people are mentioning is the ""servers"" struggling at the moment - I have noticed this issue only seems to happen if you are playing COOP campaign or ONLINE modes - You can spend about 5-10 minutes on the ""loading"" screen to only realise that the game is not loading at all and this forces you to restart your game. If you are in Campaign, you will most likely loose all mission progress if you are the COOP partner or miss an important cutscene. This means you might have to replay the mission you had just played.
⚫You cannot order your AI team to do anything. Open a door. Press a button. Heal you. They are a bit ""stupid"" to say the least. Hey, no games perfect.
⚫There are no collectables or ""secrets"" to be found. Only Dataslates. I am mentioning this in cons because I feel like they missed a golden opportunity to add little secrets about ""past"" events or ""past"" games that have released.
⚫About the point above - there is no point in really exploring as there is nothing to see or find. Just the dataslates and even at that they are not really hidden at all. The maps were very linear full of dead-ends, wished there was a little more ""exploring"" to be had.

In the end, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is probably the best Warhammer game in a decade. Not only is it faithful to it's lore, it had practically no stutter, lag, fps drops at all, the animations are spot on, the characters are spot on, the world building and story writing were superb... this is what Warhammer should be like when you make it a game!!!

I wholeheartedly, after waiting almost 14/15 years for a new Space Marine game to come out... say this game should be played by everyone, new or old to the 40K universe.",2024/9/7,en

Game devs wanted to 90% focus on nerfing fun gameplay you enjoy in PvE Operations with friends


🔸 Still have enemy damage sponges that deal high health damage in higher difficulties you see in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Odyssey, forcing you to level up your class to the max level and play like Sekiro and Wo Long Fallen Dynasty (parry heavy games).

🔸 Lethal difficulty forces your Classes to really stick together counter-intuitive to the role of Sniper, Vanguard and Assault (they need positioning and at times far from teammates).

🔸 Lethal difficulty last brother standing (if your 2 teammates are down) won't let you have a redemption arc cause you cannot gain armor when both of your teammates are down.


🔸 For some reason in higher difficulties like Ruthless and Lethal, PvE Operations Space Marines that come from the Battle Barge with so many supplies then get transported by the Thunderhawk to a planet, cannot even bring 1 Medicae Stimms with them.

🔸 You cannot choose a grenade type in the Battle Barge before being deployed in PvE Operations even in higher levels but in PvP you can choose a grenade type (when you level up).

🔸 For some reason, very simple stuff like changing Helmet Lens Colors and Bulwark Flag Banner is extremely hard to do for them.


🔸 No weapons holstered or sheathed on the hip like the Chainsword you see in early trailers of Space Marine 2. Weapons disappear to thin air while doing executions like what you see in FromSoftware games when you open doors there (play Mandragora demo and see how that game lets you sheathe weapons while climbing).

🔸 Wants you to register to the Focus website to voice out concerns and ideas, many nice highly upvoted ideas and concerns there are 95% ignored.

🔸 Always changing Armor Colors, now you lose some of those colors and some colors still don't match when applied to a different armor part even if they are the same color.


🔸 Parry mechanics change: Fencing parry feels weird now and samish to Balanced. Contested health still disappears so fast, add 1 to 2 secs delay before deterioration. Can't get that health back being staggered, interrupted and busy parrying.

🔸 Same weapons just different bad stats like very slow attack speed, I read that Space Marines are supposed to be fast why are they so slow? Enemies move and dodge faster.

🔸 So many bad perks that are useless in higher difficulty, makes you choose a select few that are viable. 5% damage increase? 3% heal when you execute an Extremis? Choose a perk between 10% damage for the Tyranids and Chaos?


🔸 For some reason you get staggered and interrupted a lot even with the perks ""do not lose control while charging an attack"" and ""after being grabbed, not lose control when taking heavy hits""

🔸 Assault Class loses the ability to fly-hover, air-dash, shoot and drop grenades while flying in PvE Operations (play an Assault Class in PvP Eternal War you will know what I am talking about, when you high jump, tap the ability again to air hover).

🔸Assault Class eats 1 charge of the Jump Pack when you Dash with it instead of half a charge, Jump Pack is actually used twice during Ground and Pound (once during lift and used again during ground smash) but eats only 1 charge.


🔸 Vanguard Class loses the ability to grapple environments in PvE Operations (play a Vanguard in PvP Eternal War and you can grapple to walls, windows and ground).

🔸 Very limited pistol choices for the Sniper, Vanguard and Assault Classes.

🔸 No shield charge for the Bulwark class, even Fortnite has Captain America's shield charge.


🔸 Grindfest MMO and Mobile leveling style for each class, there are 6 classes, you have to replay PvP and PvE countless times

🔸 Their idea of padding up gameplay is grinding the same map over and over again. The Tyranid Hierophant Bio-Titan has a smoke screen but the Space Marines do not have a smoke grenade to lose enemy aggro so you can revive a teammate and range enemies to lose accuracy when you are inside the smoke?

🔸 Saber Interactive didn't really level up and evolve their talent/perk design coming from their previous game World War Z. Play other games like Dota 2, Hades 1 and 2, Astral Ascent, Ember Knights, etc. to get really good ideas for the Perks system, yours are still the boring, uninnovative, useless in high difficulty perks.




☄️ Make Perks actually great that change gameplay in PvE Operations like the Assault Class we enjoy in PvP Eternal War, have him choose among:

🔹 Ground Pound Assault Class (what we have now).

🔹 Fly-Hover Assault (in PvP Eternal War the Assault Class can fly, hover and dash in the air, shoot his pistol and even throw grenades mid-air). For some ugly reason they won't let you do this in PvE Operations. Air Assault Class.

🔹 Jump Pack Dash-Dodge Assault (does not have to be a perfect dodge, jump pack dash eats half a charge and replenishes fast (you can still hover and dash mid-air but don't have damage perks for Ground Pound and Fly Hover). Dash Mobility Evasion Assault Class.


☄️ Perks change for the Vanguard Class, let him choose among:

🔹 Perks that focus on Grappling Enemies (what we have now). Sekiro and Spiderman web zip Vanguard.

🔹 Perks that focus on Grappling Environments (walls and ground) for mobility (fast cooldown) what you see in PvP Eternal Vanguard. Escape and Close-In distance fast Vanguard.

🔹 Perks that focus on Parry and Melee combat (you already have some of these perks with the Vanguard Class). Lies of P and Bloodborne Vanguard.",2024/10/18,en

Cato Sicarius,1,78.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kemornian/,"Space Marine 2 é uma obra prima dos TPS

Uau, é realmente chocante e triste o quão banal se tornaram os motivos para se negativar um jogo em análises. Simplesmente estão colocando nota negativa à um jogo praticamente sem defeitos em tudo que ele se propõe a ser por causa de ""continha na Epic"", que nem mesmo é obrigatória para se jogar o jogo, você pode simplesmente ignorar e desinstalar, tirando o crossplay entre as plataformas... Mas enfim, vamos à minha análise:


Essa frase define a estética e energia que carrega o universo Warhammer 40k. O universo nos leva à um futuro distante onde a humanidade, após quase fracassar como espécie, obteve a ajuda de um humano especial conhecido apenas como ""Imperador da Humanidade"" e pôde começar a se reerguer e recuperar um pouco de tecnologia ancestral para dar início aos seus feitos de conquista, conquista essa NECESSÁRIA, pois a galáxia é uma floresta negra impiedosa onde outras espécies, chamadas de Xenos pelos humanos, estão em busca de domínio e garantia de sobrevivência. No entanto, o Imperador caiu, traído na Heresia de Horus, e agora, no milênio 41, o que resta é apenas a esperança de poucos Adeptus Astartes que ainda conseguem sonhar com um futuro para esse império decadente...
Toda essa ideia de um universo ""grim dark"" que sempre esteve presente em WH40K desde sua concepção é muito bem traduzida dentro do jogo, com sua ambientação grandiosa e ao mesmo tempo efêmera, com construções gigantescas que mais parecem relíquias de um passado uma vez majestoso, do que algo para se orgulhar nos dias dos milênio 41. O roteiro também passa bem essa ideia por meio de diálogos e situações que induzem ansiedade e desesperado pelos olhos dos humanos comuns e até mesmo dos Astartes, pois eles não conhecem nada além da luta, e não sabem se um dia conhecerão a paz. Como diz mesmo o voto dos Ultramarines, ""Meu voto, é serviço eterno"".


A gameplay de Space Marine 2 é uma clara evolução de tudo que já havia no Space Marine 2, com muito mais conteúdo e complexidade envolvida. Aos olhos de alguém que vá jogar em dificuldades menores, talvez pareça bobo, mas se o jogador se empenhar e entender as mecânicas para jogar nas dificuldades mais altas, este verá que funciona como uma dança no campo de batalha. É preciso diminuir o número dos inimigos menores, conseguir se distanciar desses para eliminar alguns que atiram de longe, então ter free hit para atacar corpo a corpo contra Tyranids brutos, executar esses com execuções gloriosas parecidas com as de Doom 2016 para recuperar armadura e se manter lutando por mais tempo, dar parries perfeitos para dar um tiro crítico e ganhar momentum na batalha, assim como esquivas perfeitas ou esquivas para meramente se distancias do perigo e recarregar. Há muita complexidade envolvida e não se trata apenas de correr e atirar. Sem falar na variedade de armas e seus usos para cada situação específica, assim como as diferentes granadas e habilidades táticas.
A gameplay aqui é o FOCO principal, como deve ser em um bom jogo de verdade (pelo menos para mim), e o jogo não possui problemas de ritmo e em nenhum momento perde a magia, assim como (citando mais uma vez) Doom 2016 e Doom Eternal, onde ao invés das coisas ficarem repetitivas pela ação extrema, elas ficam ainda melhores pelo aumento da intensidade gradativa, com mais momentos onde a escolha e atitude rápida do jogador vão fazer a diferença. O jogo pode ser desafiador em dados momentos, mas se vc entrar no mindset de um space marine e a força imparável que vc representa com estratégia e atitude, você escapará de qualquer situação, até mesmo de primeira nas maiores dificuldades, basta se encontrar dentro do jogo, e é isso que é tão incrível dentro da gameplay desse novo Space Marine. No entanto, isso não quer dizer que a história não seja boa.


Mesmo com a gameplay sendo o foco aqui, não quer dizer que a história não seja boa, na verdade ela é muito boa, e é contada como os antigos faziam, por meio de boas cutscenes que aparecem do nada e conteúdos extra kkkkkkkkk. O universo 40k é rico em MUITA LORE, afinal de contas são quase 40 anos de existência, com milhares de coisas nos wargames e tabuleiro, nos livros dos RPG de mesa, mais de 500 livros e histórias, animações, quadrinhos, enfim, é coisa para caralho. Mas o jogo ele faz bem em condensar a história para um contexto específico e se manter nesse contexto.
O jogo começa no mundo de Kadaku, um Hive World que está sendo atacado pela recente raça de xenos Tyranids que chegaram na galáxia, de origem desconhecida. São como insetos poderosos de rápida adaptção e evolução que agem sob um poderoso consciente coletivo chamado de Mente Colmeia, ou Hive Mind. Eles são inteligentes, miram e atacam em pontos estratégicos e não temem morrer para concluir objetivos essenciais, são basicamente uma força implacável, sem ambição ou emoções para atrapalhar, o único objetivo é consumir tudo no universo. E a partir daí entra em cena nosso protagonista Titus, que retorna depois de ter entrado em contato com um artefato de Caos (outra força do universo) e ser marcado pelos inquisidores, sendo enviado para a Deathwatch para lutar contra Xenos em diversos sistemas. No entanto, após uma gloriosa e importante vitória, Marneus Calgar ordenou o mesmo à voltar para os Ultramarines e lutar novamente por Ultramar! Daí a história se desenrola com diversos twists envolvendo Astartes traidores corrompidos pelas forças do Chaos, reviravoltas de personagens interessantes, e claro, muita sanguinolência e vingaça. Tenho certeza que a história do jogo irá empolgar muitos jogadores e inspirar vários deles a irem atrás de conhecer o universo e de repente serem floodados por shorts de lore em todas as redes sociais.


Como vivemos em uma era onde todo mundo está viciado em microdoses de dopamina, e somos todos fodidos da cabeça buscando alguma espécie de amparo em qualquer tipinho de conteúdo, apenas uma boa campanha não basta... Sempre querem mais :rottenwalker: . Então é, o jogo tem multiplayer e promessas de conteúdo novo à cada season para uma maior longevidade, onde teremos conteúdos relacionados a outros Capítulos de Space Marines, armas novas, inimigos, mapas handcrafted (nada procedural, amém), e muitas e muitas skins para os fãs fanáticos colecionarem. Mas de que se trata esse multiplayuer? Existe o multiplayer da campanha, onde vc pode jogar com mais 2 amigos para completá-la, e há ainda o modo coop de Operações, onde você escolhe uma entre as 6 classes disponíveis para completar missões difíceis no bom e velho estilo de Left 4 Dead 2, com muitas hordas chegando, e objetivos para se completar enquanto isso. Há o estímulo da repetição por meio de lvl ups das armas e das classes, com perks para desbloquear e melhorias de armadura por meio de coletáveis de nodos de armaduras e sementes genéticas. Além do modo de operações há ainda o pvp, que na minha opinião é muito bem vindo e me lembrou bastante a era de ouro dos videogames, lembrando especificamente o multiplayer de Halo. Há planos para a vinda de um modo de Horda.



Para fechar essa análise, devo dizer que de fato o jogo é incrível, para mim é como um suspiro em uma indústria cada vez pior, com títulos onde o que importa de verdade nos jogos é deixado de lado, e onde mecânicas simples e o convencionalismo está vencendo para agradar pessoas com ""arte em pílula"", pois essas pessoas estão doentes e cansadas. É um jogo que parece que foi feito em 2010 com gráficos e parâmetros de resposta na gameplay dos dias de hoje, que respeita MUITO o material original e sabe o que seus fãs querem ver em uma obra. Parabéns Saber Interactive por fazer o que estúdios maiores não estão dispostos a fazer.",2024/9/17,pt

The levels are designed around 3 players; if you're playing single player than the AI is absolutely useless.

If a game is going to force you to use AI teammates, they better be able to pull their own weight.

Multiplayer is somewhat fun, but even that falls short. Game play feels very similar to Halo Infinite, except slower, clunkier, and not as much fun. Also, Halo is free and this is full price.

Arcvox,1,24.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/arcvox/,"Space Marine 2 is an excellent sequel to the original, improving on the original game in almost every aspect. As it currently stands, I think it's a great game and represents the 40K universe very well, capturing grand scale combat zones on gorgeous alien planets. That said, it can certainly do with some quality of life improvements, which is to be expected of most new games out the gate. Hopefully they will address certain issues quite quickly, though most of these didn't affect the game in a negative way. More details on that below.

The game itself follows the story from the first game, which was a fairly basic story about the discovery of a relic which brings about nothing but trouble for the protagonist, Titus. Essentially, he is paying penance for his ""crime"" in the last game, which consists of him not dying. As a result of this, he has grown distrustful of his fellow brothers, which in turn makes his brothers not trust him - along with the obvious fact that he mysteriously vanished for the last couple of centuries. The campaign takes place over 3 planets, while certain storyline events take place concurrently with the Operations game mode, which is essentially another 6 missions in co-op mode, where you can play as a custom Space Marine.

The gameplay is pretty basic. It's very similar to Gears of War without the cover system, instead relying on stunning and executing enemies to restore your overshields. You'll be mixing up melee and gun play mopping up large numbers of basic enemies while eliminating the larger threats, which mostly consist of two large factions each with around 6-7 enemy types each, and some boss type enemies too.

Overall, I do recommend this game, however I do feel that the amount of content itself is a little bit lacking. Saber have made a very good game platform for more content to be added, and I can imagine different scenarios and missions could easily be added to objective mode. Having completed the campaign, it definitely feels as though it's meant to be played co-op too, especially with all the cool cosmetics you can unlock in the multiplayer modes. These additions I feel like would be low effort for the developer, so maybe they will consider it in the future.

Other than the small quality of life improvements and a bit of tweaking on some of the multiplayer classes, I think Saber did an excellent job, and I look forward to more content. The storyline is gripping, the visuals are amazing, and it's the sort of fun gory gameplay that we used to get a lot of in gaming, so it's nice to have a callback to that.


- Excellent visuals that brings the 40K universe to life in an authentic way.
- Captures the essence of the Space Marines in all their glory (though on harder difficulties you won't feel very powerful at all)
- Impressive horde mechanics, particularly in their movement. Climbing up walls and scrambling over each other suits the tyranids amazingly.
- Combat is fairly basic but fun, and glory killing enemies never seems to get old.


- Gaining multiplayer XP is incredibly slow, given that you'll be repeating online content a fair bit. This is exacerbated by the fact that cosmetics use the same currency as productive upgrades such as perk points. I feel like the two should have been separated so you can work towards your favorite chapter AND progress in abilities so you can pull your weight better in teams.
- Melee in particular needs some buffs, as it tends to do little damage compared to firearms.
- Harder difficulties are quite overtuned at the moment. This is especially apparent against ranged enemies, who always seem to have a clear line of sight to your team and make extremely quick work of you while in combat.
- Missing some obvious and easy to implement quality of life improvements, such as a co-op campaign mode, customisable campaign armor sets using cosmetics from the multiplayer, and weapons carrying over from certain chapters. I noticed in the campaign, Titus regularly has his default armor and weapons, which is understandable in CGI cutscenes, but not in the in-game ones. Also, I would have preferred to have the helmets on the team for the custscenes too. There is an option for this, but it only affects gameplay moments.",2024/9/17,en

Chaplain Hearth,1,86,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hearthwarning/,"Introduction

I always wanted to make my own space marine, color it, choose the chapter i want, play with but getting into the 40k Mini's is hard and expensive. But with this game you can immerse yourself in the world of 40k and be a Space Marine for US$60.

Regardless whether you're into 40K or not, if you like 3rd person shooter, fighting xenos (aliens) with 2 other people, that has a good Story Campaign, 6 different classes in Pve Operations mode, and a PVP, then this game is for you

Pros and Cons
(Pros) Immersive and great campaign mode that delves into the 40K universe (especially Ultramarines Chapter which is 40k Warhammer golden boy). (Cons) The campaign is quite short, which is less then 15 hours





So in conclusion, think it's a great game and a lot of fun to play with friends or random. This game had been a blast compared to some of the 40K games released before this, and it lives up to the first Space Marine. Whether or not this game is worth it for those who want to buy it, is up to you. After reading all the pros and cons, reading review, taking it all to consideration, is it worth your time and money? only you can decide :)",2024/9/14,en
Wuffy,0,74.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013445641/,"As it stands now I can't recommend this game at this point. I paid for the gold version, so I'm 90 bucks deep into this game. I paid a premium for it.

On the technical side of things I don't have much to say. I've got a beast of a PC and it ran well. Never had a hickup. I did have many bugs however where my camera would bug out during a finisher or be thrown across the map while doing a finisher.

I had high hopes for this, being a massive 40K fan. Especially since I would get to play a Space Marine. Or so I thought. More on that later.

Campaign:
It is alright. Not much to say on it. It is so short it is barely worth mentioning. The story is cool, I think. You get to see a couple of different factions and a pretty big ending. The power scaling in the campaign makes you feel like a space marine. Barely.

I doubt that anyone who isn't into 40k would get as much as I did out of the campaign given teh lack of ""Oh I know that!"" moments which was around 40% of the fun. Can't fault them for the accuracy, it feels pretty authentic.

Haven't played it and I suspect that not many will.

Here is where the issues lie. Given that the campaign is over if you blink too fast you'll find yourself either playing operations or PVP. With these operations you have 6 missions. Bland, uninspired. Any misconception of you playing a space marine will vanish at this point. Basic ennemies (Minoris ennemies) will delete your health faster than a guardsman falling during a Krieg assault. You feel about as durable as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient. You deal about as much damage as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient too. Oh and don't worry, you can increase your damage output from 1 to 1.2 if you reach level 25. So you can look forward to upgrading your damage to that of an overzealous toddler if you can manage to stick it out for that long.

Weapon variety is non-existent. You get maybe 4 weapons per class? A bit more if you play the tactical. Forget about playing any kind of melee class as well. You'll find yourself stunlocked. Yes, stun locked... in a horde shooter and slasher game. You missed that weird parry window? Well too bad you're dead now. Good you had that expensive Space Marine armor on right? Otherwise, you'd be dea-... oh right. Oh and don't forget that for many classes you don't even get a rifle or a melee weapon.

Sadly you are very sloooow in this game. Attacks take a financial quarter to complete only to provide diminishing returns. You have all the bad aspects of being heavily armored while not being tanky at all. Usually, games will make you slow and heavy in order to being able to take a lot of damage, and quick and nimble but able to take less damage. Not in this game. You'll take massive amounts of damage from a small critter of which there are around 30 around you at any given time aaaand be slow and deal no damage. Remember from the lore when they said ""Nothing that big should be that fast""? Yeah, must have been something the devs missed or something.

I feel like I do have to talk about this... I've seen a lot of ""skill issue"" comments brought to people who don't like the clunky combat and broken parry system. I have finished all from software games with the exception of sekiro and elden ring. So the choice is all follows: Either Space Marine 2 is harder than Bloodborne, Darksouls 1 to 3 and demon souls, or there might be something wrong with the gameplay.

I'd say buy this when it is on sale or maybe just buy another game. I hear good things about Black Myth Wukong. Strangely enough in Darktide you feel more powerful than in this game. Despite playing a prisoner under the orders of an inquisitor and not a superhuman angel of death.

This game had all my bias stacked in its favor, yet I still can’t recommend it. I played it for 20 hours, thinking that at some point the fun must start. Around any corner now. But it never came. I never felt like a space marine. And if I could refund it I would. But I’ve been punished for being optimistic. If you buy this game, expect nothing and then maybe it will surprise you by mistake.

I may revisit it if the devs rework many of the systems but we all know that it isn't going to happen;",2024/9/10,en

GedLouZe,1,22.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stereocraft/,"В обзоре в основном будут приведены впечатления от технического состояния игры, о сюжете и совсем чуть-чуть о мультиплеере
Шибко затягивать не буду, оценок ставить тоже, я же не проплаченный игрожур

Техническая составляющая игры
В общем и целом, для меня удовлетворительно. Стоит сделать оговорку, что вселенную Warhammer 40,000 я очень люблю и потому готов терпеть технические огрехи по принципу «чем бы разработчик не тешился, лишь бы бэк не трогал».
Поковырялся в настройках, что-то там накрутил навертел и вуаля, получил себе комфортные 60 кадров с просадками в особо масштабных сценах до 45, пойдет.
За время прохождения основного сюжета игры, а это, к слову, заняло у меня чуть менее 10 часов, я не встретил ни одного критичного бага, да даже условно забавных багов мною встречено не было. Хотя, понаблюдав за некоторыми стримерами забавные баги очень даже случались.
Опять же, делаем заметку о том, что это по сути «ранний доступ» для предзаказавших Gold-издание и выше, будем уповать на то, что к основному релизу разработчики техническую составляющую подтянут.
Боевая система ощущается странно, вроде бы волны врагов постоянно держат тебя на фокусе, стоит чуть отвлечься и тебя сразу же затопчут, а вроде как ты играешь за космоморяка, чувствуется его тяжесть и неповоротливость, хотя в книгах космодес мог в считанные секунды сделать такие вещи, что и представить себе страшно.

Тут все 50/50
С одной стороны, разработчики очень бережно отнеслись к бэку вселенной и каких-то поверхностных косяков я не заметил. Была пара моментов, где пришлось прибегать к помощи «пояснительной бригады» и проводить разбор того, что там пиксельные рты наговорили, ответы мы так или иначе нашли, но вот хотелось бы услышать мнения более опытных лороведов.
А вот с другой стороны нас встречает совершенно обычный, клишированный сюжет, который хоть и обладает каким никаким внезапным(!) поворотом, но все читаемо и предсказуемо, и даже скучно.
Возможного я слишком много перечитал книг по Warhammer 40,000 или перенасытился реального кайфа от того, как работает вселенная в Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, но в этой игре кроме пафоса Ультрамаринов, не ощущается буквально ничего, ни тебе воодушевления от их речей, ни тебе благоговейного страха от масштабности военной машины Империума; от окружения нет ни каких намеков на то, что ты играешь буквально за полу-бога, да немногочисленные солдаты Кадианского полка кланяются тебе (CADIA STANDS!!!), но не все, к сожалению, нет ощущения массового почитания Ангелов Смерти.
Отдельно отмечу, что, если Вы слабы по части бэка и основных каких то понятий вселенной, начало игры уже огорошит Вас вопросами, ответы на которые не столь тривиальны и придется покурить матчасть.
Операции позволяют взглянуть на события основного сюжета под другим ракурсом. Здесь мы оказывает поддержку основной группе лейтенанта Тита и по сути проходим игру параллельным путем.

Операции очень хорошо показывают те трудности, с которыми сталкиваются ""голоса из вокса"", которые так или иначе докладывали нам о продвижении своих заданий.

Но почему(!) почему(!!!) в Операциях есть прокачка, а в сюжетке нет!
Я уж молчу о том, что в Операциях и мультиплеере играются одни и те же классы, НО прокачка их ранга проходит по разному и опять же, прокачка, для ПВЕ миссий она медленная, я не думаю, что пройдя все операции 2-3 раза мы сможем прокачаться в потолок, а если и сможем, то сделаем это максимум для одного класса!
Ну ладно, немного я слукавил, некоторая косметика открывается или за прохождение миссий ПВЕ или победы в ПВП.

Я поиграл буквально час, из которых около двадцати минут боролся с «ошибками сервера», верю и надеюсь, что пофиксят.
Поиграть удалось две каточки, обе были в режиме аля «захват».
Мультиплеер играть еще более «тяжело» чем сюжет, «тяжело» в смысле здесь персонаж ощущается еще более медлительным и скованным.
За баланс классов не скажу не умею я в этом, что могу сказать с уверенностью, сейчас мультиплеер не станет Вам заменой каких-либо иных мультиплеерных шутеров, и существует лишь для того, что бы наконец-то поместиться с другими игроками в формате «космодес версус космодес»
Немногочисленные игроки довольно-таки приветливы и культурны, в чате в зависимости от стороны конфликта можно как увидеть фразы «FORTHEEMPRAHHH», так и «SKULLSFORTHESKULLGOD!!!1» и даже «WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHH!!!!»
Набегал в мультиплеере около 8 часов, общее впечатление - хорошо.

Играбельных карт, как и собственно режимов игры сейчас всего ТРИ.
Режимы игры представлены обычным дезматчем, захватом точек и удержанием точек.

Все это играется вполне себе комфортно, ощущение от ТТК приемлемое, в замесе пережить можно.
Играю пока только на одном классе (на ачивку), но прокачка класса очень долгая, хотелось бы побольше очков получать, за +/- среднюю игру с победой можно получить около 1,5-2,0 тысяч очков, а для прокачки сейчас нужно 16,5 тысяч. Понятное дело, победы будут доставаться не так часто и прокачка будет идти не быстро.
Прокачка классов дает доступ к новому оружию, элементам брони, косметике и гаджетам, прокачки перков вроде как нету в мультиплеере (что-то есть в операциях, но я туда еще не ходил).
Плюс насыпают внутриигровую валюту, за которую вся косметика и открывается. За игру можно получить от 10 до 30 валюты, анлок какого-либо элемента косметики стоит в среднем 30-40 валюты.

Если играть с друзьями то можно и какую никакую тактику придумать, с танком, саппортом и дамагером.

Обычный матч сводится зачастую к одному:
дезматч - ХОДИШ ТАЛПОЙ БОИЗАВ И ПУЛЯИШ ИЛИ СТУКАИШ ЮИДШЭК
захват точек - ХОДИШ ТАЛПОЙ БОИЗАВ И ПУЛЯИШ ИЛИ СТУКАИШ ЮИДШЭК НО ТИПЕР ПА ТОЧКАМ
удержание точек - ХОДИШ ТАЛПОЙ БОИЗАВ И ПУЛЯИШ ИЛИ СТУКАИШ ЮИДШЭК НО ТИПЕР ПА ТОЧКАМ ДЕРЖИШ ИХ СКОКАТА ВРЕМЯНИ И ИДЕШ К ДРУГОИ

Баланс классов? Не умею я в эти Ваши балансы, но постараюсь пояснить, так как играю только на одном, пятеро других классов убиваю с комфортом, нет, этот класс не ИМБА, если я влечу в толпу я конечно же получу ПАСТУК!11 если я влечу 1х1 в неудобной позиции я получу ПАСТУК!11!
Конечно же (точные названия классов не помню), бесит Снайпер с его инвизом; бесит Щитовик тем, что ставит под себя бафчик и чуть ли не вечно стоит за щитом; бесит Пулеметчик за скорострельность, жирность и энергетический sщит; бесит Штурмовик за то, что когда взлетает надо мышку задирать высоко....

Брать или нет?
Если ты такой же фанат Warhammer 40,000 и готов расстаться с деньгами – ДА
Если ты готов к экспериментам и не пожалеешь о потраченных деньгах – ДА
В остальных случаях - НЕТ

Игра хорошая, годная, по Вархаммеру, УРА
Но даже мне, фанату вселенной, тяжело ее воспринимать как законченный продукт.
Ощущается сильная нехватка тактического взаимодействий в прохождении сюжета/ПВЕ миссий
Очень долгая прокачка, почему бы не предоставить анлок нового оружия за внутриигровую валюту?
Очень надеюсь на исправления производительности, в принципе играть и сейчас комфортно, но хотелось бы по больше стабильности фремрейта.

HaRuMaJi,1,55.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/harumaji868/,"เกมที่อวยกันจนเวอร์ แต่ก็ไม่ได้เหมาะสมกับราคา แต่ไม่มีใครด่าเพราะไม่ใช่เกม Woke

ช่วงเปิดใหม่ๆราคาสูงมาก และ ด่านกับเนื้อเรื่อง ก็มีให้เล่นน้อยมากๆ คอนเทนต์ในเกมน้อยมากๆ
ราคาสูงไม่ต่างจาก Outlaws และ Shadow AC เลย แถมยังมี Epic มาเป็นปลิงเกาะให้รำคาญ
แทรกไว้จะลงเครื่องให้ได้ เหมือนจงใจบังคับให้ใช้ หรือ จงใจอาจจะอยากดึงข้อมูลอะไรหรือเปล่า ไม่รู้นะ อิอิ

ส่วนที่ชมของเกม คือ ระบบเกมเพลย์ ที่ต่อสู้ดุเดือดสนุกมาก performance ที่ค่อนข้างโอเคนะ
ดีมาก คอมสเปคน้อยๆไม่แรงมาก พอเล่นได้แหละ เล่นกับเพื่อนจะสนุกมาก แต่ถ้าคุณเล่นคนเดียว
ไม่มีเพื่อนล่ะก็ เหงาแน่บอกเลย แถมอาวุธ หรืออะไรต่างๆนาๆ ก็มีจำกัดเยอะจนแทบไม่มีอะไรให้ใช้
งงใจ คนอวยกันเป็นบ้า เป็นหลัง เพราะเกมถ้าให้คะแนน ก็แทบไม่ต่างจาก Outlaws แน่ๆ
คุณภาพพอๆกัน ต่างกันแค่เรื่อง Woke เท่านั้นเอง ใครที่สนและอยากซื้อ แนะนำให้รอลดสัก 50 เปอร์ - 75 เลย
สำหรับตอนนี้นะ เพราะคอนเทนต์น้อยเหลือเกิน ราคาแพงเวอร์มากๆ

เล่นได้ไม่นานก็น่าจะเบื่อ ก็คาดหวังว่าทีมงานจะพัฒนาและอัปเดตคอนเทนต์มาเพิ่มให้มากกว่านี้
ไม่งั้นเกมน่าจะร้างและตายไวมากๆ คาดหวังกับ Season Pass ที่จ่ายไปแล้วละกัน

โหมด มัลติ กับ PVP ไม่มีอะไรเลย ก็คือลงไปฟาร์มหาของอัพขั้นกันรัวๆ เกมฟาร์มดีๆเลย
เนื้อเรื่อง เหมือนจะยาวแต่เล่นสัก 10 ชั่วโมง น่าจะจบแล้ว เผลอๆไม่ถึงด้วยถ้าใคร Skip ฉากเนื้อเรื่องไปนะ

บัค เรื่องนี้ต้องพูดจริง เพราะเยอะมากช่วงเริ่มต้นนี้ บัคแบบติดจนทำให้ผ่านด่านไม่ได้
เวลาลงด่านนึงนานมาก นานกว่า Warhammer Dark Tide อีก
และพอติดจุดนึงตอนใกล้จบจากบัค ภารกิจไม่ถูกดำเนินไปต่อ แม้ว่าจะซ่อมเกมแล้วก็ตาม
ก็ยังมีโอกาสเจอบัคอยู่ ทำให้ต้องยอมตายกันหมดตี้ และก็ไปวนเริ่มเล่นใหม่ราวๆ 30 นาทีต่อด่านได้
ยิ่งเล่นระดับยาก ยิ่งเหนื่อยและต้องฟาดฟันกับศัตรูนานกว่าเดิมหลายเท่าตัว

รวมถึงระบบ AI ถ้าหากคุณเป็นผู้เล่น Single ที่แย่มากๆ คุณจะเหงาโดดเดี่ยวและทรมานที่สุด
ในช่วงตอนนี้ที่ระบบ AI ยังไม่ได้แก้แน่ๆมันยากมากผมบอกเลย ยิ่งกว่า Souls Like Sekiro Elden Rings Dark Souls
กว่าจะผ่านแต่ละด่านได้ด้วยระดับยากสุด ทรมานขาดใจ เพราะเกมเหมือนให้เล่นหลายคน
และ AI ทำหน้าที่ได้เลวร้ายที่สุดเท่าที่เจอมา Darktide ที่ว่า AI เหมือนไม่มีสมอง เกมนี้เหมือนอะมีบ้าของแมงกะพรุน AI

เพราะฉะนั้นรวมๆแล้วให้ 7/10 ให้เผื่ออนาคต
เพราะราคาแพงและถือว่าผ่านเพราะระบบต่อสู้สนุก
และก็คิดว่าอนาคตเขาคงแก้

เพราะถ้าไม่แก้ก็จะให้แค่ 5-6 คะแนนพอ ผ่านในเรื่องความมันส์ของเกมกับความท้าทายและหลากหลายระดับที่ผู้เล่นเลือกเองได้
และก็ชมในส่วนของการตกแต่งชุดเกราะตัวละครด้วย มันค่อนข้างน่าสนใจที่เราปรับได้แทบทุกส่วน
แต่ก็สร้างตัวละครเองไม่ได้นาจา เพราะงั้นทำใจไปเลยสำหรับคนอยากมีหน้าตาเกราะหล่อเฟี้ยวอะไร
เหมือนกันหมดทุกเกราะ ทุกคนแน่นอน ต่างแค่สีสันกับลายสัญลักษณ์ ณ ตอนนี้นะ

เพราะงั้นใครไม่มีเพื่อน แอดมาเล่นกันได้ เนี่ยพูดความจริงแบบไม่อวย
ทั้งข้อดี และ ข้อเสีย รอลดเชื่อเรา นานๆทีจะมีเกมที่เราเล่นแล้วรู้สึกว่า ยังไม่คุ้มค่าราคา
เพราะเรา Enjoy กับทุกเกมเกือบหมด ขอแค่มันสนุก ถ้าไม่สนุกเราจะรีฟันเสมอ
ไม่ก็รีวิวด่าเสียหมา แหะๆ ^_^",2024/9/13,th

(partiellement réglée à la 4.1) 1ère grosse erreur : nerf des munitions.

(toujours présent à la 4.1) 2ème grosse erreur : le nerf d'armure dans les difficultés supérieures, là c'est costaud, on prenais déjà globalement plus de dégâts dû au nombre d'ennemi qui augmente, et dans certains cas on se faisait déjà explosé comme il faut,même en ayant les bons réflexes. A la dernière difficulté, c'est complètement lunaire, on devient une vraie chips, je vois même l’intérêt, on prend cher même en se défendant bien, on est pas ""récompenser"" par le jeu en jouant bien, ca ne sert strictement à rien, c'est juste frustrant

В один момент я готов был пищать от радости, а уже через полчаса закатывать глаза в недоумении. Если вам интересно, что пошло не так, что давайте тезисно и по порядку...

...Что понравилось

✅ Зрелищная боевая система, где банально приятно пинать жуков по морде железным сапогом.

✅ Крутой звуковой дизайн, благодаря которому чувствуешь мощь каждого выстрела и на слух понимаешь действия врагов в бою.

✅ Визуально — одна из красивейших современных игр, даже добавить нечего.

✅ На удивление прилично написанный сюжет и отличная работа с повествованием через окружение, позволяющая осознать всю хтонь сеттинга.

✅ Один из лучших русских игровых дубляжей за годы.

✅ Хорошая производительность, подводившая лишь в совсем убийственные для CPU моменты (У меня связка Ryzen 5600 и RTX 4070).


❌ Боевая система механически очень быстро выдыхается, оставляя игрока с чередой одинаковых арен с врагами.

❌ Всего две фракции противников, ограниченных в уникальных юнитах.

❌ Слишком много визуально однообразных видов оружия, в которых путаешься до конца игры.

❌ Жутко неудобное управление с клавиатуры в бою при неприятном ориентировании в меню с геймпада.

❌ Неткод оставляет желать лучшего и любит кидать игрока на сервера с высоким пингом или вечно реконектить соединение через чёрный экран.

❌ Долгие загрузки даже с NVM SSD.

❌ Игра балансилась под кооператив, поэтому возникают пики сложности при игре в одиночку, ибо боты-напарники просто не обучены ничему кроме стрельбы и реанимации игрока.

❌ PvE-режим операций выдыхается так же быстро, как и боевая система, не предлагая чего-то интересней получасовой пробежки по аренам с врагами.

❌ PvP-режим будто сделан ради рофла и даже не тестировался.

❌ Излишне долгая прокачка классов в мультиплеере.


Space Marine 2 невероятно красивая и тактильно приятная игра, в которую становится неинтересно играть уже на пятый час геймплея из-за отсутствия глубины в боевой системе и однообразия игровых ситуаций. Мультиплеерные режимы в свою очередь никуда не годятся в качестве эндгейм-контента.

Overview
(In-depth analysis below)
Space Marine 2 is an exhilarating sequel that nails fast-paced hybrid combat, mixing ranged and close-quarters as you take on endless hordes of Tyranids. With a massive selection of weapons and gameplay mechanics, each encounter feels not only unique but incredibly intense and satisfying. Despite some optimization hiccups, it is still an incredible journey through the dark and gritty Warhammer 40k universe. Whether a long-time fan or new to the franchise, there is plenty to enjoy.

Positives Negatives
















The story picks up one century after the first installment. Titus now leads a squad of Ultramarines in a relentless battle against the Tyranids, a deadly alien swarm threatening humanity. However, Titus' return is clouded by suspicion—once accused of Chaos corruption, his every decision is scrutinized, and trust in his leadership is shaky at best. But as the Tyranid menace grows, survival demands action, leaving little room for doubt or hesitation.

The narrative intertwines high-stakes action with personal drama, as the urgent need to confront a devastating foe clashes with the lingering mistrust surrounding Titus' past. This completes a compelling tale of exoneration, loyalty, and relentless warfare, absorbing you in the adrenaline of battle and the depth of Titus' journey.


SM2 builds on Saber Interactive's signature horde mechanics from World War Z, refining the formula to fit within the chaotic, action-packed Warhammer 40k universe.
The extensive arsenal of weapons offers diverse gameplay mechanics that can alter your playstyle significantly, capturing the visceral intensity of 40k battles with brutal executions and massive gunfights against swarms of enemies. Though a few quirky design choices from WWZ persist, like the absence of jumping, long button presses for actions, and lackluster AI companions that cannot be adjusted, these qualms of mine are minor in the bigger picture. The overall experience remains highly engaging, fluid, and, most importantly, fun.

Each Tyranid has unique abilities and attack patterns, meaning you cannot just rely on the same strategy for every encounter; you'll need to adapt your approach as new threats are introduced. This keeps the horde mechanics fresh with increasingly complex enemy variations. Boss fights are particularly thrilling, often demanding quick thinking and precise movement, and are a welcome change of pace.

Mobility plays a crucial role, and much like weaponry and combat, it feels fantastic. You can sense the weight of the hefty armor, making traversal satisfying—especially when utilizing mobility-orientated abilities like the jetpack. However, the absence of a cover system or the mere ability to jump forces you to rely on frantic dodge-rolling and the riposte mechanic to avoid being overwhelmed amidst the hordes you face; while fun at first it can become quite repetitive.


Alongside the already impressive campaign, additional game modes are available at your leisure that can be enjoyed alone or with your fellow brothers. The Operations mode offers supplementary missions set between the campaign events, where you can choose from six classes, each with unique playstyles, loadouts, and abilities. Completing Operations rewards you with XP, unlocking new weapons, class, and weaponry upgrades, and the ability to customize your Space Marine. Lastly, Eternal War presents a 6v6 multiplayer mode where you can test your skills against others in the name of the Emperor if a competitive thrill is what you desire.

Altogether, SM2 offers a wealth of content, from raw content alone and experimentation across different classes and weapons extending replayability, with a solid sense of progression and customization. Plus, Saber has already released a robust roadmap, promising even more future content, both free and paid.



The environments span towering Gothic cathedrals and industrial wastelands to the desolate expanse of space, each grand in size and detail. The battle-scarred power armor of the Space Marines and array of weapons are rendered in striking detail, a sharp contrast to the grotesque, bio-engineered forms of the Tyranids, all of which soaked in the oppressive atmosphere of unending war, heightening the tension and chaos of combat. With dynamic lighting, explosive effects, and visceral melee animations, every visual element enhances the epic struggle for survival that is Warhammer 40k.


The audio design as a whole is superb, with each weapon producing a distinctive, hefty auditory punch that highlights their power and impact in combat. This is further complemented by immersive ambient battlefield sounds and compelling voice acting, creating a rich and engaging auditory landscape. The OST is exceptional, greatly enriching the overall experience. It features a mix of intense, atmospheric, orchestral arrangements to craft a dynamic soundtrack that adapts seamlessly to the gameplay, heightening emotional tension during intense battles, and even the calmer moments.",2024/9/28,en

Playing on veteran (intended difficulty) fails as delivering the power fantasy of mowing down hordes of foes and brutally destroying worthy foes with consummate skill. The armour generating mechanic works but even horde enemies do so much damage it is often depleted immediately. The health regen mechanic just doesn't work - constantly getting downed, scrounging for medicae packs and spamming ultimate ability as much as possible just get some health back the core game play loop. Titus feel sluggish and the enemies are too bullet spongy. The combat just feels 'off'.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Review
Después de muchos años desde el lanzamiento de la acción original de los Marines Espaciales del mundo futurista de Warhammer, la secuela ha llegado. Te llena de adrenalina, pero también puede traer la frustración de morir a menudo. Afortunadamente, no tienes que estar solo para luchar contra las hordas enemigas, y en compañía de amigos, tus posibilidades de tener éxito y, sobre todo, de sobrevivir son mayores.

El personaje principal es el marine espacial Demetrian Titus, que era el personaje central de la primera parte y entonces todavía era capitán. Después de ser acusado injustamente de corrupción, es reasignado a la acción, pero después de ser degradado con el rango de teniente. Después del desembarco de entrenamiento al comienzo de la campaña, ya no lucha solo, sino en compañía de los marines Chairon y Gadriel. Al jugar solo, sus roles serán asumidos por bots, que pueden luchar decentemente y te revivirán cuando sea necesario, pero no puedes dirigir sus acciones y no esperes una cooperación más cercana. Afortunadamente, puedes reemplazarlos invitando a otros jugadores antes de ingresar a una nueva misión.

Directamente durante la campaña en la base, desde donde te transportan al área de la misión, puedes saltar y jugar operaciones PvE separadas o enfrentarte a otros jugadores en el modo PvP de Eternal War con los objetivos de capturar territorios, capturar con control y aniquilación. Sin embargo, dado que recibimos el juego antes del lanzamiento, fue prácticamente imposible encontrar oponentes vivos, pero al menos tuvimos suerte en las operaciones.

La ventaja de la campaña es la elección de la dificultad y el guardado automático del progreso en los puntos de control. Entonces, después de agotar las vidas o el número de resurrecciones cuando caigas, continuarás desde el último punto de control. Por el contrario, cada operación termina inmediatamente después de tu muerte (cuando progresas con compañeros de equipo en vivo después de la muerte de todo el equipo) y luego debes volver a pasar por todo de nuevo. Además, las operaciones son bastante difíciles y no llegarás muy lejos con los bots, aunque suelen revivirte.

Por otro lado, en las operaciones, puedes elegir la clase de tu personaje: hay seis de ellos para elegir, desde táctico, pasando por francotirador, hasta pesado. Incluso si fallas, ganas experiencia, niveles y nuevas ventajas por separado con cada enfoque utilizado. Aunque solo uno de ellos puede estar activo, pero definitivamente beneficioso en combate. Además, puedes cambiar de equipo en la armería de la base, donde desbloqueas nuevas armas, así como sus variaciones avanzadas. Además, puede personalizar la apariencia y las partes individuales de su cuerpo: casco, charreteras, placa pectoral, etc.

Lo interesante de las operaciones es que complementan la trama de la campaña, pero no es necesario pasar por ellas. Por ejemplo, sucede que Titus y su equipo deben cumplir el objetivo principal en el planeta, y al mismo tiempo otros tres marines deben llevar a cabo una acción de distracción de apoyo. El paso de Titus es necesario para la continuación de la campaña, pero puedes ignorar la acción de distracción o jugarlo en cualquier momento como parte de las operaciones.

En las misiones, progresas en diferentes entornos, tanto en interiores como en exteriores, pero siempre es una forma de corredor. Por lo tanto, solo puedes caminar por las calles demarcadas y no tienes la oportunidad de moverte libremente por la zona. Los objetivos son inicialmente bastante diversos, pero luego se repiten. Probablemente la más interesante es la protección de las cadenas de los ascensores o transmisores que intentan comerse a las criaturas voladoras. En el camino, recolectas municiones y equipo adicional, puedes cambiar de arma en los puestos. En lugares predeterminados, interactuará con los objetos seleccionados. Utiliza interruptores para activar mecanismos, abrir puertas o arrancar el ascensor, romper una barrera, etc.

Puede tener dos armas con usted, una de las cuales es un arma de mano más pequeña y, además de ellas, también un cuchillo, un martillo o una espada de energía. Al disparar, puede usar el zoom, donde la cámara cambia de la vista en tercera persona a la primera persona y puede enfocar el objetivo con mayor precisión, o incluso cambiar los modos de arma. En el combate a larga distancia, usarás diferentes rifles y metralletas con diferente alcance, precisión y cadencia. Sin embargo, la munición debe usarse con prudencia, porque es bastante limitada y los suministros no siempre están a mano.

En los ataques cuerpo a cuerpo, literalmente cortarás todo y usarás ataques de área más fuertes, que son un placer para diezmar a los tiránidos. Finalmente, cuando la víctima está temporalmente inmovilizada y se ilumina en rojo, para poder ejecutarlos. Las ejecuciones no solo son impresionantes a la vista, sino que también complementan instantáneamente algunas de tus armaduras. Se agota cuando se daña, y luego los enemigos te quitan la salud. Esto se puede restaurar parcialmente, pero usará estimulantes para una recuperación rápida. Otro accesorio útil son las granadas.

Space Marine tiene gráficos decentes con soporte DLSS y efectos y componentes estándar. La apariencia es agradable, principalmente debido al gran diseño de los sitios con atención al detalle. Se trata de hermosas vistas, por ejemplo, de una base militar, donde, además de tu equipo, también puedes ver a otros secuaces y unidades del emperador disparando a hordas de tiránidos que se ciernen a lo lejos. Y cuando saltas a la acción y eres asistido por un tanque, la atmósfera y la experiencia de combate son muy intensas. Sin mencionar que los fanáticos acérrimos del universo de Warhammer 40K también deben estar muy impresionados por los elementos auténticos, el procesamiento de armaduras, unidades y estructuras.

Space Marine 2, para un fan de Warhammer 40,000, es un sueño hecho realidad. Aunque no hace falta ser un ávido fan o haber jugado al capítulo anterior para apreciar el juego, lo cierto es que se ha hecho con el debido cuidado pensando en las personas que aman la franquicia y les habla con referencias muy específicas y con algunas sorpresas. Con Space Marine 2 puedes esperar una acción de pasillo sencilla con hectolitros de sangre, ubicaciones bien diseñadas del universo de Warhammer 40,000 y mucha diversión en compañía de otros jugadores. Al jugar en solitario, puedes disfrutar de unas 10-12 horas de campaña con una historia, pero el resto es casi injugable sin compañeros en vivo, aunque se pueden usar bots. Las operaciones cooperativas con amigos son excelentes, adrenalina, sin ellos aburrimiento y muerte rápida. Y PvP es para medir las fortalezas y habilidades de los demás. Por lo tanto, Space Marines 2 sobresale en el avance en modo cooperativo y la campaña tampoco se puede desperdiciar y no tienes que haber crecido en Warhammer para disfrutarlo..",2024/9/6,es

С серией «Warhammer 40,000», я долгое время был незнаком, часто о ней слышал, она всегда была где-то на фоне, но проходила мимо меня. В какой-то момент, меня заинтересовал покрас миниатюр, и пришло время наверстать упущенное, и погрузиться в «мир далёкого будущего, где есть только война!». Я начал читать, смотреть, играть в игры «вселенной», и меня затянуло в «Варп». При этом называть себя тру фанатом, всё же язык не повернётся, я, скорее любитель сеттинга, и с этой позиции постараюсь поделиться своим мнением по данной игре.

Стоит отме«Тит»ь, первая часть, вышедшая в 2011 году, была пройдена мной несколько дней назад, впервые, соответственно имея свежие впечатления, незамутнённые 100-летней службой в «Карауле смерти», и ностальгией, мне будет, с чем сравнить.

«Ортодоксия»:

• Графика: я понимаю, что в наше время практически все крупные проекты, обладают красивым визуалом, но «Святая Терра», какая тут проделана работа: с окружением и детализацией, текстурами и освещением, с какой любовью и уважением. «Император одобряет!».

• Атмосфера: постепенно продвигаясь по сюжету, всё дальше в глубины «Хаоса», градус накала растёт, словно «примарис», в процессе «генетической аугментации», а твоя челюсть, моментами просто отваливается, как у поверженных «тиранидов», добиванием «цепного меча». Масштаб и эпичность сцен, будто сошедших с картин, поражают воображение, и, наверное, нигде я не видел такого количества объектов в кадре, движущихся словно лавина. Необычное чувство причастности, в этом великом крестовом походе, всего «Человечества!».

• Музыка: буквально с первых секунд появления экрана меню, первое, что ты слышишь, это густой и обволакивающий, яростный и величественный, саундтрек главного меню игры, тебя сразу сковывает, будто цепями, и ты сидишь, затаив дыхание, в ожидании эпической истории, невероятных сражений, настоящего испытания твоей выдержи, и прочности братства «Ультрамара!».

• Геймплей: боевая система, построена на стрельбе, и ближнем бое, с сочными добиваниями врагов. В арсенале имеются «болтеры» разных видов, ножи, мечи и молоты, а так же несколько типов гранат и тяжёлое оружие. Стрельба приятная, пушки разнообразны и по-своему хороши, в определенных ситуациях. В ближнем бою, в нашем распоряжении, слабые и сильные атаки, уникальная способность, блок и парирование. Битвы с боссами, и крупными врагами, позволяют на полную раскрыть все возможности этой системы. Поначалу сложно попадать в тайминги, но постепенно привыкаешь, и, почувствовав вкус крови, начинаешь получать нереальное удовольствие. Хотелось бы, посоветовать, тем, кто будет играть на геймпаде, обязательно берите «DualSence», не пожалеете, сразу добавляет один балл к погружению, каждый шаг, каждый выстрел, отдает вибрацией, а адаптивные триггеры, заставляют пальцы напрягаться и дрожать, трястись и уставать, будто ты сам жмёшь на спусковой крючок, облаченный в «силовой доспех». И самое главное, что даёт тебе игра, это невероятное чувство сплоченности, когда приходится выживать на поле боя, стоя спиной к спине, и рассчитывать лишь на рефлексы и верный «болтер» в руках.

• Сюжет: продолжает события первой части, с интригой, эмоциональными качелями и неожиданными поворотами. Диалоги в свою очередь, помогают раскрыть характеры персонажей, а следить за изменением их взаимоотношений, в течение всей истории, довольно интересно. При каждом возвращении на «Боевую баржу», братья по оружию, дают новые крупицы информации о мире, и происходящих в нём событиях. В целом мне понравилось, возможно, фанаты, увидят там больше контекста, и отсылок к любимой франшизе, но лично для меня, как для любителя, присутствует легкая недосказанность, и многие вопросы, так и остались без ответа. Но меня радует, то, что есть задел на будущее, и у тебя как у игрока, возникает желание, ещё больше погрузиться во вселенную «Warhammer 40,000».

• Совместная игра и другие режимы: в коопе игра начинает играть новыми красками, и дарит незабываемые впечатления. Также есть PvE «Режим операций», где, к примеру, можно создать собственного «космодесантника», с уникальной персонализацией, и пройти задания отрядов, участвовавших в событиях основной компании, но действующих параллельно отряду «Тита», или сражаться в режиме «Вечной войны» в PvP.

• Озвучка: во-первых, она есть, во-вторых, мне понравилась намного больше оригинала.

«Ересь»:

• Геймдизайн: игра далеко ушла во всех аспектах от предшественницы, кроме геймдизайна, на мой взгляд, в 2024 году, он смотрится немного устаревшим, у меня было ощущение, что я вернулся во времена, «Xbox 360» и «PlayStation 3», и поймите меня правильно, это неплохо, в какой-то мере, даже хорошо, учитывая засилье игр с открытым миром. Но возможно, мне хотелось бы чего-то более изобретательного, чего-то большего, чем однотипная структура миссий: достичь, продержаться, защитить.

• Геймплей: с одной стороны он прекрасен, но есть и оборотная сторона. На максимальном уровне сложности «Ангел Смерти», медлительность и топорность боёвки, начинает беспокоить, и нажатые вроде как в тайминг парирования, просто не срабатывают, время отклика оставляет желать лучшего. По итогу, в крупных замесах с сильными врагами, ты пропускаешь удары, которые стоят тебе жизни. И вы будете правы, если скажете, что-то вроде: «ты просто не умеешь играть» или «попробуй понизить сложность», но зачастую именно на высоком уровне сложности, боевая система раскрывается в полной мере, и тот факт, что она не работает так, как ты от неё ожидаешь, способствует возникновению вопроса: «а тестировалось ли это вообще?».

• Оптимизация и баги: игра на высоких настройках, с моей «RTX 3070», и в 2к разрешении, чувствовала себя неплохо, но в моменты «тяжелых» сцен, случались просадки кадровой частоты до 20-30 FPS, что превращало игру в слайдшоу, а про попытки сделать парирование, я вообще молчу. В одной из миссий, на лифте, произошел баг, когда я не мог взять ни аптечку, ни гранаты, и, учитывая ограниченное количество ресурсов, опять же, на уровне сложности «Ангел Смерти», дальнейшее прохождение игры, не представлялось возможным.

В целом игра очень крутая, лично у меня, возможно по незнанию лора, остались вопросы к сюжету и повествованию. Происходящее, показалось мне несколько скомканным и рваным, мечущимся от одной темы к другой, и не до конца их раскрывающим. Где-то не хватило объема информации, а очень бы хотелось. Но, так или иначе, эта одна из лучших игр этого года, красивая, эпичная, масштабная, с отличным саундтреком и разрывным геймплеем, игра, в которую хочется возвращаться, рвать и кромсать «ксеносов», «За Императора»!

А разработчикам, которые оказались нашими ребятами, и сделали достойную игру по вселенной «Warhammer 40,000», хочется пожелать не останавливаться на достигнутом, и никогда не сдаваться!

СЮЖЕТ/немного о геймплее

Всё развивается спустя 100 лет, после окончания сюжета оригинальной Space Marine. Осуждённый капитан Тит отбыл свой срок в карауле смерти и в ходе выполнения задания был сильно ранен, но прибывшие марины спасли его. Очнувшись, Тит говорит, что хотел бы вернуться в караул у смерти. Каппелан же настаивает, что его связь с хаосом оспорена и он должен снова надеть броню примариса. После идёт знакомство с новым отрядом, высадка на планету и эпичные битвы.

Сюжетная компания мне понравилась. Эпика в сравнении с оригиналом навалили мега много, как в локациях, так и в происходящем. Можно пройти всё играя в команде из трёх человек, чего не было в первой части. Локации в большинстве своём это почти прямые коридоры до конца уровня. Сражаться предстоит с тиранидами и хаосом. Битвы с боссами сделаны очень активными, но стрелковый урон по ним низкий, а в качестве основного оружия обязательно будет лишь болтер, что печалит. Доступные 4 уровня сложности. Общее количество оружия увеличили до достаточно обширного количества.


Графон, прям чувствуется во всём от того, как греется ваша система, при высоко-средних настройках с пресетом DLSS на скорость до графического гигантизма. 3080 держит в большинстве случаев стабильные 60 кадров с очень редкими просадками, но когда начинается режим волны врагов, просто готовьтесь к стабильному снижению на 20 кадров.

Ролики у игры выглядят эпично круто. Я бы сказал, что Saber могли и фильм спокойно слепить.

Кровищи тоже в игре достаточно, а добивания выглядят сочно и кроваво.


Вам на выбор всегда будут предложены 6 классов со своими наборами оружий и уникальными умениями. Для открытия новых скинов нужно фармить валюту за которые по открываются новые облики и осуществляется прокачка в ПВЕ.

Один режим в котором представлены 6 миссий. Выбирайте всё также из доступных классов и втроём выполняете указанную цель. Одинаковые классы выбирать запрещено. Четыре уровня сложности, где вам рекомендую заходить на определённом уровне персонажа. Если вы прошли компанию на уровне сложности Ангел Смерти, то можно сразу начинать со второй.

Карта каждый раз одинаковая, но генерируются случайные набеги врагов, переставляются сундуки с патронами и в некоторых местах стоят другие враги. В случайных местах можно найти серво череп или геносемя. Череп принесёт доп ресурсы, а семя подарит опыт, но если вас не убьют. После первого падения союзники могут вас поднять, после чего происходит воскрешение спустя 60 сек. Реиграбельность есть, но она прям минимальная. В коопе конечно весело, а при отсутствии союзников выдадут ботов, что любят втыкать в каждый файт.

Фармить здесь придётся много. Опыт идёт в каждого персонажа отдельно и оружие будет общим для некоторых классов.

У персонажа открываются новые умения облегчающее дальнейшие попытки прохождения и более высокий уровень сложности. Будут командные и личные навыки. Вроде 8 категорий, где в каждой представлен выбор из 3-х доступных умений, но все удастся открыть лишь к 25 уровню.

Для оружия всё прям куда более запарно. У вас есть опыт гира и опыт оружия. Выше уровень гира = более мощные пушки будут доступны. Но прежде чем открыть новый уровень нужно его открыть, а потом накопить указанное количество опыта. Есть различные модификации оружия. Скажем + урон или увеличенная обойма, если совсем по-простому. И вот прокачав такую модификацию вам дадут одно очко для улучшения оружия. Бонусы там местами забавно распределены. Если вам лень качать опыт или не нравится бонусы оружия, то просто потратьте спец ресурс получаемый за прохождение миссии.

Что мне не нравится в прокачке пве.




Всего 3 режима, которые на мою скудную память были ещё в оригинальной SpaceMarine. Играя в любой из доступных режимов вы получаете опыт и ресурсы. Уровни общие для открытия оружия, а также есть отдельные для каждого класса. Карты достаточно маленькие и бои идут почти постоянно. В среднем матч длится 10 минут. Из 6 доступных классов можно пикнуть только 2 одинаковых.







Отмечу особенности данных сражений и спорные моменты.












Покупал себе супер премиум отсос эдишн за 5200р. Зачем? А вот просто захотелось. Провёл в игре 22,5ч из которых 7-8ч было потрачено в коопе на прохождение сюжетной компании на сложности Ангел Смерти, 1,5ч наверное на пвп и остальное на пве. Если вас интересует только сюжетная кампания, то рекомендую поднять знакомый флаг и насладиться лишь ей, но в одиночном режиме. В коопе конечно веселее.

ПВЕ в общем мне понравился, но реиграбельность в общем слабая и постоянно перепроходить никто не будет. Мне кажется большинство людей сыграли по 1-2 раза на каждой карте и забили.

ПВП баланс местами кажется странным, карт мало и пинг на некоторых серверах доходит до 300. Судя по достижениям мало кто отыграл 10 раз в один из режимов.

Ещё игра доставит вам Epic Online Wrvice для кроссплея. Saber отлично прогрели твич дропами на скины в особенности за платную подписку и конечно за подписку на warhammer+ вам дадут болт(Р)! И конечно мне понравился ранний платный бета тест. Выдаю себе значок “Я не ЛОХ”!",2024/9/10,ru

Omnissiah Corp,1,73.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OmnissiahCorp/,"Žádné další woke games, tohle je hraní pro tvrdé chlapy. Hrozný nářež, od první mise swarmy nepřátel všude kam oko pohlédne. Graficky skvělé, na lepším PC až fantastické a bojový systém a ovládání je o zvyku. Veterání z předchozího dílu, ale i takových Gears of War dobře znají. Náboje věčně nejsou a když jo, dojdou rychlostí blesku. Tohle je prostě kruté a nemilosrdné melee !! Co mne opravdu nadchlo již u první mise je výpravnost, ten pohled do dálky na bitevní pole poseté stovkami Tyranid bestií, na zemi i na nebi, to bude nejen pro hardcore fans Warhammer 40k asi to největší wow. Kampaň má přibližně 12 hodin hrací doby, příběh solidně graduje a rozhodně jsem se skvěle bavil. Jedná se o lineární postup každou z misí, kdy hra občas přehodí hráči zbraně dle postupu a obecně ho moc za ruku nevodí. Opět, chce si to trošku zvyknout a akceptovat záměr vývojářů, aby jste si v pozdější části kampaně užili naprosto top cut scény, z toho doslova stříká testosteron. Bossové jsou zábavní se solidní obtížností, i na normal to může pro některé hráče být docela morda dokončit.

Další z nabídky herních modů je PvE mise a PvP, oba zábavné. PvE Solo Operations umí být až neskutečně těžké, ale odemykání různých class mariňáků a zbraní s perky je solidní zábava na další hodiny.

Optimalizace hry je velmi dobrá, žádné záseky, crashe ani dropy FPS jsem vůbec nezaznamenal. Pro rychlé načítání to chce ale solidní SSD, rozhodně by jsi ho měl mít. Takže nic, co by mě u pre-orderu nepříjemně překvapilo, naopak chválím stav hry ihned po vydání. Obočí mi nadzvedlo snad jen to, že podporu širokoúhlých monitorů přinese až jedna z pozdějších záplat? Proooč?

Někoho taky třeba zarazí, že hra po spuštění zahájí bez dotazů instalaci Epic online služeb - mě osobně to je naprosto ♥♥♥ - jen zmiňuji. Nejedná se o propojení Epic a Steam účtu, to se může a nemusí provést přímo v herním menu. Jde tedy vyloženě o cross-play funkci, tzn. aby vás hra dokázala připojit na vzdálené servery. Bohužel to tady x-recenzentů asi nepochopilo a psalo hejt, jako pardon - tohle je absurdní. Váš kompl není trezor a ty internety nejsou anonymní.

Das Spiel bringt all das mit, was ich an diesem düsteren und brutalen Universum liebe: großartige Grafik, flüssige Performance und eine packende Atmosphäre, die mich voll in die Schlachten des 41. Jahrtausends eintauchen lässt.

Grafik – Eine beeindruckende Reise ins Chaos

Die Grafik ist schlichtweg atemberaubend. Von den detaillierten Rüstungen der Space Marines bis zu den schier endlosen Horden der Tyraniden – jedes Modell ist ein visuelles Highlight. Die Umgebungen sind düster und episch zugleich, genau wie man es von Warhammer 40K erwartet. Besonders beeindruckend fand ich, wie die Explosionen und Kämpfe visuell eingefangen wurden. Jeder Treffer hat Wucht, jede Explosion lässt den Bildschirm erzittern, und die Schlachtfelder verwandeln sich schnell in Ruinen. Es ist, als würde man mitten in einer Schlacht stehen.

Performance – Flüssig, auch wenn es hektisch wird

Selbst bei den größten Schlachten bleibt die Performance stabil. Ich hatte keine Einbrüche in der Bildrate, auch wenn Dutzende von Tyraniden auf dem Bildschirm wüteten. Das Spiel läuft bemerkenswert flüssig und zeigt, wie gut optimiert es ist. Besonders beeindruckend ist, wie es selbst auf mittleren Systemen stabil läuft, ohne an visueller Qualität zu verlieren.

Spielgefühl – Intensiv und brachial

Was mir besonders gefallen hat, ist das Gefühl, tatsächlich ein Space Marine zu sein. Space Marine 2 schafft es, die Wucht und Stärke eines Ultramarines perfekt zu vermitteln. Jede Nahkampfatacke fühlt sich wuchtig an, und die Bolter-Schüsse haben einen befriedigenden Klang. Man hat das Gefühl, unaufhaltsam durch die Feinde zu pflügen – und genau so soll es sein! Die Steuerung ist dabei intuitiv und flüssig, sodass es Spaß macht, durch die gegnerischen Horden zu wüten.

Atmosphäre – Das 41. Jahrtausend zum Leben erweckt

Space Marine 2 fängt die düstere Atmosphäre des Warhammer 40K-Universums perfekt ein. Die Brutalität, die Hoffnungslosigkeit und die ständige Bedrohung durch die Tyraniden sind in jedem Moment spürbar. Der Soundtrack und die Geräuscheffekte tragen zur Immersion bei – von donnernden Explosionen bis zum furchteinflößenden Brüllen der Feinde. Man fühlt sich wirklich, als kämpfe man um das Überleben der Menschheit.

Fazit – Ein Muss für 40K-Fans

剧情方面依旧是简单的砍翻所有敌人的设计
在敌人种类方面：
目前敌人的种类肉眼可见的还是在8版至九版设计的，如果你想看到会动的诺恩那就可能得等更新了。
泰伦方面有刀虫、枪虫，武士、枪武士，脑虫、蛇虫、大脑虫，刽子手、利卡特、撕裂虫、石像鬼、孢子和暴君
千子方面有红字战士、巫师、教徒、叛变星界军、尖角兽、圣甲虫终结者。
但是在正常游玩中，玩家能面对的虫子单位会缺少暴君，几乎在整个流程中见到的都是刀虫、枪虫、武士、枪武士
石像鬼仅在少数关卡会遇到
而暴君并不在正常游戏里面，他放到多人PVE里了
这游戏的虫子射击很离谱，如果你玩过黑神话的话，里面耗子也就图一乐，这枪虫真的会给你打破防。
在关卡设计方面：
个人认为教学观设计得很屎，难度偏高且长······
如果你想联机和朋友打怪，建议是你先自己通一遍再联PVE任务，不然你是没法直接解锁PVE任务的。
关卡设计不算很巧妙，流畅度也有缺失（相比一代），整个地图的设计就一条线，然后走到尽头，开开关，继续走，再开开关，这些设计明显是能自动完成 ，不知道为什么得故意这样设计。

Pk,1,234.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075857716/,"Покупая самое дешёвое издание - вы получите всю игру со всеми будущими нововведениями, любые доплаты сверх - просто косметика по заявлению разработчика. World War Z предыдущая схожая игра от этих разработчиков и там за 5 лет только 2 платных ДЛЦ с контентом по адекватной цене.

Обзор от человека что был сильно далёк от ВХ 40к и знает только что Магнус не предавал и Император это Бог, но игра заинтересовала вселенной и я начал немного больше смотреть видео о лоре 40К.

Невероятно затягивающий геймплей, скорость прокачки приемлемая, хотите быстрее - идите на операции выше первого уровня. Рекомендую играть на максимально вывозимой вами сложности для получения того самого духа вечной войны, когда, выходя из большой волны противников, вы глубоко выдыхаете что смогли, преодолели, буквально крошево из врагов. Эти чувства можно сравнить с хорошо проработанным по механикам боссом из соулс игр.
Постоянные проверки вашей реакции будут.

Хотите ближний бой - имеется 3 вариации классов что сфокусированы на ближнем бою, но ничего не остановит вас если вы захотите сделать из снайпера ближний бой, это будет работать. Боёвка из блоков, уворотов, парирований с крайне красивыми добиваниями, особенно Ксеносов (местных жуков), не оставит равнодушным любителя соулс игр.

Хотите дальний бой - на выбор 3 класса что могут играть через стрельбу и 1 класс гибрид. Импакт от оружия - отдача и попадания во врагов, чувствуется, хоть и не весь огнестрел действительно хорош. Головы при хэдшотах разлетаются в фарш с отзвуком за каждое такое убийство.

На данный момент доступна кампания на 6-10 часов (в зависимости от сложности), 6 PVE операций и PVP с тремя видами задач.
Операции будут основным пластом геймплея. Каждое задание является прямым коридором с аренами от старта до финиша, но это даже плюс для тех кого задолбали пустые открытые миры. Здесь одна цель - иди дальше и рви и кромсай всё что встанет на твоём пути.
Местоположение и количество противников в одной и той же операции будут случайными, на сложностях выше 1й будет появляться случайный босс с шансом (на данный момент у жуков 2 босса, у второй фракции 1).
Расходники в виде гранат, патронов, аптечек, реликвий (селф ревайв) спавнятся тоже всегда случайно и количество уменьшается чем выше уровень сложности.
Геносемя - предмет что нужно донести до конца миссии ни разу не упав на колено несущему может появится на миссии с шансом и если донести +40% опыта.
Череп с ресурсом для прокачки оружия на следующую редкость появляется 1 раз за миссию с случайным расположением в фиксированных точках спавна.
Сложность 4 проходится только либо хорошо сыгранной группой не очень сильных игроков либо очень сильных игроков рандомов (почему не соло будет чуть ниже, хотя и реально).
PVP чувствуется довольно сбалансированным, но я отыграл только 5 матчей, так что мнение моё может быть ложным.

Очень хорошо отполированная игра, из багов что я встретил за 130 часов игры:
1) Невозможность стрелять/взаимодействовать с чем либо пока не нажмёшь смену оружия - встречается раз в 6-10 часов геймплея и возникает либо самостоятельном при воскрешении, либо при присоединении к кому-нибудь в игру
2) Оверхил восстанавливаемого хп что можно абьюзить вылечиваясь на фул, если имеется достаточно урона
3) Сброс кд перков оружия если сменить на первичное/вторичное
4) За 130 часов игры 1 раз встретил невозможность реса из-за смерти в текстуре
5) Очень редко может встретится левитирующий игрок

Главные минусы игры:
1) Очень НЕжелательно играть в одиночку, играйте хотя бы с рандомами, в худшем случае они сделают столько же сколько и бот. Боты крайне тупые и максимум на что они годны это кинуть гранату раз в 5 минут и не умирать чтобы ресать игроков и то бывает что они на месте встают и зависают. Сложность 3-4 соло, не имея полностью вкаченного оружия и класса, не подбирая экипировку и перки под миссию, пройти крайне сложно.
2) Оптимизация у игры хромает, 3080 на ультрах выдаёт 40-60 фпс, только DLSS на балансе или ниже спасает ситуацию. В самом начале даже игру запустить не мог дальше первой кат-сцены из-за того что игра была на HDD, а не SSD.
3) Нет поддержки ультра высоких разрешений, но завезут уже в ближайшие дни.
4) Мало контента в операциях, их всего 6, геймплей затягивает когда перестаёшь обращать внимание на одни и те же задачи миссий.
5) Странное решение с непробиваемыми текстурами. На первой миссии, если вам встретится летающий противник - вы заметите как стреляя в листья, болты не пройдут сквозь и вы потратите патроны впустую. Иногда будут ситуации с противниками что вызывают подкрепления стоя за текстурами перил и вы не сможете прострелить их и сбить вызов.
6) Постоянные загрузки, в игру, из игры. Вы нередко будете жать Alt F4 после ожидания 4+ минут загрузки кому-нибудь в лобби.",2024/9/17,ru

Oyunun hikayesi güzel ve giderek ilgi çekici oluyor.

Üstüne hikayeyi ve co-op görevleri birlikte oynayacak arkadaşınız varsa zevk katsayınız giderek artıyor. Boss savaşları yeterli sayıda ve bence gayet iyiler. Özellikle imurah adlı boss ile kapışmalarımız zevkli çünkü koduğumun hereticine parryi koyuyorum yamuluyor ve diz çöküp abi nolur yapma diye yalvarıyor. Çok tatmin edici.

Mathazzar,1,114.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972499254/,"Edit 10/28/2024 - Patch 4.0 rolled back some of the..worst changes. However, Chaos is still incredibly unfun to fight for the below reasons. They mention things like win percentages, but I wonder if that's Chaos and Tyranid missions lumped together. The buffs to bolters are..lackluster. They still remain the option for someone wanting to shoot themselves in the foot. I'll mark it recommended but hestitantly.

I won't lie. It was pretty bearable at release but.. I don't really know what the devs are doing in regards to balance and I don't think they know either. Everything I'm about to write is taken from someone who runs 90% difficulty 4 of 5 (Ruthless) and has their survivor helmet from the Lethal (5/5) missions. And this is all for PVE only.

They've done balance passes nerfing the damage on weapons when most of the weapons are already pretty bad.

Chaos majoris are the examplars of this poor design. They can teleport around in an instant. You will need to do about a dozen or two full melee combos to down them but, they can teleport away without warning.

The flamer chaos marines are the worst of the worst. They can teleport without warning in the middle of your combo, charge up a dodge only attack while you're still in an animation that you can't animation cancel out of, and reduce your armor and a good chunk of your HP near instantly. Even if they don't teleport, your dodge roll is shorter than the AOE ring you need to flee from but you won't have time to do the second dodge roll before you're hit. They have incredible range but that doesn't matter because, again, they can teleport to you.

And you may think the answer is a gun. But because the guns have been near nerfed into the ground - you will need to spend multiple magazines per marine.

And they did do a patch that made fighting chaos ... not so bad. And then immediately rolled that back partially and amped up the grind by making us worse at fighting into it.

#NAME?,1,466.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056606996/,"The game is Warhammer 40K through and through. Grim, Dark and gritty.

The story is good and introduces you to why Titus got turned into a Primaris well.
For the obvious culture war question: No, it is not ""woke"".

Combat is violent and satisfying. A similar experience to what I recently had with Batman Arkham Knight. It is challenging.
(Countering, dodging and learning patterns etc, but it is more simplified here).
When you play as Titus you FEEL like a Space Marine. The power of the melee attacks, ripping enemies limb from limb. The shaking footsteps where you can 'feel' the weight behind every step. The thunderous boom as so much armour, meat, bone and muscle hits the ground after jumping down a ledge.

Started the game on hardest difficulty, and it is very challenging. Still determining if it will be possible to finish playing solo with bots. Edit: Seems possible, but is very challenging. Would only suggest ""Angel of death"" difficulty for the most dedicated players.

Shooting is also satisfying, but can't be completely relied on, engaging in melee is nearly mandatory once swarms close in.

Visuals are very impressive and faithfully 40K.

Sounds are all great and when involved in fighting give you the feeling you are in a battle.
Music is dark and 100% fits 40K theme. The main theme when the game starts actually sent chills down my back. (Awe inspiring).

After a quick look, operations and Endless War mode will provide plenty of replay opportunity.
Edit: Operations is thoroughly enjoyable. Levelling up is fun and very satisfying to become more powerful with more perks, better weapons and the armour skins are beautiful. The artists REALLY put effort into them!

On technical and performance, the game is running beautifully. RTX 3060, I7-10700K, 32GB RAM, SSD, Windows 11. Ultra settings, native resolution @ 1080P with TAA gives 40-60 frames. Lowest frames I've experienced so far are 30 in graphically intensive portions. (Considering my hardware is not high end, the performance was surprising to me, it shows the game is well optimised in my opinion).

The game practically oozes all the effort and work the developers put into the game and definitely worth any 40K fan's attention.

Some are saying it has Epic. The game makes use of Epic online services. (Not an app, just core components that allow crossplay between Steam and Epic as well as the needed files for Easy Anti Cheat. No Epic account was required when I started the game and none created that I am aware of).

A couple of technical issues I can't figure out, sometimes voice lines are normal, then barely audible (with subtitles it isn't too much of a problem, but if playing without them you strain to hear them.)

The most glaring problem is that the so called anti-cheat is doing nothing to keep cheaters out from ruining the game for others. That alone is enough to spoil the entire experience in PVE and PVP.

Couldn't join a friend in campaign and still looking for a solution. (Will update review if I find one or find the cause). Edit: I was able to join friends today with a few retry attempts, but connecting isn't reliable and sometimes doesn't work. Edit #2: Connection much better. Regularly join with friends now and only disconnections now and then.

Edit: No crashes or glitches thus far with exception that sometimes a save seems to glitch out and you restart a checkpoint with lower ammo, different primary than the one you chose along the mission, meds and health than you had when you reached the checkpoint. (This happened to me on ""Severance"" mission when mobbing me. Unknown what exactly happens to cause the glitch.",2024/9/7,en
Lupercal,0,138.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994339649/,"My initial thoughts were that the game is an improvement in every conceivable way over the first one. It obviously looks better, has more combat mechanics, more equipment, additional gameplay modes. However the more I think about the game and try to engage with its mechanics the more frustrating it becomes. At this point in time I only recommend buying this on a sale of at least 30% if not more.

At this moment the game is significantly overpriced for what little it offers.
The campaign is short and looks extremely cool.
PvE has six linear maps in total, each is completed in about 25 minutes or less.
PvP I haven't played because despite there being an anti cheat there are plenty of cheaters anyway.
Congrats on wasting money on EAC.

The visuals are amazing. They are the best part of the game. I know the visuals and assets for the game were incredibly expensive (they look the part) and therefore there isn't that much content, but I wish the gameplay came first. But it truly looks absolutely amazing.

The gameplay, sadly, comes far behind the visuals. At the moment it can be downright painful at times.
I spent the majority of my time thus far in PvE (online coop). My problems with it are as follows:

Class lock in PvE feels awful. You cannot play with a full squad of tactical/devastator/assault. I'm not sure what came first, the idea for class lock and then they decided to make each character ""unique"" to compensate or whether it was the other way around. Anyway it doesn't feel good to be restricted in this way in a game that has so little content to do.
The voice lines attached to each character aren't even that hyperspecific to their class, they would be passable on other classes.

Enemies have mile long healthbars. Knowing the lore it makes sense to me (in particular for larger tyranid gribblies and Tsons) but with how its done in the game it makes combat feel like a chore at times. You just keep shooting your gun or wailing on an enemy with your melee weapon and its not having any noticeable effect other than vfx/sparks (which look nice).
The majoris+ enemies should have more flinch/stagger animations at least when getting shot.
I think its a miss to not add some sort of battle damage system where nids get their limbs hacked/blown off but keep coming at you. The Tsons could have ceramite, adamantium and engravings getting shorn off their armor from bolter fire.
In fact it would be cool if we could shoot off the guns off ranged enemies.

Just something that shows the player ""this guy is taking damage"", not just particle effects.
Small enemies have the beginning of this system, but it doesn't feel right.
Shooting a termagant for it to reset the 1st frame of the same ""owie I'm hit"" animation 6 times in a row makes me feel like my weapon is either a nerf gun or downright bugged.

Its extremely disappointing with how little damage melee weapons deal. The finishers and their animations are extremely cool, I wish there were more and changed with direction you approach an enemy, like in Doom 2016/eternal. I also wish I could decide whether my marine does a hand-to-hand finisher or uses his weapon to do it.
However taking several swings at a termagant/tzaangor with a thunder hammer only for it to keep fighting just feels bad.

The melee feels inconsistent in most situations. Parry and dodge sometimes just don't work, or possibly due to nearby enemies overlapping their attacks when close to you they force you to miss the parry and dodge window. Then you get stuck in the block animation (where at first you don't take damage) but you can't input any command, and then another comes in and keeps you stunlocked and makes you lose majority of your health.

The worst parts of melee is when you are in a crowd and get attacked by lots of small enemies - hormogants or tzaangors. Their attacks come out very fast and overlap and clip through each other, either forcing you to miss the parry window on the warrior/Tson and you block and then take damage, or you just whiff the parry and take damage anyway. Let me dodge/step out of a parry animation please.

Enemies have iframes on their dodges. It feels like you're being cheated out of what little damage you can put out.

The gunstrike is way too slow and I died multiple times while locked in the animation. Its generally a theme for how deaths happen in the game, you get stuck in some sort of animation/stagger you have no way of cancelling or getting out of and then you die.

The jump pack makes me very sad. In the campaign it worked just fine, but it is gutted in PvE.
Lets say you want to jump over a chasm or from one walkway to another, but they are separated by about 2 meters of empty space.
The game seems to draw a line from the base of your character and directly in front of a him. That line must be drawn over terrain you can walk on.
If that line encounters impassable terrain, such as a small safety barrier or a gap, in 90% of situations you can't jump over the barrier or that gap. So you see a distance you are certain you can jump over, you could walk to your target (so you know you should be able to jump there), but the game just doesn't let you. In addition, sometimes when the jump indicator (at the end of the line being drawn mentioned above) hits or collides with certain objects, the jump just won't activate. It just feels very janky and unsatisfying to use.

Now when you jump up, you can do a slam attack where the marine flies at high speed to the target on the ground.
You'd think the victim of that attack would get turned to paste after getting hit.
Nope. They just get staggered a bit.
In addition, during your slam attack you first hover midair ""charging"" the attack. This looks weird and should be removed, if anything the marine at the apex of the jump should slow down a bit, but not become stationary, and as gravity pulls him down he uses the jump pack to get more speed. Also during that little hover I get hit by melee attacks which shouldn't be able to reach me.

It feels incredibly unsatisfying, in particular with how long the cooldown is on the jump. With how little height you get from the jump I think it would be better if instead of a slam attack, it was a targeted charge where there is only 1 target (no AoE), but that target takes lots of damage and likely dies. That and also the marine hits the target with his weapon, not slams it into the ground. Also the jump pack should be the go to choice for tackling flying enemies (zoanthropes, levitating sorcerers), but there is no such option, You can either do a dash on the ground, jump from A to B, or jump and do a ground slam. There is a cutscene in the campaign that shows exactly how a jump pack should feel (it looks a bit OP there I'll admit, but it looks insanely fun) but having seen it and then trying the jump pack for yourself feels like you got cheated.

The ranged combat suffers from the same principal issue as melee - you just don't feel like you're doing any damage or that enemies are at all affected by taking multiple headshots in a row.
I think its most telling that the most fun to be had was using the the underslung grenade launcher or the sniper las fusil and two or three shotting majoris enemies. The melta is excellent at staggering hordes and clearing smaller enemies and leaving the large guys to take care of - honestly this should be a flamer (which for some reason is absent from PvE) and the melta should have a smaller blast but be the choice weapon to deal with heavy armour as in the lore.
When you have strong weapons which have direct impact like the three I mentioned, the ranged combat felt good. However, 90% of the guns do not have such an impact and therefore feel like trash.

Additionally, the amount of spread would be fine for a standard human, but how can an astartes have this much inaccuracy and spread? It makes no sense to me, in particular when all enemies are great at leading the player.

Its all so tiresome.",2024/9/16,en

l33tn3ss_17,1,16.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/l33tn3ss17/,"Space Marine 2 is a must-buy game that harkens back to the politics-free heyday of gaming. It is like taking a time machine back to the 2010s and going through all those beautifully made games during that era. It also shows how far AAA gaming has fallen. All publishers and development teams should take note and do better, focusing primarily on player experience over 'sending the message' and monetization. Saber Interactive should be very proud of what they have made.

If, like me, you are disappointed with the needless disrespect towards canon and established lore by Games Workshop lately, then you need not fear Space Marine 2. Space Marine 2 follows the story of Captain Titus in a way that respects what has been and does not cater to the tourists and nu-Warhammer fans destroying the hobby currently. Any true Warhammer fans can buy Space Marine 2 guilt-free.

The single-player campaign is long enough to provide a story that ties into the Era Indomitus and the previous story of the first Space Marine game. Playing it solo can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, but I found it to be well worth playing and had very few issues with it even though I finished it on early patches.

Playing Operations solo is also likewise a very meaningful experience that you cannot replicate elsewhere. I am ecstatic that Saber Interactive is continuing to develop more missions for this mode. The mission where you kill the Bio-Titan is my new favourite. I have had a few drops when I played it, but otherwise, I have not had any major issues.

Multiplayer is fun, but I still think the Bulwark class is overpowered, and some balancing is necessary. It is not a mode I have played a ton, but I can report no major issues.

A huge bonus is that the usual suspects hate Space Marine 2 and its success:



Another bonus is that the CEO of Saber Interactive is incredibly based:



As is some of their dev team:



I give Space Marine 2 a very solid 9/10, only citing some minor technical issues in Operations mode. Space Marine 2 is my game of the year this year on Steam, and I highly encourage anybody to buy it. Whether this is your first or tenth Warhammer game, this is a worthy buy and entry into the grimdark universe of 40k. Well done to Saber Interactive.",2024/11/28,en

Teshkomije,1,68.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Teshkomije/,"As a long-time fan of the Warhammer 40K universe and someone who enjoyed the original Space Marine, Space Marine 2 has completely blown me away!

From the moment I stepped into the boots of Captain Titus once again, I was hooked. The combat is absolutely brutal in all the best ways. Whether you're smashing through hordes of Tyranids with a chainsword or mowing them down with bolter fire, the action is fast, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. The melee and ranged combat balance feels perfect, and pulling off those savage executions never gets old.

The visuals are a massive leap forward compared to the first game. The environments are gritty and detailed, really capturing the grimdark essence of the 40K universe. Whether you’re fighting in ruined cityscapes or alien-infested hives, it all looks stunning and immersive.

One of the biggest highlights for me is the coop multiplayer. Playing with friends and unleashing the wrath of the Emperor as a team is an absolute blast. The teamwork and coordination required to survive against the swarms of enemies really elevates the experience, making it feel like you’re part of a true Space Marine squad.

Gameplay 9/10

Frantik,1,12.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkFrantik/,"Przyjemna, sentymentalna wręcz podróż do ery PS360, kiedy to większość gier akcji ukierunkowanych na pojedynczego gracza była wolna od zbędnych udziwnień i tony rozpraszaczy. W takim właśnie duchu, w połączeniu ze współczesną oprawą, powstał Space Marine 2.

Już od pierwszych chwil w kampanii czuć, że gra wie, czym chce być i dokładnie to oferuje. Walka jest mięsista i miodna, a przy tym prosta lecz nie prostacka i sumarycznie jest satysfakcjonująca. Naszej uwagi nie rozprasza nawet jakikolwiek rozwój postaci, a i znajdźki są szczątkowe (audiologi, które zresztą łatwo przeoczyć).

Pozytywnych wrażeń dopełnia świetnie oddany, ciężki klimat Warhammera 40k i nieraz odczuwalnie monumentalna skala wydarzeń, której czuciu wydatnie pomagają też chmary przeciwników, składające się nieraz z setek osobników, które potrafią tworzyć „żywe wieże” na podobieństwo tych z World War Z.

Gameplayowo fani Gearsów poczują się tu jak w domu, bo za wyjątkiem chowania się za osłonami, dostaną wszystko, za co polubili serię od Microsoftu. Protagonista oraz inni kosmiczni marines to odpowiednie gigachady, choć może bardziej od testosteronu czuć tu ich fanatyzm.
Na minus SM2 z kolei wypada mniejsza różnorodność rozgrywki. Biegamy, strzelamy, siekamy bądź tłuczemy lub robimy uniki – tylko tyle, nie licząc dwóch dość krótkich momentów w których dostajemy jetpack umożliwiający chwilowe wzbijanie się w powietrze. Szkoda, aż prosiłoby się choćby o jakieś sekwencje celowniczkowe na pokładzie maszyn bojowych, których w trakcie opowieści widzimy cały wachlarz.

Strzelając i rąbiąc ku chwale Imperatora od razu czuć, że jesteśmy potężni. Mniejsi wrogowie eksplodują niczym worki z posoką, ci nieco więksi szybko uznają naszą wyższość dając się rozciąć na kawałki – mamy tu zresztą system egzekucji podobny do tego z nowożytnych Doomów - odpowiednio zmiękczony adwersarz łapie stuna i przez chwilę jest podatny na efektowny finisher, który odnawia nam coś na kształt pancerza czy może bardziej pola siłowego. Co ciekawe, to samo nie tyczy się paska zdrowia – tu jesteśmy uzależnieni od znajdowania apteczek, których jest dość niewiele.
8-10h, jakie należy poświęcić na ukończenie singla, przedłużyć można jeszcze misjami co-opowymi, na jakieś 30-45 minut każda. Są one mocno powiązane z wydarzeniami fabularnymi i, choć obecne są tam rozmaite unlocki, nie sprawiają wrażenia GAAS-owej wydmuszki. Jest jeszcze tryb PvP, ale o nim nie mam za dużo do powiedzenia. Szkoda jedynie, że na premierę zabrakło trybu hordy. Ma być dodany kiedyś tam

Ode mnie solidne 8/10 i polecajka, dla wszystkich, którym tęskno do efektownej akcji i mięsistego strzelania. Nawet bez znajomości uniwersum WH 40k można się tu bawić bez problemu (sam wiem tylko tyle, że są space marines, którzy mają boga-imperatora i walczą z herezją oraz chyba wszelkimi pozostałymi rasami uniwersum, . orkami czy tyranidami). Acz zaznaczyć trzeba, że Space Marine 2, podobnie zresztą jak część pierwsza, niczego ze świata przedstawionego nam nie tłumaczy, pozostawiając wszystko ewentualnie naszej ciekawości i… sam czuję się nawet zachęcony do zgłębienia lore.",2024/9/19,pl

MrMarionette14,0,29.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMarionette14/,"战斗设计有大问题。从最简单的数值到最底层战斗交互没一个做好的。制作组想结合近战远程和其他战斗手段，但是结果就是全部拉胯。
游戏里绝大多数战斗都是给一个大空地然后刷出大量远近复合的敌人，但是玩家角色的性能又不足以顶着远程火力清掉近战敌人或是反过来。相比高压的虫巢或者混沌大军，玩家孱弱的解场能力实在是不值一提，而空旷的场地设计和对远程攻击的无能为力甚至让玩家连拉扯都做不到，打的慢就是死。
弹反的手感非常奇怪，根据提示按键却不一定能完美弹反，整体判定突出一个神秘，幽默枪决更是硬控自己一秒。同时战斗中经常出现防御或闪避无法中断当前攻击动作的情况，也不知道是bug还是什么。而且就算这样，也经常出现精英敌人配合攻击，弹反之后的硬直里受到其他精英怪的攻击。
另外硬直机制也非常恶心，受击产生硬直会导致在面对多个敌人或是特定连招时会被压起身。
关卡中的补给少的可怜，我不知道行动模式高难度下从头到尾能不能每个人捡到4个医疗包：这差不多是完全回复一个角色血量所需的。
敌人的攻击方式也非常逆天，绝大多数远程精英都能硬顶着攻击换血，其中特别是脑虫最离谱。作为一个集buff，大范围远程攻击，飞行一体的敌人，居然有厚的离谱的血量，纯逆天。优先处理吧，血太多rush不掉，最后处理吧，它会buff其他敌人，并且会用高频率的攻击逼迫玩家闪避。
boss除了判定神秘之外其实问题相对来说比较小，除了主线里的强化脑虫boss有个瞬发aoe过于逆天之外别的大多数都还捏着鼻子能打。
总结就是和1代相比玩家的续航和控制手段弱了非常多，但是敌人不管是数量还是强度都提升了非常多。面对的敌人超过了玩家的性能战斗体验非常憋屈。
虽然我觉得暗潮也是个垃圾游戏，但是我认为saber应该去玩500小时暗潮再重新设计这游戏。
看看暗潮是怎么做的：
在复杂的环境中玩家有掩体和转角可以依靠并让敌人汇聚在同一处。近战敌人会遮挡远程敌人的枪线。玩家有强力的技能解场，有滑铲回避远程攻击。
关卡中有固定的医疗站点，固定数量的医疗箱和补给箱，以及随机散布的医疗针和弹药。不说管够，至少没这么抠门。
敌人设计可能是暗潮做的最好的地方，虽然曾经出现过因为数值导致逆天火雷哥或者机枪手，但总体性能大多在合理区间。
暗潮的boss相对不算太出彩，但是和星际战士2相比依然不逊色，至少没什么要靠无敌帧躲的逆天全屏aoe这种奇葩设计。
考虑到暗潮也不是首发就做成那个样子，我的评价是未来可期。目前不推荐任何人（除非你真的特别特别喜欢战锤40k这个ip并且对垃圾系统有着良好耐受性）在制作组进行大幅度修改前购买。",2024/9/8,zh-cn

Mammothmk2,0,19.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mammothmk2/,"战役已通，合作在打，这游戏优点乏善可陈，但是有几个比较严重的问题，我们细说：
优点：
1.锤佬翘首期盼的具现化产物，如果你是锤佬，里面大多数要素都能知晓，目前也没有什么游戏能做到这么还原了。
2.不愧是僵尸世界大战的制作组，做敌人集群表现这方面真的有一套。
3.战斗表现，终结技的表现很不错，打击感反馈很爽。
缺点：
1.游戏鼓励近战，毕竟近战回盾，终结技无敌，但是反馈奖励实在太差，回盾就回那么一点，前期难度低的任务还好，后期远程敌人多起来，但凡你敢近战马上就把你打趴下，游戏也缺乏有效的AOE手段，除了飞天大锤，手榴弹和开技能，一旦被包围基本就是寄。什么，你说弹反和招架？满屏幕的蓝红圈，你招架哪个？且不说招架还有CD，还需要对准敌人，还要当心远距离黑枪的敌人，好在游戏体力是无限的，翻滚没有限制，但是这非常影响游戏的战斗体验，打着打着就变成翻滚人很是常见。
2.武器问题，说实话这游戏的武器简直少到令人发指，别误会，我说的是能用的武器，琳琅满目的爆弹枪，但是实际上就是弹匣，射速这类数值的平衡，所以基本上就是一堆射速，弹匣，射程参差不齐的爆弹枪，本质上都是滋水枪，威力低且滑稽。且不说你是一个阿斯塔特，后坐力和瞄准竟然这么离谱，稍微远一点那个散布就跟霰弹枪一样。好用的武器也就是热熔，等离子，狙这种杀伤大的武器，但是弹药少的让我怀疑自己到底是阿斯塔特还是星界军，游戏的补给也是一绝，一路上医疗包基本看不见，弹药补给补的少，还分散的广，角色治疗手段又匮乏，作为主力AOE武器的破片手榴弹只能带3个简直大开眼界，隔壁的披风蟑螂都能带4个，更别说披风蟑螂的军火库比你阿斯塔特丰富的多。
3.关卡设计和任务，如果你玩过僵尸世界大战，你会发现这本质上就是僵尸世界大战的任务模版，坚守，救援，杀敌突破，安置爆炸物，任务别说丰富了，用无聊来形容都未尝不可，本质上就是僵尸世界大战的那套刷刷刷，技能树，武器解锁等等，但是，其一，游戏前期角色实在太弱性能太差，挫败感实在太严重了，技能树的成长奖励也糟糕，基本上只有大后期才能体会神皇附体的爽感，其二，目前游戏的行动模式能刷的关卡就6个，敌人的种类也少，来回来去就那么几样，关卡重复度严重，导致内容乏善可陈，鼓噪无味。40K的世界观很大，只希望日后制作组可以及时的推出新内容，目前的这点内容可是完全不值200+的。
4.游戏抛开内容不谈，首先是作为一款24年的游戏，不支持HDR，不支持宽屏，这简直难以置信，具体原因到底是制作组的功底还是压根不想做我也不清楚，但实在不应该。至于网络则是这种PVE PVP游戏的老生常谈了，断连卡顿，队友鬼畜操作见怪不怪，这里不做过多评价。至于小蓝熊反作弊？这玩意除了恶心玩家自己，在反作弊这方面形同虚设，开一局PVP结果一进去满地的无敌盾佬，飞天神仙，基本没有打开第二次的欲望了。
总而言之，除非你是个忠诚异常的锤佬，否则我建议者200+还是别花了，中秋节临近，个人建议还是买个月饼礼盒孝敬长辈慰问朋友更好一点。",2024/9/8,zh-cn

Skallebank,1,322.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048001424/,"To preface, my review was negative, due to patch 4.0 which introduced a bunch of changes a week ago at the time I am writing this.

Today we had another patch that reversed said changes, and after playing for a few hours, I can honestly say that Space Marine 2 is back in a good position again. This is of course subjective, but I am clearly not alone having this viewpoint.

In its current state SM2 is gory, engaging, testosteronie- filled fun. I usually stick to various RPG, and haven't really enjoyed a shooter (if you can even call it that) since Battlefield 1942.

I can't stop playing this though.

You have a campaign, which takes about 7 hour'ish to complete. While that might sound short, it is highly entertaining. The quality is top notch. At least I was having a blast blasting, hacking and swordchainsaw'ing my way through it.

Than you have the online part. As someone who is generally burned out of online games, this still has hooked me. You have PvE coop missions, called operations, where you and 2 fellow Space Marines clear out 1 of 7 maps. You can chose between 5 difficulties. The lowest one being very easy, the hardest one .. well.. hard.

I could probably write an essay about this game, but bottomline:
This is my years Baldurs Gate 3. Totally different genres, but both are game of the year content for me.

Also kudos to Sabre for listening to the community feedback. They reverted a highly unpopular patch in 1 week. They are also introducing public test servers. So this is apparently a company that listens.",2024/10/20,en

The Doc,1,27,https://steamcommunity.com/id/drsnipe0987/,"~~The game is very fun but they broke the game on linux after it had been working since launch, therefore I cannot give a positive review. This will change if it ever works again. To be clear, I dont fault a game for not working on linux I will simply not buy it, but breaking it after its working is not acceptable.~~

Dirk Dickbutt,1,51.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DirkDickbutt/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II, is an alien murder machine simulator developed by Saber Interactive and published by those guys that made their fortune making cycling simulators.

On the planet Kedaku, a Deathwatch Killteam is sent in to deploy a virus bomb to, at the very least, slow down the Tyranid hordes ravaging the planet. Demetrian Titus, former Ultramarine and current Ordos Xenos clean up crew member, is heavily injured after a battle with a Carnifex. He is saved, however, by his former Chapter, and Titus is reinstated as Lieutenant of the Ultramarine’s 2nd Company.
Also, his Killteam all died. They seemed nice.

Now, having undergone the Rubicon procedure, Titus is now one of those Space Marines that are taller than normal Space Marines, but their armor isn’t as cool so it always kind of feels wrong. He, along with squad members Chairon and Gadriel (not to be confused with that elf lady from The Lord of the Rings: Galadriel), Titus does battle with the Tyranid swarms as he and his men discover now and terrible secrets in a star system at war.

Some people waited thirteen years for this game, I was one of them. Space Marine II is practically a continuation of the first game with some new and cool features added on. No longer being restrained on the 360 and PS3, Space Marine II does a great job actually capturing the scale and numbers of a Tyranid invasion of a planet.

Space Marine II, like the first one, is a third person shooter revolving around shooting aliens in the face and then tearing them apart with whatever beating stick you have on hand. There are a variety of weapons to choose from such as, the Bolt rifle, the other Bolt Rifle, the longer bolt rifle, the bolt rifle but with a better scope, the one that shoots plasma, the melta gun that feels like you’re pushing your hand through a ball of wet socks when you use it. And also a bunch of melee weapons like: The knife the side of my entire body, a chainsword so I can stab you while I’m stabbing you, the power sword which is like a regular sword but also cuts thing gooder, and the big hammer you use because your message wasn’t clear enough when the chainsword was being used.

Its a neat mix of Gears of War shooting and hack and slash action. Dumping an entire magazine of bolt rounds into a swarm of Tyranids and then laying into them with whatever melee weapon you have on hand is the bread and butter of the game play, and its a pretty good bread and butter. Its like the first game where you turn grots and Orks into Swiss cheese, but now theres a ♥♥♥♥ ton more Tyranids than there were Orks in the first game, and slicing through them in swathes is basically dopamine injected straight into my brain.

There are also larger, angrier, hornier Tyranids that accompany the swarms. Warriors are the most common, but you do occasionally have to deal with other variants like the Lictor, a stealthy bastard, and the Carniex, a big bastard.
Zoanthropes are there too, but who cares.

Mission variety is mostly just trying to stem the tide of alien bugs, either by blowing them up good or deploying something that upsets them. But there’s some intrigue in the story, enough to keep you hooked with the plot, like a big reveal that I can’t mention.

Chaos is there, Tzeentch flavored this time. That’s not a spoiler, they’re in the promotional material. That’s not the big reveal, though.

Outside of the story mode, you also have two multiplayer modes to keep you coming back. Operations is a 3 player Co-Op mode where you and two of your Space Marine pals do stuff that helps Titus and the 2nd Company, as well as the Cadian 8th and any other Imperial butt hole in the system, deal with the invaders and send them packing. Its an interesting mode, almost reminds me of Left 4 Dead sometimes, its really fun to play, just make sure you have 2 other pals to play with or else an NPC follows you around and that’s lame.

The OTHER other mode is PVP, the Eternal War is an 8 vs 8 man murder mode where the Primaris Astartes do battle with the Heretic Astartes, the Chaos Space Marines, the LEGIONES TRAITORIS.
You have several classes to pick from, the same ones you pick in Operations, and then go to town on one another, either trying to kill 50 of them before they kill 50 of you or holding objectives until the timer runs out or the meter fills up.

Its a goofy, fun, chaotic time, but its also frustrating at points. It feels like kind of an after thought in a way. And the name of the game seems to be grouping up and melting the other guys via focused fire before they can melt you. You can do some clever things every now and then with your class abilities, but it mostly comes down to who sees who first and who pulls the trigger faster.

I like the game a lot, solid 8/10 for me, there’s just some things that irk me the wrong way. A lot of the weapons feel undertuned. I feel like when a weapon is basically “The one you start with, but bigger.” it should feel like it. I think a Tyranid Warrior, the ranged ones, once took 20 some rounds of bolter to the face before even being stunned.
The Boltguns in general also feel weak, I mean that in a game feel kind of way, not in a balance way, it does have problems balance wise, but. The way it sounds just sounds weak to me.

The Bolter in the first game was mean, it sounded like someone was punching the side of a car door really hard. The Bolt Rifle however may as well be making a “pew pew” sound.

Also, please put more attention into the PVP. I don’t know exactly how to fix it, maybe new maps and random spawns or fine tune the weapon a bit better? It feels like an afterthought since it was in the first game, which it might have been.

Yeah I like it a lot.

Space Marine II does a good job in capturing that fantasy of being a giant, 8ft tall meat mountain murder machine in a messed up super future. Your steps are big and stompy, and everything you hit with any kind of weapon just turns into a fountain of blood. Tyranids coming at you in the hundreds and literally climbing over one another like a tidal wave to get up a wall is amazing to see.

Warhammer 40,000 is such a weird franchise to me, mostly just because of where it stands as a series. Its a tabletop War game with a lot of extended universe material like books, comics, and y’know, video games.

Having been a Necron Player for the last 20 years or so, because I like winning and Terminator kicks ass, I got to see the war game I love fluctuate and change, introducing new people, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.

40K is the only War Game I know where a good chunk of the fanbase actively refuses to play it. Even a lot of the other material is -mostly- ignored in favor of just reading summaries on wikis around the internet. Warpath and Mutant Chronicles probably don’t have this problem, and you probably don’t even know what those are.
And if you do, hey! We should play sometime.

Its a series that people want to change, mostly for the worse. Its also a series that people are way too invested in, and not even from a financial point of view. This endless war on the internet about what 40k should and shouldn’t be is, hilariously enough, sort of indicative of the franchise as a whole. An endless battle between people that don’t actually want a common ground, they just want to be in charge.

Its still very near and dear to my heart, but there’s probably going to come a time in the future where I might just have to move on. Mostly because of corporate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but if my friends are all gone, I may as well go too.

Space Marine II: The Return of Titus Meat Man gets 8 Bolt rounds out of 10.

下面是我个人的一些意见，虽然感觉这个游戏开发出来还是像一个半成品 但是这个平台的潜力还是有。40k世界那么大体量 这种坦克装甲车载具 终结者 无畏 各种型号的骑士和泰坦 都是游戏内容等着你们开发 各个战团的皮肤不卖到手抽筋吗。我看评论里也有建议搞一个多人的战场模式 把这些内容投进去 在线玩家肯定爆满。战场模式游戏平衡做好做好还会有一批长期的玩家 。战锤世界那么多种族够开发到天荒地老海枯石烂的。我相信除了忠诚玩家和混沌四神的信徒以外还有一大批玩家想要和搞毛二哥一起体验大waaaag的神奇 战斗就是爽！ 想像利卡特一样杀人于无形 和武士虫一样砍sm如同砍瓜切菜 大吞噬者饿了就是吃。想遵循上上善道的旨意征服宇宙 又或者刚起床就发现家被机械教给挖穿了的太空死灵等等，要知道锤友可不只有忠诚派 各个种族势力的玩家都有。还可以开发一个单挑模式或者战旗模式打打排位等等—
另外 不是锤粉的路人玩家还是建议在蹲蹲看 等打折了在入手。
I am a die hard fan who immediately rushed to luxury. After watching the trailer, I was already looking forward to it, and after watching the trial, I was even more excited! Finally, when I was able to play, I encountered numerous difficulties from downloading, installing, to the silly Epic and subspace server, and managed to finish the plot in the first place. I feel a bit disappointed, but I can only say that the advantages and disadvantages of the game you made are basically the same as those of World War of Zombies, with too little content. But there is one difference, the 40k world view volume of Warhammer makes me feel like I spent 399 to buy a DLC. It's just a multiplayer task that can be played for a while, but with only six maps, it won't last long. It can only be said that the future is promising.
Here are some of my personal opinions. Although I feel that the development of this game is still like a semi-finished product, there is still potential for this platform. The tank, armored vehicle, terminator, and various models of knights and titans in the 40k world are game content waiting for you to develop skins for various battle groups. Isn't it selling them for sale. I also saw suggestions in the comments to create a multiplayer battlefield mode and throw these contents into the online game, which will definitely be packed with players. If the balance of the battlefield mode game is done well, there will still be a group of long-term players. There are so many tribes in the Warhammer World that can be developed to the point of devastation. I believe that in addition to loyal players and followers of the Chaos Four Gods, there is also a large number of players who want to experience the magical battles of the Great Waaaag with Brother Mao! Imagine killing invisibly like Licat and chopping SM like a warrior bug, like chopping melons and vegetables. The devourer will eat when hungry. If you want to follow the will of the best way to conquer the universe, or just wake up and find that your home has been mechanically taught to the space undead that has been dug through, you should know that Hammer Friends are not only loyal players of various races and forces. You can also develop a one-on-one mode or battle flag mode to rank and so on",2024/9/7,en

Cons
-Comes out with DLC already being advertised
-Poor servers that lag (even during single player)
-Single player story is around 8h on hardest difficulty
-PvP mode is bare bones with painfully slow progression that locks any real customisation with high levels (not to mention you can only customise your look half the time as you're forced to wear heretic armour during half the matches which you can't customise)
-Loading screens on loading screens on loading screens (You might think I'm exaggerating to emphasise but you will have to do a loading screen to go into another loading screen for all multiplayer modes)

Pros
-Looks cool, visuals are really nice
-Its warhammer 40k

Do not buy on full price wait for a sale.

Kyreek,0,130.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012430085/,"J'adore l'univers de Warhammer 40K, j'avais adoré le premier opus et les premières previews de ce Space Marine 2 étaient dithyrambiques alors j'ai foncé : précommande, ultra édition collector etc...

Et au final, après 8 h de jeu : un gros ""mouais""...

Oui, le lore est fidèle, oui, c'est ultra bourrin, oui, c'est joli mais... c'est tout.

À côté de ça, le jeu est pas super bien optimisé sur PC, c'est lourd et confus à manier, très répétitif, le PVP est bien faible côté contenu et finitions, les menus sont pénibles et le tout manque cruellement de QoL... Et puis, ce choix d'avoir mis les Tyrannides en ennemi principal, quelle erreur : on est finalement plus dans un BTA au corps-à-corps qu'un vrai jeu de shoot (comparé à Space Marine 1 où l'on affrontait des orks).

Du coup, oubliez toute notion de précision ou de headshots : les engagements sont toujours les mêmes avec des hordes de bestioles grouillantes qui vous foncent dessus, on balance deux, trois bastos à distance pour dégarnir les premiers rangs mais comme les ennemis sont de toute façon trop nombreux et rapides, que les tyrannides ""supérieurs"" sont trop résistants (et que l'on est vite à court de munitions en plus du rechargement qui prend une plombe), ça finit invariablement par défourailler à l'épée tronçonneuse avec quelques parades/esquives pas hyper intuitives.

Alors, c'est très fidèle au lore, hein. Mais c'est plat et redondant.

Et pourtant, j'ai envie d'aimer ce jeu, j'adore l'univers et tout mais au final c'est un peu la douche froide. Je lis les avis ici et là qui parlent du jeu de l'année, d'un shooter épique etc... et je me demande si on joue bien au même jeu : Space Marine 2 n'est pas une bouse mais clairement ça ne vaut pas tous les superlatifs qu'on entend sur lui et ça ne vaut pas 60 € non plus (et encore moins le prix en collector mais bon voilà, je me suis fait avoir, c'est la vie).



La campagne :
+ Agréable avec quelques moments de bravoure bien sentis
+ Un poil courte mais ça reste convenable

- Zéro envie de la refaire une fois terminée

Le mode opérations :
+ Concept sympa qui reprend des passages de la campagne mais sous un angle différent
+ Système d'upgrade et d'arbre de talent sympa
+ Les différentes classes bien fichues et leur gameplay qui change un peu

- Un poil répétitif quand on monte plusieurs persos Lv 25
- Parer comme un dieu pendant 25 min, avoir 3 secondes d'inattention et se faire ouvrir en deux en niveau Ruthless, quel plaisir
- Les erreurs de connexion serveur trop fréquentes, c'est vraiment pas sérieux

Le PVP:
+ Simple et efficace, à l'ancienne
+ Accessible à tous (hitboxes énormes, pas de saut hors classe Assaut, Pas de glissade/couvert, 3 maps à retenir...)
+ Légère composante MOBA/Hero shooter sympa
+ Toutes les classes apportent un truc

- Matchmaking débile qui met systématiquement les plus gros Lv ensemble VS les Lv 3
- On peut passer 2 jours à ne pouvoir jouer que les Space Marine du chaos qui sont visuellement HORRIBLES/low poly/pas customizables (genre relancer le matchmaking entre chaque game et quand même finir côté Chaos, j'ai jamais vu un truc pareil...)
- Les gens qui se font farmer alors que le PVP est simplissime, les Tactical qui ne scannent jamais les ennemis, les coéquipiers qui regardent la zone mais qui ne vont pas dessus, ça rend fou (même si c'est pas la faute du jeu)
- Les respawns : un coup, c'est 3 secondes, un coup, c'est 8 secondes, au pif...

Michelle,1,23,https://steamcommunity.com/id/coastalmichelle/,"Product received for free

I've already gotten to play a quite a bit as I received early review access for my podcast, so I can confidently say this game is worth the time of any Warhammer fan. Saber did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of 40k - the setting, story, sound design, and overall atmosphere are all very well done with an emphasis on attention to detail. Plus they simply nailed both the look and the intensity of ""the swarm"" (much better than Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Helldivers, or even Doom).

Likewise, the combat never gets boring, as you chain endless combos of guns and melee into satisfying executions. The campaign is solid and can be played solo or co-op. The operations mode (which plays a bit more like Vermintide or Darktide missions) has endless ways to customize your character - both with gameplay perks and weapon upgrades, but also a nice cosmetic progression system. There are also class trials to hone your skills and try out the various flavor of marine that best suits your tastes.

I'm looking forward to checking out Eternal War (the PvP mode) now that the game has launched to the general public. All in all it's just a fun game you should get together with the boys and play (or just ride a bunch of cool elevators together, there are a lot in this game).

Note: The 21:9 support wasn't in when I tried it yet, so hoping that comes in the Day 1 patch, as well as a fov slider.

✞ImKingJawn✞,0,62.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ImKingJawn/,"I cannot fathom in any way shape or form that Focus would decide that the game is entirely too easy. It comes as a very odd notion when you are constantly fighting an uphill battle for Armory Data, to become stronger, to make things easier. The entire premise of the games progression for operations was to complete operations, become stronger, and steamroll. What is the purpose of the entire progression system if the devs want to pull the rug out from beneath you? There genuinely isn't a good reason to have the entire progression system there in order to become stronger, just for the developers to decide that it's ""too easy"" and nerf everything. Genuinely the only people this system hurts is newer, non maxed out players. Because everyone with the maxed out weapons, perk trees, and levels already have the experience required to interchange their loadouts to make the game easier. It appalls me that a powerfantasy PVE game didn't see how these changes ruined Helldivers to a nigh irreparable state. Nerfing the Melta bomb, by SEVENTY PERCENT against the one boss people like saving it for? Ridiculous. Sure, some people on Youtube made it one-shot the Hive Tyrant. That doesn't mean that everyone plays like that. The fun thing about Space Marine 2 is build variety, and the more you nerf certain things the more that is taken away. To return to my former statement about Helldivers, that exact thing is what killed the game for me. I can't enjoy the game where I feel pressured to play the exact same way as everyone else because that is manageable and the way I like playing isn't.

But as a solo player going through the campaign on the recommended (albeit second hardest) difficulty, this game feels absolutely terrible to play. You have the two worst AI squad mates I have ever had the displeasure to call battle brothers, with the most useless and unforgiving ""armor"" system imaginable. Is it playable? Absolutely. Is it gratifying in difficulty to carry the bots through every mission while they exist only to throw some mostly ineffective bullets around and revive you (which will occur often)? No.

I do not even feel good getting better at the game sometimes, because it feels like I am competing against the actual combat system more than the enemies. So much of this game is made to be a flowing combat experience of dodging, slashing, and parrying, but often it just isn't. You get stuck in animations. You get notifiers of enemy attacks only like 1/3rd of the time. You get rewarded for parrying and playing it slow, but that just isn't effective when you're also getting swarmed by mooks that CHEW through you if you aren't constantly swinging, which paired with the aforementioned stuck in animations makes you take SO much unnecessary damage. Damage you barely heal from without wasting your ultimate with a lengthy cooldown, or frivolously utilizing the very scant med packs.

Carbonara?,1,41.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014942266/,"Finalmente un gioco che al lancio è stabile, con contenuti e senza particolari bug che ne rovinano l'esperienza. Ho finito da poco la campagna, perfettamente in stile Warhammer, senza particolarissimi colpi di scena e molto lineare ma godibile da subito. Gameplay semplice ma rifinito e che da soddisfazioni. La modalità PvP è uguale, semplice ma che riesce a coinvolgere, non è troppo impegnativa ma se avete una squadra, potete togliervi soddisfazioni a livello tattico. Graficamente molto bello e devo dire, ottimizzato anche bene. GPU e CPU non vanno in ebollizione, tutto gira bene. Ripeto, erano anni che non si vedeva un gioco al day one senza problemi, un prodotto FINITO. Non la solita uscita che si rivela un mezzo casino tra server e ottimizzazione per poi scoprire che mancano pezzi, bisogna aspettare DLC e quanto altro. Io lo consiglio vivamente.

NOTA DOLENTE:

La campagna non ha matchmaking purtroppo quindi o avete un amico/a (che vi consiglio assolutamente, è molto più divertente) oppure vi dovrete affidare ai bot che purtroppo, sono tutto fuorché intelligenti e in alcuni momenti, c'è proprio da bestemmiare perché non riescono a dare priorità a nemici pericolosi e purtroppo vi capiterà di morire malissimo anche un po' per colpa loro.

MINI TIP PER LA CAMPAGNA E PER LE OPERAZIONE (PVE):

In giro per la mappa, troverete delle casse VERDI con l'icona di una spada o qualcosa del genere, bene: DISTRUGGETELE, perché all'interno troverete colpi, stimolanti e a volte anche upgrade temporanei all'armatura. Sembra una cavolata ma quando l'ho casualmente scoperto, è stata una bella salvata a livelli alti con i bot; sopratutto per gli stimolanti.

Dewrill,0,65.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DocDewrill/,"for me, while i do enjoy the game, its gonna be a Thumbs down.
i pretty much exclusively play the operations Mode, as i did the Hordemode in SM1.
and i do not like where the Patch Trend is going.

right now you require Armory Data (upgrade item) from Difficulty 3 and 4 if you wish to Upgrade your weapon and/or Advance the weapons Perktree.
so if you struggle on Dif. 2, you have to fight through an EVEN HARDER mission(Dif3) to upgrade your weapon to a point where you can enjoy Dif.2

the Perktree has the same issue, you need to unlock and max out each weapon in the Weaponclass to max out the Perks related tot he weapon. some of them completely altering attacks (Combat Knife) or adding additional Attacks (Thunder Hammer)
so to enjoy the weapon to the fullest you are forced to play a Dif you may not enjoy.

with Patch 3 they adjusted the Difficulty in a good way. Patch 3 made the Assault Class playable for non-sweaty people. i greatly appriciated that. but Patch for went in the other direction, including such sentences as ""too easy"" from the Devs.

that sounds like this game will not develop in a direction i will enjoy.
and until i see a different trajectory i will leave this as a ""Not recommended"" review.

i dont know why Developers seem to desperatly try to copy the Souls games.
Warhammer 40k is a Franchise about Powerfantasies. SM1 understood that.

I understand that there are players who have mastered all difficulties and for those players, a new, higher difficulty was implemented. Why punish those players who were fine with the game as it was? I sincerely hope lessons were learned from Helldivers.

To those who react to what I said above by telling me to ""get gud"" or leave the game:
I am still learning and I know I have much to learn still. But as said, Im just a casual dude who plays some operations in the evening with friends and not the best player out there. I wonder who those balance changes are aimed at: the elite of the best players who are bored or a larger portion of the player base.

Theres no denying it: I am severely pissed off. Just got my first fencing weapon, played some really intense operations and barely made it, only to get the thing that made it possible get nerfed the next day.

Also, from consuming content very experienced players created, I understand that once you have perfected your parry timing, you go back to balanced weapons anyways because of their better stats. So the best of the best arent even affected by that change. Its rather kicking away the crutch of those who need it. Telling them to just keep dying until they have perfected their timing. Which does not sound like fun progression. In a cooperative game anyways.",2024/10/18,en

爽，又没有完全爽。

爽的部分是画面，对于40K世界的视觉呈现足以喂饱IP粉丝。

没有完全爽的部分是玩法内核，我强烈怀疑开发者是不是有某种特殊XP，导致他们能做出如下的游戏特点：

1.喜欢看别人打炮，自己打手枪。嗯，大家看我都做出主战坦克和无畏的模型了，但是抱歉，玩家你只能看着他们开炮，看着大部队火拼。轮到你玩的时候，我善意的施舍了十几只虫子给你练练枪法，至于远处的虫潮和坦克大炮只是背景板。

2.要高潮了？给我憋回去！虽然一次只有十几只虫子给我练手，但有一说一，处决机制还是很爽的，尤其是当我一顿操作于乱军丛中锯人首级的时候。此时的我肾上腺素爆发，人甲合一，边喊着“还有谁？！”边寻找下一个目标血祭帝皇，可等待我的往往是一个长按E键开启后黑屏读盘的大门，或者一个长按E键等待十几秒升降的电梯。这该死的节奏控制，好比片中的老师刚喊一声雅蠛蝶，男主就真的停手提裤走人了。

Really Bad: playing solo campaign on veteran and can barely get through any set pieces without dying 100 times and is not skill issue. They did not play their own game to see that combat, while looking great, is derpy af

Will talk about it on core, i hope they see this or hear it, I really like this game but the combat makes it hard to love. will edit review and switch to thumbs up once combat is fixed but I'm super tilted by the sloppy combat in this game.

1) getting pummeled at range while having no cover sucks and we’re no dodge ninjas. Range damage should be hella lowered. I'm busy dealing with the problem in CQC. if they wanna pepper me while i'm in there -- fine. If they improve the health return mechanic maybe its less of an issue, but its just not fun getting peppered relentlessly while I'm in a scrum. I realize it maybe more realistic, but is video game who cares.

2) parry need to cancel current action and take priority over all other moves (except executes aka glory kills), and it needs to be generous with direction and timing. We have hoards of dudes crawling into our butts. It may not be realistic but it feels good video game wise — doom 2016 and eternal does this super well with glory kills. Doesn’t matter if I’m reloading or scratching my nuts I press glory kill and I glory kill. Executes already does this in game, parries should do this as well

3) I find myself parrying even if there is no blue circle. Let parries just work — like Arkham games. the number of times a sword guy does an non-blue non-red attack and I parry only for the game to derp and I get hit anyway is massively aggravating. I could have been spamming attack, but when I spam attack, there's a blue circle and I'm in an attack anim and can't parry. This isn't some fighting game where misreads are punished. Let the players parry. The animations looks sick for it I want to spam the parry-gun shot follow up all freakin day man.

4) The game only lets you self heal on glory kill when you have white health. White health lasts like 0.000001 seconds. Get rid of white health, it's dumb. All executes should just self heal. This will let us tank the range damage we're getting pummelled by when we are in a melee scrum. Medkits can then and should be saved for ranged encounters (where executes aren't available).

5) Armor is weird and makes little sense. Make it one bar or just get rid of it. I don't remember needing it in SM1 and I'm not even sure what is does except go away quickly and never come back.

6) mission set pieces seem to be designed for 3 players… a) set piece mechanic b) hordes of melee c) ranged minions. In solo, I can’t use 3 different weapons at the same time. Example is the rat fight -- I can't shoot the flame thrower, the ranged drones, and the damn sword guys all at the same time. The moment I swap to plasma gun/sword the rat turbines trip me on to the ground and do 1000000 damage. like did you need play these missions solo and go ""man sure seems like some cheap ♥♥♥♥ players will love this""

7) exacerbating this problem is the number of times I see ai teammates just standing there, or take a few pot shots at a baby tyrannid while a set piece mission objective is going up in smoke made me put down the game. Again, during rat missions there are drones that need to be taken out, and rats to keep at bay. Since the AI can't be bothered to use the flamethrower, I gotta keep rats at bay. What are my AI buddies doing? Shooting rats. Either make them be more effective at helping or make the set piece stuff make sense for solo play.

I actually love a lot about this game and want to play it more but combat and poor combat encounter design leaves too much to be desired right now and the game is frustrating.",2024/9/7,en

Simplemente hermoso, ahora que te resumí el juego en dos palabras hoy aprenderemos a hacer tortitas:

Ingredientes:
.-1 vaso leche
.-1 vaso harina
.-1 cucharada aceite de oliva virgen
.-1 cucharada generosa levadura Royal
.-1 poquito sal
.-1 cada azúcar avainillado
.-1 huevo

Pasos:

Paso 1
Batir muy bien el huevo. Yo batí primero la clara y luego la yema.
Paso 2
Añadir todos los ingredientes en el bol y seguir batiendo sin parar. La masa irá cogiendo fuerza y se hará espesa.
Paso 3
Ponemos el bol con papel film y metemos 5 - 10 minutos en el congelador para no tener que dejar la masa reposando para que luego salgan esponjosas.
Paso 4
Mientras preparamos la sartén, el plato y la mantequilla.
Paso 5
Sacamos la masa. Pasamos un poco de mantequilla por la sartén con papel de cocina. Echamos una cucharada grande de masa en la sartén.
Paso 6
Esparcimos la masa hasta el tamaño que nos gusten (las tortitas).
Paso 7
Le damos la vuelta a la tortita, se dora por el otro lado y… Al plato.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 to gra Akcji stworzona przez Studio Saber Interactive .
W grze sterujemy Kapitanem Titusem członkiem zakonu Ultramarines który był również główną postacią w Space Marine 1.
W Space Marine 2 gramy 200 lat po Wydarzeniach Pierwszej części.
System walki jest świetnie zrobiony, podczas Wojny z potworami będziemy korzystać z Pistoletów, Karabinów jak i Mieczy Łańcuchowych lub Noży.
Bronie mają mało Amunicji więc podczas walki Dynamicznie zmieniamy jak walczymy, czasem walczymy z Odległości a 5 sekund później przecinamy naszych wrogów Mieczem.
Gra posiada 3 Tryby: Kampania, Operacje i Wieczna Wojna .
W Kampanie możemy grać Solo lub w Co-Op'ie z dwoma znajomymi, tak samo jest w Operacjach możemy w nie grać Samemu lub w Co-Op'ie.
Tryb to tryb PvP w którym mamy 3 typy meczy: Przejęcie Terenu, Przejęcie i Kontrola i Anihilacja.
Podczas gry Online do wyboru mamy 6 Różnych klas postaci które różnią się Bronią którą walczą jak i Umiejętnościami Specjalnymi.
Klasy do wyboru to czyli każdy znajdzie coś dla siebie od Walki na Odległość Snajperem po walkę w Zwarciu Ostoją.
Co muszę również pochwalić w tej Grze to Oprawa Graficzna i Krajobrazy, wszystko jest pięknie zrobione i daje nam ten Feeling świata Warhammer'a.
Co mnie również cieszy jest to że Wersja 1.0 gry jest Bardzo Dobrze Dopracowana i nie mamy tutaj takich problemów jak przy wielu innych nowych grach.
Jak dla mnie gra jest Świetna, napewno bede dużo w nią grał i czekał na Kolejne Update'y ponieważ Roadmap na Kolejne 2 Lata wygląda Super.

Troll,1,204.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998909434/,"Как человек, который по работе пишет на SSL [Saber Script Language] игру я конечно порекоммендую)
Но только фанатам вахи. Если вы не знаете, кто такие космические десантники, то ждите скидку.
Плюсы:
+ Визуал [Весь. Окружение, проработка уровней, стиль противников скриптовые сцены, например, с падающим колоколом - все это выглядит круто. Но судя по потерям и финальным сценам - сильно больше роты на корабле катается. И почему капитан Акеран щеголяет не в грависе, а в фобос арморе, даже при высадке на планету с тяжелым сопротивлением - загадка. Хотя, новый канон - это новый канон. Верните Като Сикариуса, настоящего капитана 2 роты ультрамаринов!]
+ Пафос [Ты играешь за сверхчеловека! Где-то один усатый дядя перевернулся в гробу от восторга. А сцена с обороной горки от соседских пацанов - топ эпик. Добивания врагов - сочные, ты реально руками разрываешь всяких ксеносов]

На этом плюсы наверное и заканчиваются, начинаются минусы:
- Отвратительное управление. Первые 2 часа я пытался играть на стандартном управлении, в итоге плюнул на это дело и поменял почти все хоткеи на другие. Лучше не стало. Игра заставляет тебя использовать рукопашный бой, но для удара у тебя всего 1 кнопка, для парирования и блока также одна кнопка. Ну и перекат, куда без него, тоже 1 кнопка. Прерывание анимаций как-бы есть, но не во всех последовательностях. Иногда ты слишком рано нажал парирование, и получаешь за это по лицу. Иногда ты лишний раз ударил, уже не можешь отменить анимацию атаки, и получаешь по лицу. То есть отзывчивости в управлении нет [как, например, в верме, дарктайде или дип коке, где в любой момент ты можешь свапнуть оружие, поставить блок, прервав свою атаку и так далее].
Ну ладно, допустим ты ошибся и получил в лицо один удар, да? Да ведь, игра, я получу ОДИН удар за свою ошибку?! Нет, игра считает, что если ты получил удар, то тебя надо ввести в состояние стаггера, в котором тебя продолжают бить, продлевая твой стаггер. То есть 1 пропущенный удар в толпе вполне может закончиться твоим падением на пузико и криками: ""Братик, я упал, подними меня"".
Кто-то может сказать: ""Ну, не получай удары"". Но Я считаю, что подобное управление в 2024 - это просто издевательство, я вроде не в азиатский соулслайк играю, чтобы меня за одну невовремя нажатую кнопку клали.
Отсюда вылезает вторая проблема:
- Баланс в пве. То есть тебе почти нет смысла драться в мили, проще постоянно перекатываться и изредка между перекатами делать выстрел. А что умеет делать сильный выстрел между перекатами? Мельта! При этом она имеет талант, который позволяет вернуть хп, которое было у игрока секундой ранее. Но также она чуть-чуть хилит, если она прокачена. Точнее по задумке чуть-чуть, а по факту: если тебя ударили и пробили твое хп до нуля, то один выстрел из мельты в толу вернет все твое здоровье. И это не белое здоровье из вермы, которое со временем уйдет. Это вечное здоровье.
Играть с болтерами после этого нет никакого смысла. Ибо даже если убрать отхил у мельты, она все равно за 1 выстрел способна сжечь толпу, в то время как из болтера даже хурму или термагантов вы будете расстреливать обоймами. Про элиту даже молчу, не смешно, реально резиновые пульки для разгона тиранидов.
- Мало карт как для пве, так и для пвп. 3 карты для пвп - это смешно. Просто приедается. 6 операций для коопа, вроде бы неплохо, но они не сбалансированы по времени и сложности. Есть легчайшая инферно, которую можно соло с ботами проходить за 20 минут и остальные 5 карт по часу, которые вы пройдете 1 раз для галочки и может быть перепройдете другу тоже для галочки или покекать. И все. От инферно начинает тошнить примерно после 10 перепрохождений. А предстоит их вам много.
- Прокачка. 6 классов, оружия маловато, болтеры по сути ничем не отличаются друг от друга. Стандартное дерево перков, выбери 1 из трех, и так 8 раз. Никаких престижей, докачал персонажа до 25 лвла - теперь выфармливай скины. На максимальные скины нужно около 35-40 игр, зависит от класса, кому-то побольше, кому-то поменьше. Докачал скины - можешь выкидывать персонажа и брать другого. На оружии тоже есть прокачка, в виде дерева. Пока оружие серое - оно вообще не стреляет. Когда становится рыжим - начинает стрелять резиновыми пульками как в глоке. Ну кроме мельты, она даже серая что-то может. В текущих реалиях нет смысла качать что-то кроме мельты, надеюсь, это исправят, причем, не понерфив мельту, а усилив болтеры. Иначе будет грустно расстреливать губки для урона [Точнее просто перекатываться никого не убивая]. Я конечно не ждал глубокой системы прокачки, но получилось вообще максимально стандартно.
- Сюжет. Нет, я понимаю, что когда люди смотрят марвел, то они не ждут сюжета, а просто смотрят на приятную картинку. Когда люди играют в см, они просто играют за космоморяка на пафосе. Но сюжет тут реально вторичен. Отдельное внимание хочется уделить диалогам. Точнее хотелось бы, чтобы это внимание диалогам уделили, но не получилось. Диалоги с Титом в компании проработаны хорошо. Но вот все второстепенные диалоги можно смело заменить на тишину. И будет даже лучше. Ну то есть диалоги уровня: ""Братик, спасибо, что направляешь мой прицел, что бы я без тебя делал"". ""Да, я такой"". ""Не зазнавайся"". Они вообще спейсмарины, элита элит империума на спецзадании, от которого зависит судьба этого мира [планеты] или тинейджеры, которые вышли на прогулку за хлебом? Интересно, что там кодекс ультрам говорит про бесконечный ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ не по делу и забивание эфира своими помехами?
А про срывающие башни у ультрамаринов - это вообще отдельная песня. Они как бы не кровавые ангелы и не космические волки, у которых от вида битвы может сорвать крышу, и они войдут в рейдж. Они должны быть образцом спокойствия, а не психующими мальчиками. Они должны быть молчаливы и лаконичны, а не болтать в объеме этого обзора. Тем более, что один из напарников - сержант. Кто-то может прочитать ваховику, и сказать, что это же 2 рота, они всегда бросаются в бой там, где другие бы отступили. И я соглашусь, предложив прочитать им на абзац ниже, где сказано, что они так делают не потому, что безрассудны, а потому что уверены в своем превосходстве и своей подготовке. А не прыгнуть в толпу гаргуш и хурмы, потерять пистолет и почти умереть смертью глупых. Постоянно спорить со своим лейтенантом и пытаться его застрелить. В общем, понятно, почему Тит ходит таким хмурым. Я бы на его месте тоже предпочел взвод кадианцев, а не двух болванов-младенцев, за которыми нужно следить как за детьми, параллельно спасая планету.
В общем, замени космодесант на любой другой сеттинг - ничего не изменится в этой игре.
- Наверное, самый главный минус этой игры - технический. Это сетевое соединение. Постоянные реконнекты, с выгрузкой/загрузкой на баржу, 140 ошибка, вечный загрузочный экран - все это очень больно видеть. Особенно бесит сетевой код в пвп, где ты уходишь за стенку, а через секунду умираешь, так как пинг тебя догоняет.

Итог: игра неплохая, кампания реально зашла, пафос вывозит большую часть несостыковок. Да и закрываешь глаза на многое как фанат вахи. Тем более, что по вахе нормального уже давно ничего не выходило. Я бы дождался фикса технических проблем, возможно, фикса баланса. И если баланс пофиксят в нужную сторону, то смело можно брать. А там глядишь и скидка подъедет",2024/9/25,ru

Shine,1,90.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058288611/,"Game is fun, exceptionally so.
Thankfully the devs are walking back on trying to balance the game vastly into the ruinous power's favor. Still plagued with numerous issues from crashing, networking, matchmaking, and the like.

Some of the weakest weapons are receiving a small amount of attention, making it seem like they're not afraid of making the game too hard, but afraid of making it too fun.

Hopefully the perk systems are addressed, as a majority of the traits are either wrong to take against one of its competitors, or flat out not doing anything.

The worst part of the game is the class restricting matchmaking, tossing you into games where you possibly cannot play 2 of the classes, with no way to ensure you end up playing what you want, outside of maintaining a private lobby.",2024/10/18,en

实际应该也是近乎完全面向粉丝的作品= =
对于普通玩家来说比较蛋疼的点就不少了
总的来说还是可以玩的

首先世界观来讲……
个人完全不懂战锤世界观，
对于游戏里突然冒出的特殊名词都是一脸茫然，
游戏里也没有相应的解释或者百科全书之类的东西= =
这方面对于新玩家确实不太友好
不过可以直接理解成扮演一个全副武装的钢铁壮汉，
要去干翻波涛汹涌的外星怪物就好XD
也会有一些壮观的大场面
单纯喜欢这个风格的玩家倒是也可以只为此来玩
（就是作为全副武装的钢铁壮汉来说感觉也太纸防了一点……
单纯为了爽的话还是建议简单难度可能比较好）

至于剧情方面倒是挺直接的，
很典型欧美电影展开，反正主角是最正确的，
早听主角的要求就能解决问题没那么多事了的感觉。
然后黑叔叔偏正派，白人大背头队友让人不爽也很典。












游戏性方面只能说还过得去，
不同近战武器有不同的攻击模组，又有不少远程武器可供选择，处决也挺爽挺帅的。
再加上引导很好，也没什么蛋疼解密，不用担心卡关
战斗能接受的话基本上就是全程爽玩过去了。
（但是存档的位置比较奇葩……
在飞船上的时候最好是在最开始就进支线任务战役，
别主线对话到一半再去进，否则这一章节的主线只能从头开始）
其余就是一些BUG，莫名掉帧，敌人突然消失瞬移，程序突然卡死弹出啥的，
还有部分关卡，比如说那个需要用火焰喷射器的关卡玩起来特别难受，
火喷在敌人身上一点儿喷到的感觉都没有……
这些毛病会很影响体验，而且遇到的情况还不少。

然后就是音乐和音效方面，
这个个人觉得是真心不太行了……
音效本身其实还好，就是有时候该大的声音却不大，违和感有点强，
可是部分音乐经常包含些奇怪的鼓声钢铁声轰鸣声，会和战斗时的音效混杂在一起，
加上各种声音时大时小= =
就导致语音，音乐，音效三者各种大大小小的声音混在一起时，
经常会给人特别杂乱的感觉（也可能是我开的不是英配的缘故？）
是难得我甚至想因为声音体验扣分的游戏……
（但是打上头也不用在意这些毛病）

Takioto,1,29.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/takioto/,"Esse jogo me proporcionou uma das melhores experiências com games em 2024!

Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 nos entrega algo que está escasso hoje em dia: diversão e momentos de admiração. É daqueles jogos que te deixam arrepiado com seus cenários ricos e cheios de história. E já vamos começar por aí: a ambientação desse jogo é incrível! Recomendo, às vezes, parar durante as fases e observar tudo ao seu redor. Parece que cada pedacinho diante de você tem uma história. Cada pedra, parede, e árvore. Olhe para o céu, veja essas construções... parece que elas querem te contar algo que testemunharam há anos. Esse tipo de detalhamento é raro nos jogos de hoje. Recentemente, li uma matéria sobre as pessoas envolvidas em Warhammer, e elas realmente demonstram entusiasmo com os projetos e criações. Estão felizes fazendo isso. E, caso você não saiba, Warhammer é gigante, especialmente la na gringa.

Agora, vamos falar sobre a lore dessa franquia, que é densa, cheia de história, personagens e cenários com um peso gigantesco, o que torna a obra ainda mais completa. Mas se você não tem familiaridade com o universo ou ouviu falar pouco dele, não se preocupe. Eu também não tinha, comecei a me interessar recentemente, porque o jogo me proporcionou essa curiosidade. Já existem excelentes criadores de conteúdo brasileiros abordando o tema. Space Marine 2 é uma continuação direta do primeiro jogo, onde controlamos o protagonista Titus. Mas não se preocupe, não é necessário jogar o primeiro game. Se você quiser jogar, beleza, mas na minha opinião, o segundo jogo é uma excelente porta de entrada para esse universo gigantesco.

Sobre a jogabilidade: no começo, os controles parecem confusos, mas com o tempo você se acostuma, e tudo cai como uma luva. O combate é frenético e desperta bastante adrenalina quando você enfrenta hordas de inimigos. Tudo isso enquanto grandes explosões acontecem, o céu está recheado de inimigos e aeronaves em combate constante, e o cenário está desmoronando. É uma verdadeira guerra.

A campanha é ""curta"", mas tem o tamanho ideal para deixar aquele gostinho de ""quero mais"". Melhor assim do que ficar arrastada, cheia de enrolação como muitos jogos por aí que tentam vender a ideia de uma campanha gigante. Na minha opinião, ela está no ponto certo.

Em relação ao desempenho, joguei no PC com uma configuração mediana. Possuo uma RTX 2060 e posso dizer que fiquei sempre acima dos 70 FPS, usando o DLSS no modo qualidade. Fiz algumas pesquisas antes de adquirir o game e só vi elogios quanto à otimização. Sim, o jogo está bem otimizado e já prometeram melhorias em futuros updates. Não tenho muita informação sobre o desempenho nos consoles, então fico devendo.

Falando em updates, o jogo já tem um roadmap mostrando uma prévia do que está por vir. Novas operações, novos inimigos, armaduras, classes, armas, e muito mais.

A campanha pode ser jogada em coop com mais dois amigos. Mas o mais divertido de jogar em grupo são as operações. O jogo também tem um modo PvP, embora eu não tenha jogado muito ainda. Vou explorar mais depois.

No geral, Warhammer 40k Space Marine 2 está sendo uma experiência excelente, e eu recomendo demais! É ótimo ver que ainda existem jogos assim. Se você tiver um dinheiro sobrando, compre e se divirta!

Pelo Imperador!

[BLOP] Misanthropy-AU,0,125.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006448215/,"Cannot recommend the game in it's current release state.

Pros first off, followed by cons.

1: the game actually runs well at high framerates, optimization isn't a big issue here.

2: Gunplay & TTK are good. Recoil can be felt, guns feel good to use. not some shoddy CoD shooter with 0.2s hipfire spray TTK. The Player's ability to aim well is rewarded here.

3: The game's audio feels meaty, heavy and (relatively) realistic & believable.

4: PvE Melee combat. can't say much about it because i prefer to shoot things, but it works well in PvE. feels like they've combined valheim with dark souls.

5: Customization. Follows pretty closely from space marine 1 but with further improvements. Some of the best of any Warhammer game i've played.

6: Environment. The maps are pretty with effort and work put into them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons.

1: PvE Co-op/Campaign ques are still bugged for me personally, though they work for most people. i am unable to start any PvE or campaign game of my own due to the bug of being left on the battle barge with no UI after a black screen. - The solution proposed by a comment in the review Does work, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still bugged.
(Edit 9/09/2024)

2: PvP Que limitations. can only bring at most two friends into PvP. on the upside you can't guild stack PvP lobbies.

3: PvP Class Balance: i'm just gonna say it. mid at best. at higher levels the JPA's practically worthless. The Bulwark's relegated to using their flag ability and is otherwise worthless. Melee's just plain bad.

4: Lack of content. the main campaign is extremely short taking only a few hours to complete. There are 8 replayable PvE operations which is where the bulk of this game's content is. Shares similarities to killing floor where the only differences are as you get stronger via weapon upgrades, class & weapon perks, you simply up the difficulty instead of doing something new. if you don't care much for that, you could play through all of the game's content within half a day.
on a personal level i preferred the wave survival of the first space marine. less walking, less talking. more shooting.

5: PvE AI Squaddies. while they do have some nice features like leaving executes for the player when the bot doesn't need the armor regeneration, they overall fall short. they're not great at fighting back against the hordes, and most of the time don't cover you when your stuck doing objectives that leave you defenceless.

6: Class selection limitations - Done for balance reasons that i can certainly understand, however there's no support for people that want to play a specific class. No ability to pre-select the class you desire to play prior to queuing, and having MM filtered to suit your selection.

7: Easy Anti-Cheat. it's awful and players have already cracked it. Players running around with infinite grenades & trainer like cheats etc.

8: Lack of Shoulder camera swap for PvP. It's all about right angle peaks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TL:DR - Overall it's a solid core game. once the release bugs get ironed out and some more content comes out i could definitely recommend this. just not in it's current release state.",2024/9/6,en

Одна из лучших игр по вселенной Warhammer 40000. Даже в том случае, если вы со вселенной не знакомы - ничего страшного: это отличная точка входа как для новичков, так и для фанатов оригинальной настолки.

Фактически, это олдскульный экшен практически лишённый всего лишнего. Здесь нет бесполезных веток прокачки (только в кооперативе), нет набившего оскомину крафта, нет стелса в кустах и прочего мусора, который всем надоел. Вместо этого есть яростный, адреналиновый ""коридорный"" экшен, который по уровню жестокости не уступает перезапущенной DOOM. Space Marine 2 - это отличная, сконцентрированная игра, которую можно пройти за пару вечеров и получить нереальный уровень фана в процессе.

В общем, всячески рекомендую. А если есть парочка друзей - то рекомендую вдвойне, ведь в кооперативе эта игра становится ещё круче.",2024/9/6,ru

Racoins,1,57.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RacoonSpanky/,"Спасибо Saber Interactive.

- Лучший кооперативный шутер-слешер за всё время, последний выходил в 2011, правда без кооператива!
Моё знакомство с Warhammer 40,000 было с Rites of War, Dark Crusade, Fire Warrior.
Факт заключается в том, что этим играм уже более двадцати лет (а некоторым уже и четверть столетия) и за всё время хороших игр по WH40K, насчитываются единицы.
Я очень ждал что такие ощущения которые я испытываю проходя SM2, мне подарят ребята из ""толстой акулы"", но Darktide со своим мультиплеером долго меня и моих друзей не удержал, увы не справился.
- Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 вызывают исключительно положительные эмоции которые я не смогу описать (попробую), мне как не фанату серии тяжело душнить по этой вселенной ""что убить Малецептора, должно быть как в настолке"", всё остальное нелор/неканон/ересь тд тп. Я не такой, я не гидрадоминатус.
- Для меня и моих друзей, с которыми я прохожу сейчас компанию на самом сложном режиме ""АНГЕЛ СМЕРТИ"" всё выглядит потрясающе, к слову, они оба отлично разбираются во вселенной WH40K, говорят что сделано всё невероятно, что Saber удалось передать ""ту"" атмосферу сорокового тысячелетия, подмечают мелкие детали, о которых я никогда не знал.

Это 10 из 10

- Боевая система. SM2 по нажатиям кнопок практически не изменилась со времён первой части и это отлично, интуитивна и понятна (если что есть подсказки в быстром меню).
В мили боёвке мне понравились парирования, уклонения, фокус цели, некая система битвы с боссами и мини боссами в перемешку с быстрым переключением на тяжелый болтер-пистолет, создаёт невероятную динамику боевой сцены, пока я отрываю ксеносам всё что у них болтается, я могу во время этой сцены покрутить головой и посмотреть чем занимаются мои Братья по оружию, которые вместе со мной занимаются тем-же чем и я, отрывают то, что плохо болтается, ну или отстреливают. Во благо Бога нашего Императора. Боёвка невероятно динамичная (говорю о сложности ""АНГЕЛ СМЕРТИ"").
- Звуки. Выстрелы из мельта орудий, разрывные снаряды болтеров всё звучит привычно, громко, сочно, я это уже слышал, но я не устану это слушать дальше. Спасибо Адептус Механикус за реликвии прошлого. В бою рёв разрывающихся снарядов трёх Astartes снова создают смачную картину жатвы, для меня в игре звук именно выстрелов очень важный аспект, здесь в SM2, Saber накрутили очень высокого качества звук оружия, тишину на Кадаку и треск сверчков, одно удовольствие прерывать гулким, одиночным выстрелом из тяжелого болтер-пистолета.
- Картинка. Никаких RTX, выставленные источники света, будь то тёмный бункер, будь то задымлённое болото от спор Тиранид, космические скайбоксы создают объём коридорным локациям, детализация оных, коме шуток, вот сейчас снова обрисовываю картинку, детализация повторюсь, сумасшедшая, куда не брось глаз по экрану: везде что-то валяется, будь то кусочек уже не понятно кого из Астра Милитарум, Тиранид, просто коробок, мусора, докучи всего, высокого разрешения очень много, одну броню Ультрамарина разглядывать большое удовольствие. Низкополигональных текстур очень мало (надо ходить в фоторежими как я и высматривать их, тогда да, найти можно), но поверьте на такой скорости игры вы никогда их не увидите.
- Геймплей. Для начала, мне нравится здесь ходить, правда, ощущения что ты 400 килограммовая машина смерти, которая бегает по полю битвы непередоваемые, понятное дело ведь студия Saber Interactive использовала наработки Шьямы Педерсена - это автор анимационного фильма про космодесантников Империума ""Astartes"". А вообщем и целом - это кооперативный шутер с сюжетной составляющей и с дополнительными миссиями за других Космических десантиков которые вы вольны выбирать в главном меню (после прохождения основной операции в компании), открывается возможность расширить кусочек сюжета, таким образом здесь уже можно собрать себе кого угодно, если вы были знакомы с прошлой игрой от Saber ""WarZ"", то система улучшений и прокачки вам будет знакома, если нет, понять её не так сложно из трёх способностей в ветке, выбираем одну из, улучшить щит на 25% здоровье/урон и тд. Кастомизация и ""покраска минек"" весьма порадовала, кого угодно можете забацать, Саламандру? Пожалуйста, Храмовника? Да во благо господа нашего Императора там кого угодно можно сделать, хоть с силовой перчаткой и щитом, хоть с тяж. болтером и цепным мечом.
Точка А, точка Б, хилки, боссы, бафы друг другу поставить знамя (чтобы пополнить щит), подсветить противника и многое другое.
Всё это перекочевывает в мультиплеер как в первом SM, захваты флагов, удерживание точек в PVP и тд.


- Два раза за прохождение на релизе был обрыв соединения с сервером, пришлось переподключать лобби с Боевым Братьями, отнюдь, сейчас не Dark Age of Technology, имеем то что имеем, но это не портило нам с ребятами кооп прохождение, момент с лифтом попытался это сделать (что за лифт спойлерить не буду), но там не спавнился ящик с боезапасами и стимами/хилками, т.е. они отображаются (стимы), хилки местные, но взять мы их не могли, это ещё сильнее усложняло наши похождения на 4м уровне сложности. Графических багов, звуковых, обнаружить не удалось. Если удастся, атмосфера и всё остальное что я перечислил в пунктах выше минусов, затмевает моё адекватное восприятие к этой потрясающей игре.

Игра прикольная но если ты хочешь чисто в соло играть

В PVP кроме моих рук из жёпы не было замечено багов и неполадок

ОГРОМНЫЕ МИНУСЫ:

Ужасающий сетевой код:
Подключение к игрокам кое как работает, то ты можешь подключится, то начинаешь молится всем богам машин, танцевать танцы с бубном что бы просто зайти к друзьям.

Оптимизацая шейдеров и текстур: []
Почему на Geforce 2050 которая у меня тянет среднии-высокие настройки без единого лага, во время игры, то текстур нет и просто всё невидемо и ты пинаешь воздух воздухом и умераешь от воздуха и даже переход на низкие настройки с рендорингом УЛЬТРОСКРОСТЬ всё так же, пинаю воздух воздухом.

МЕХАНИКИ:

Ближний бой:
НАХРЕНА ЕЩЁ ОДНА КНОПКА ДЛЯ ПАРИРОВАНИЯ, (предлогаю) сделайти парирование на просто нажатый в тайминг кнопку атаки в ближнем бою как в первой части, я получаю пиздюля от того что парирование не может заблокировать удар и меня гандошит другой таракан с чёпок

Дальний бой:
Болт винтовки и другие типы этого оружия ощущаются на сложностях выше лёгкой, как фонарики у имперской гвардии, хотя от фонариков больше пользы, единственное приемлемое оружие это мельта(Использую как дробовик), плазма винтовка/пистолет и то они чуть-чуть лучше чем болт винтовки, я играю за кого? правильно: астартес который не выходит из-за запоя с дрожащими руками, В прицеле и от бедра снаряды летят куда угодна но не во врага.

Боты тимейты: Таких затупов я не помню когда видел, они на сложности выше средней ничего не могут противопоставить врагам, воскресить не могут, подобрать оружие по лучше немогут, заблокировать атаку не могут, поднять тебя или добить врага - кое как и то не всегда, ты быстрее истекёшь кровью чем они тебя спасут.

Their daily active players dropped off sharply after that. Saber has now done the exact same thing that Arrowhead did.

Substantial difficulty is now harder than Ruthless was before the patch with all the Extremis spawns and other tweaks. Ruthless and Lethal difficulties are inaccessible to someone like me who doesn't have the time to no-life the game and ""git gud."" That leaves me without the ability to progress, and without that I have no incentive to continue playing.

It was fun while it lasted. It's too bad this trend of Dark Souls difficulty fetishism is ruining games. What used to be recreational fun time is now far too intense and serious business. No thanks. I already have a difficult and stressful day job. I don't want or need a difficult and stressful game. I'm too old for that and I'd bet a lot of other 40k fans are, too.

Edit: Todays patch was almost everything I could have hoped for. Saber has proven (at least for now) that they actually listen to their customers and care more about whether we have fun than making sure their game is a torturously difficult Elitists Only gatekeeper circle **** like Helldivers 2 became. The rapid response and decision to roll back poorly designed and hastily implemented changes, with a few reasonable caveats, is appropriate and has returned the game to a state of play that is accessible enough to be inviting and enjoyable and challenging enough to be replayable. With that, Space Marine 2 has earned my positive review and recommendation, but I want to leave off my revised review with some words of caution:

Part of my afformentioned stressful job involves data analysis. Space Marine 2 is a great game that was almost ruined by poor decision making based on what I can only describe as poor analysis. Dmitriy Grigorenko, the Space Marine 2 Game Director, says in the 4.1 patch notes, ""Here was our reasoning before Patch 4.0: When the game came out in September, the Ruthless difficulty win rate hovered around 60%. Weeks later, and with the changes introduced by Patch 3.0, we saw that the same win rate had jumped to over 80%, and we received a lot of feedback stating that the game had become too easy—even at its maximum difficulty (at the time)."" Okay. Win Rate by Difficulty alone is a terrible way to determine whether or not a game is unbalanced unless you are also tracking the overall played time of the specific players involved, the weapons they are using, and the degrees and extents to which they've upgraded their class and weapon perks. Of course win rates on Ruthless jumped by 20% over a few weeks! The players were learning the game, learning the enemies, learning where all the equipment spawns, and progressively unlocking more powerful weapons and abilities! A full team of maxed out players (level 25 with fully upgraded Relic weapons) with over 100 hours played consistently beating the game on the highest difficulty should not be surprising or concerning. It should be expected. On the other hand, a full team of newer players leveling and unlocking their first class and weapon set should find it challenging, but not impossible. Saber seems to have looked at and listened to only the most hardcore addicted players and started tuning the game for that small but vocal group of presumably unemployed extreme gamers who compulsively devoured what was meant to be hundreds of hours of content and then whined when the game we were all still learning and progressing through wasn't hard enough for them anymore after they memorized and mastered every aspect of a game that most of the player base were just beginning to explore. As a result, Saber made PvE progression for newer and more casual players impossible (or at least prohibitively difficult) for a week. That's a really dumb thing for a smart team of developers to do.

I don't know how much data Saber is collecting or the different ways that they may or may not be analyzing that data, but this bit of insight from the Game Director is concerning without additional context. At least they did the right thing by rolling back their and they didn't take forever to do it. Hopefully they will make good on their promise to be more measured in their approach to balancing the game going forward by listening to feedback from more than just the most hyper-aggressive terminally-online game junkies.",2024/10/19,en

Khaio,1,19.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Khaio/,"Análise totalmente voltada para a CAMPANHA do jogo!

Este jogo é uma obra que vai além de ser apenas um jogo de tiro ambientado no espaço. Ao entrar na pele de um dos guerreiros mais temidos e respeitados do Império, senti ao longo do jogo, o fervor que transcende o simples ato de lutar. O jogo me fez sentir como se estivesse em uma verdadeira cruzada, em nome da humanidade, evocando um sentimento de patriotismo e um desejo inato de lutar e de morrer pela luta!

A experiência foi especialmente impactante não apenas pela jogabilidade visceral e brutal (Que vocês todos sabem que tem sido muito raro hoje em dia, tendo apenas Helldivers 2 apresentado algo semelhante ultimamente), mas pelo forte vínculo que se desenvolve entre o protagonista e os NPCs que fazem parte dos seu esquadrão, que realmente são tão heróis quanto o protagonista, não se limitando apenas a personagens secundários que observam o protagonista fazer tudo. Mesmo sendo o foco principal da narrativa, a intensidade com que os NPCs lutavam ao meu lado é tão grande quanto a minha. Os gritos de guerra, suas demonstrações de lealdade e coragem em combate, e a forma como se sacrificam sem hesitar criam uma atmosfera de irmandade inabalável que me emergiu muito dentro do jogo. Em muitos momentos, não me senti apenas como o herói, mas como uma parte pequena de algo maior — uma fraternidade de guerreiros unidos por um propósito comum: proteger a humanidade a qualquer custo.

Os Space Marines não são personagens comuns, e o jogo retrata isso de maneira impressionante. Cada um deles é uma força da natureza, não apenas em termos de habilidades, mas na forma como se entregam completamente ao combate e à missão. Esse aspecto é particularmente poderoso, pois me fez sentir que a responsabilidade da vitória não recaía apenas sobre meus ombros, mas era compartilhada com cada soldado ao meu redor. A fúria deles antes de batalhas decisivas, e a vontade implacável e infinita de continuar lutando, mesmo diante de adversidades insanas, me fizeram sentir que eu era parte de uma causa muito maior do que eu mesmo.

Deixando de lado o que mais me tocou emoção neste jogo, agora falo dos gráficos detalhados que também ajudou a amplificar essas emoções. Cada cenário era certamente muito lindo (Tirava muitos prints ao longo das fases), desde os mundos devastados pela guerra até os sombrios corredores das fortalezas inimigas.

A combinação desses elementos criou uma experiência que eu não havia á muito tempo, e acredito que muitos aqui entendem que não sentem á muito tempo, que é aquela vontade de jogar algo o dia inteiro, gostar cada minuto, e quando acaba, ficamos ""Já acabou?"".",2024/10/15,pt

- Более чем, лейтенант

13 лет назад, первая часть произвела на меня довольно сильное впечатление. Первый шутер по вселенной Вархаммера, который мне очень сильно понравился, где чувствовалась массивность Астартес, где был мощный и сочный звук выстрела из болтера, каких я больше нигде не слышал. Долгое время на вторую часть я даже не надеялся, и вот, спустя 13 лет, снова появилась надежда. Услышать тот самый звук болтера, почувствовать эту массивность, и снова заняться приятным делом - сжигать еретиков, убивать мутантов, избавлять от нечистого. Насколько же получилось?

Несмотря на то, что первая часть вышла давно, хочется немного сравнивать с ней в том числе. Очень похожее вступление, знакомый саундтрек, само повествование - в новой части есть немало моментов, которые были еще в первой, но теперь они куда более современные.

В первую очередь, хочется выделить графику и дизайны локаций. Несмотря на имперскую шаблонность, локации не выглядят пустыми и очень детализированы. Иногда хочется остановиться ненадолго, чтобы разглядеть какой-нибудь вид или баталию вдалеке, или посмотреть и послушать сторонние диалоги. Мир выглядит живым, и теперь это действительно похоже на войну планетарного масштаба, а не на просто прогулку по руинам мира-кузницы.

Отдельно очень хочется выделить искусственный интеллект тиранид. Практически каждый тиранид, которого вы видите, имеет полное право получить снаряд болтера, это не просто анимированный фон. Исключение здесь составляют разве что летающие представители. И этот каждый тиранид хочет вас убить, и это взаимно. При этом они действуют стаями, и если вы разобрались с одной из них и переключили своё внимание на какого-то врага побольше - скорее всего, следующая стая уже уверенно подбирается к вам с фланга или с тыла. Засчет этого, каждая большая комната становится новым испытанием на выживание, и в том числе новой возможностью уничтожить как можно больше ксеносов. Думаю, это и есть пыл битвы, войти в него довольно просто, и это весьма доставлючий процесс.

С искусственным интеллектом напарников чуть сложнее. По крайней мере да, они не для красоты, и точно так же пытаются разобраться с врагом вместе с вами, поднимут вас при ранении, и точно так же проводят добивания (когда уже никого не осталось). Хотя иногда складывалось ощущение, что непонятно, где они, и чем занимаются, и убивают ли врагов вообще. К сожалению, их нельзя кастомизировать, выдать им конкретное оружие, или отдавать приказы, или хотя бы задать какую-то базовую тактику действий. Поэтому у меня сложилось впечатление, что кампания сильно заточена под кооп - проходить игру вместе с двумя боевыми братьями наверняка будет гораздо интереснее.

Сюжет довольно короткий, проходится примерно за 8 часов. И только я начал думать, что он начинает становиться немного скучным, и вроде как всё уже идет к завершению, как этот самый сюжет начал разгоняться аки гравибайк, покрашенный в красный. Отдельные миссии иногда добавляют небольшие отдельные механики, постепенно выдаются новые виды вооружения. В основном это конечно болтеры, которые между собой не то чтобы как-то сильно отличаются, но есть возможность попробовать разные и выбрать себе наиболее полюбившийся. Несколько разных видов оружия ближнего боя, разные виды гранат (что тоже приятно). Успел немного потрогать PvP, сейчас работает немного с трудом, но играется быстро и приятно.

Есть некоторое ощущение этакой шаблонности современных игр - линейность коридоров, это парируй, от этого уклоняйся, периодически убирай преграды. Но самое главное - качество, с которым это сделано. И на мой взгляд, сделано оно очень хорошо. И неплохо оптимизировано - на моём не самом современном железе играется довольно плавно на высоких, без вылетов и без багов. В нашем тысячелетии, уже не каждая игра на релизе может похвастаться подобным.

С учетом того, что есть roadmap, и будут ещё новые карты, оружие и прочее, и игра будет развиваться дальше - в целом, я считаю, что это уже очень и очень достойное продолжение серии. Возможно есть некоторые недостатки, но думаю, они скорее незначительны или субъективны. Надеюсь, что еще останусь в PvP и PvE режимах на подольше. Ибо процесс весьма доставляет

Спасибо вам, Saber. За эту возможность, вернуться немного в прошлое, и за столь красивое настоящее.

[IF-CM] Evoke,0,85.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IF-CM-Evoke/,"Прошел месяц с момента выхода Space Marine 2, так что теперь есть возможность выразить свои мысли об игре, опираясь на полученный опыт, а не на всеобщий хайп.
Прежде всего, от имени старейшего Ордена Имперских Кулаков хочу выразить разработчикам огромную благодарность за новое дыхание, которое они дали всем фанатам Warhammer40k, взявшись за создание Space Marine 2 и, что более важно - доведя дело до релиза. Возьму на себя смелость сказать, что и другие кланы – как ветераны, так и совсем новички – воодушевлены проделанной работой.

Многие кланы решили посвятить долгое время ожидания игры подготовке к предстоящим битвам, ивентам и выстраиванию дипломатических отношений. Исходя из имевшихся объемов информации, кланы во многом рассчитывали на возможность гибкого и многогранного взаимодействия не только между игровыми сообществами, но и между отдельными игроками.

Динамичные миссии, полные врагов Империума, на какое-то время затянули всех игроков. А после того, как фанаты вдоволь насладились режимом PvE и получили массу положительных впечатлений, большой поток игроков перешел на PvP-режим. Здесь же они и столкнулись с огромным рядом проблем, среди которых самый яркий пример – отсутствие стабильного соединения при запуске матчей. Кланы, со своей стороны, эту проблему ощутили в двойном размере – в дополнение к постоянным дисконнектам прибавилась проблема со стабильностью даже простого сбора группы из трех человек.

Прошло уже достаточно времени, однако игроки получили лишь один патч, исправляющий мелкие и незначительные – на общем фоне – проблемы. Данный факт в настоящее время вызывает открытое недовольство среди игроков. Для кланов ситуация в настоящий момент усугубляется тем, что абсолютно отсутствуют инструменты для межкланового взаимодействия и рекрутинга. Если команда разработчиков в процессе создания игры интересовалась историей и опытом оригинального Space Marine, то наверняка знает – во многом активность там поддерживали кланы. И делают это до сих пор. Даже спустя 13 лет в игре присутствуют межклановые ивенты, взаимодействие и активность. Гибкая система настройки приватных лобби в оригинальном Space Marine позволяет собраться командам до 8 человек с каждой из сторон. А простой клик по нику игрока дает возможность апотекариям в короткое время завербовать талантливого игрока в свою команду. В Space Marine 2 ни один из подобных аспектов реализован не был. Мы понимаем, что эта игра не была обещана как полное отражение первой части, но существующая в ней ограниченность в корне убивает создание крепких взаимоотношений между игроками и формирование большого стабильного сообщества фанатов Space Marine 2.

Разработчики предлагают игрокам оставлять на форуме и в Discord отзывы о проблемах в игре, однако никогда не дают конкретных ответов или отчетов о проделанной работе. Зато на просторах Интернета ими вовсю раздаются интервью, всплывают слухи о разработке новых игр. И даже о третьей части Space Marine.

Возможно, это нежелание брать на себя ответственность за судьбу и развитие своего проекта, который удачно «выстрелил» на фоне отсутствия других игр по Warhammer40k. Возможно, мое мнение – ошибка, и где-то в глубине студии готовится к выходу мифический, волшебный, всё исправляющий патч. Но это лишь теории и предположения, которые будут опровергнуты или подтвердятся в будущем.

А мы, игроки, хотим быть услышаны уже сейчас.",2024/10/8,ru

Cuando THQ y Relic Entertainment lanzaron Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine en septiembre del 2011, el juego fue muy bien recibido (sobre todo por los usuarios de PC) a falta de títulos de acción en tercera persona al estilo God of War durante esa época. Diez años después, Focus Entertainment y el desarrollador Saber Interactive anunciaron su secuela Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 durante The Game Awards 2021, marcando el regreso de Demetrius Titus a la Segunda Compañía de los Ultramarines, pero esta vez como teniente, no como Capitán.

Para aquellos que no lo recuerden como también para quienes no jugaron su previa entrega, Titus es reportado por su compañero Leandros al final del primer juego por sospechas de herejía luego de que el honorable capitán sobreviviera a una explosión de Warp, lo cual es muy poco común entre los Adeptus Astartes. A raíz del recelo de su compañero, Titus se ve obligado a someterse a la pesquisa de la Inquisición (para no manchar la reputación de los Ultramarines), pero esta no logra encontrar nada.

Con esto en mente, Space Marine 2 comienza con Titus sirviendo como un Escudo Negro en el singular Capítulo de los Vigías de la Muerte (Deathwatch), la cual está compuesta por veteranos experimentados de otras facciones para combatir especies extraterrestres. Luego de más de cien años de servicio, Titus recibe una herida fatal y renace como un Primaris (un Space Marine más ágil, fuerte y resistente) luego de «cruzar el Rubicón», una frase utilizada como punto de no retorno en la cirugía de transformación de estas gigantes máquinas de matar de dos metros y medio. No obstante, no hay diferencias tangibles entre el Titus del prólogo y aquel convertido en Primaris.

A pesar de su gran devoción por servir al Emperador y su desempeño intachable en el nombre del mismo, Titus es recibido nuevamente por sus hermanos azules con cierta desconfianza por las infundadas conjeturas de herejía del pasado, además de tener que rendir cuenta de sus acciones durante las misiones ya que no siempre siguen al pié de la letra el Codex Astartes, la doctrina por la cual se rigen todos los Marines Espaciales.

Sería el equivalente de un cristiano que sabe interpretar la biblia en tiempos modernos, en vez de estar citando ciegamente palabra por palabra algunos de sus versículos como un fanático religioso. La voz de Titus, ahora interpretada por Clive Standen en vez de Mark Strong, me pareció que encaja mucho mejor con la templanza del personaje, como también en los momentos en que decide actuar según lo que le parece correcto.

Similar a Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine en el cual primero luchábamos contra los Orkos y luego los Chaos Space Marines, en esta secuela el enemigo en principio serán los Tiránidos, pero ya en instancias iniciales de la campaña, los Marines Traidores y su maliciosa energía del Warp serán una vez el archirrival de los Ultramarines. Quizás algunos me odian por este spoiler, pero esto no es necesariamente información nueva. De hecho, un trailer extendido de gameplay de agosto del 2023 (acompañado de nuevas imágenes bastante explícitas) ya revelaban a la facción de Los Mil Hijos (Thousand Sons), quienes actúan al servicio del Dios del Caos, Tzeentch.

Todo esto dejando de lado el hecho de que el juego completo de Space Marine 2 se filtró a mediados de julio de este año, incluyendo no solo la campaña sino también archivos para crear servidores online. Una verdadera catástrofe para el estudio. No obstante, si bien se creía que la build era de junio de este año, representantes de Saber Interactive dijeron que era mucho más antigua que eso, y se pone en evidencia por la falta de escaladores (DLSS de Nvidia y FSR2 de AMD) e incluso el TAA, que sí están en el juego final.

Similar a su predecesor, Space Marine 2 cuenta con un gameplay que combina combate cuerpo a cuerpo con ejecuciones al estilo God of War, con la cámara y el gunplay característicos de la saga Gears of War, ahora mucho más refinados. Si bien la fórmula sigue siendo la misma, la secuela introduce algunas mecánicas que lo hacen más frenético, sangriento y brutalmente satisfactorio, en gran parte gracias al excepcional trabajo en las animaciones que ahora son mucho más fluidas y realistas, y no tienen nada que envidiarle a Kratos en el reboot de God of War del 2018.

Por un lado, Titus ahora no solo puede bloquear ataques y esquivarlos con un dodge (los rojos no se pueden bloquear), sino también hacer un parry a enemigos de tamaño normal, o ejecuciones instantáneas cuando se trata de enemigos pequeños, que son básicamente los Hormagaunts que aparecen de a cientos en pantalla.

El parry, marcado con un halo celeste, no solo nos sirve para evitar un ataque, sino también para estampar a los enemigos más pequeños contra el piso en pos de despejar un poco el área en caso de estar rodeado de decenas de ellos. Igual de importante es utilizar el golpe pesado (que se ejecuta manteniendo el clic derecho al final de un combo) para hacer un pisotón en el piso o otros golpes de gran magnitud según el arma que tengamos equipada (lamentablemente no está la Power Axe, pero si un cuchillo que brinda mucha velocidad).

Similar a Space Marine, la barra de armadura se regenera automáticamente o al realizar ejecuciones, ya sean cuerpo a cuerpo o con la pistola. La salud por otro lado, ya no se cura con finishers, sino que debemos obtener medkits y usarlos. Tanto estos como las cajas de municiones pueden estar ocultos en cajas, así que romper un poco los objetos del escenario no está de más. No suelen abundar demasiado de modo que hay que racionarlos sabiamente como en Left 4 Dead o el otro juego desarrollado por Saber Interactive, World War Z.

En caso de recibir mucho daño y que un porcentaje de la barra de vida esté en blanco, Titus puede recuperar un poco al golpear a enemigos hasta llegar al color rojo. Es una mecánica de riesgo y recompensa, sobre todo en dificultades altas. Como último recurso, podemos activar la Furia de Titus (la cual que también estaba en el primer Space Marine) para regenerar un poco de vida y realizar ataques con mayor daño y velocidad. Los compañeros de Titus (Chairon y Gadriel) también tienen sus propias habilidades activas y pasivas, que definitivamente sirven a la hora de jugar en cooperativo y/o en altas dificultades.

Habiendo jugado la campaña primero en normal y después en difícil (Veterano), recomiendo jugarlo en esta última o la más difícil de todas en caso de que busquen un desafío más significativo. La dificultad Normal es demasiado fácil y es muy raro -pero no imposible- morir si estamos acostumbrados a este tipo de juegos. Nuestros compañeros del squad nos pueden resucitar hasta dos veces antes de recibir una herida mortal (que en caso de caer nuevamente moriremos y tendremos que reiniciar el checkpoint) lo cual lo hace aún más indulgente. La campaña, a lo largo de cinco extensas misiones en los planetas Kadaku, Avarax y Demerium, tiene una duración promedio de 10 horas de juego.

No hay mucho valor de rejugabilidad excepto por los modos de dificultad o en caso de querer ayudar a algún amigo. También está la posibilidad de querer desbloquear el logro de los 32 dataslates (audiologs), para lo cual es necesario jugar la campaña como también el modo PvE. Lamentablemente no se pueden elegir los checkpoints de las misiones, de modo que si queremos jugar un segmento en particular, tendremos que empezar la misión de cero.

背景板大头和泰伦对射 再加上僵尸世界大战同款虫海虫墙，在保证这么多单位的情况下优化甚至还不错
锤粉光凭几个大场景就能直接值回票钱
还有战船上的对话，每关开始前npc的对话都不一样

整体人物性能甚至不如暗潮，暗潮四个刁民怪海游泳 sm2三个原著罐头被小怪围起来汗流浃背
还有暗潮同款超烦人小怪+狙击怪干扰你近战接敌
近战攻击，举枪射击，闪避，格挡全部都有不可取消的硬直，看上去穿了一身罐头，实际韧性极低，被攻击击中会有极大的硬直，最低难度被红光击中就是半条血，一个小怪+一个中型怪就能把你屈在墙角凌辱屈死
你宝贵的两/三格护盾，只在抵挡远程射击时有一定用处，被最基础的小兵近战都会碎掉一格护盾，雷锤的超大蓄力攻击/空中蓄力攻击/钩锁突进 没有霸体 后面两个会被狙击手表演花式坠机，雷锤那么大的硬直真蓄拼刀甚至会被砍回来打断 突出一个便秘
（多人模式下因为生存强绑定战斗和处决 甚至会抢处决，让本来就纸糊的罐头更加纸糊）
在大量接敌小怪时甚至会汗流浃背 最好的办法甚至是避免近战多打远程

所有爆弹系武器的威力都非常有问题（而且都星际战士了还压不住枪是否有点）
对比暗潮里面爆弹枪毁天灭地一样的打击效果，你手里的爆弹枪简直是水弹枪

再结合一下复古的抽象单键位设计:（左键开枪 右键近战 中键开镜 滚轮切换模式/放大倍率 c键瞄准）
局外pve的肝度也有点问题，
武器满级需要最低难度八十场以上，到了解锁关键节点时，需要使用关键道具解锁后面，解锁之前溢出经验直接溢出不累计
结合这个pve关键道具不知道是随机刷新还随机出现位置，需要像暗潮找白书一样舔地图（目前打了6把合作模式只舔到了2个这个关键道具）

多人模式无法重复职业，但是切换职业需要步行五十米去找火星佬切换职业/改配装，不能一键开个界面修改这些
看上去三选一的perk选择不是同时开放给你的，比如说第一排的三选一，第一个二级给你，第二个十级给你，第三个十八级给你，而且解锁以后还需要花费游戏内货币购买
解锁武器也需要花游戏内货币购买，解锁涂装还需要花货币购买（我都买dlc了东西你还让我再游戏里再买一遍？）
而且目前看样子这个货币还只能升级获取
总结一下
如果你是锤粉 那光凭画面就可以值回票价
如果不是锤粉 抛去粉丝向游戏，这游戏目前设计硬伤较多，系统老旧，肝度较高，游戏体验较差，合作地图较少只有六张，想体验怪海游龙不如去隔壁鼠疫或者暗潮",2024/9/6,zh-cn

Are you seriously punishing your player base for having fun and enjoying the game from before? Are trying to role-play a Greek God?

1. You stealth nerfed the dodge distance and invulnerability window, now my space marine felt like he is overweight and hasn't exercise in years. The distance traveled felt unnatural even to the naked eye, its like my character hit an invisible wall as he jumped. The fact that the Developers kept this from us is a big red flag.

2. The new teammate distance mechanic on ruthless and lethal has never been tested before release, you can tell they never take snipers into consideration at all, how can they play their role as range support if they cannot stay back and provide cover fire. And why implement this to ruthless, if you want to provide a challenge for the elites among us, this mechanic should only be in lethal difficult if ever. This is clearly Hubris on the Developers part, and the success of Space Marine 2 have gone to their head.

3. Your current Operation enemy director is not functioning as intended, enemy spawn rate is all over the place even on low difficult. 6 to 7 Majoris drowning a single level 1 to 3 player on Minimal is crazy (I have encounter this multiple times when joining a game). How are new players able to learn if they are getting hammered from the very beginning.

4. Enemies are still able to shoot at my feet and damage me through the elevator floor, imagine getting sniped from underneath the floor plate by a Tyranid 5 secs after the elevator has already left the previous floor. This has been an issue from day one, 4 patches in and still not fix. I do not wish to dodge around like an idiot in the elevator, so how about you fix this immersion breaking bug asap.

5. Lastly I am extremely disappointed with the cosmetic rewards for clearing all 7 missions on lethal. One helmet for all 6 classes? Why not one for each class, the design on that helmet took your team how long to make? An hour? Two? You could have move that damaged look to all of the relic helmets, one for each class, how lazy have you gotten, I have already purchase the season pass, unfortunately in this case, honestly i don't think I will be getting my money's worth if this is the amount of effort for such an achievement.

This review will not effect the current sales of this game, but keep this type of updates and lazy work going, and the next time i see a Saber Interactive game, I will pick any other developers who respects their player base to support.",2024/10/21,en

為帝皇服務
戰錘粉絲最近必買之作

僅此而已了


畫面算漂亮 細看見到角色臉部粗糙 那位紅頭盔一整天面癱 不過整體是合格的

效果音 槍聲單調 不合格

射擊 近戰 打擊感不太足
我都是星際戰士了 我手拿爆矢槍一槍打飛一支最弱的蟲子合理吧 這樣的效果你都不給我 你要是嫌蟲子威脅不夠你就再堆多點小怪給我射阿...
不過槍襲 處決 招架閃避等糸統做得不錯

單人戰役 劇情 關卡設計都算合格
有數關 比如吞噬蟲群的橋段令人印象深刻
而且換了公司製作仍然有致敬前作的橋段(留給大家自己玩的時候發掘了)

可是仍然有不少的痛點 以下的缺點是包含進END GAME的合作模式裡面的

以下開始吐糟

中型精英敵人硬度不合理 幾乎打一整個彈匣的子彈才能擊殺1隻普通精英怪
可是在佈置怪物出生上面 有時候竟然能一次出7-8隻精英 一瞬間沖跨整個隊形再屠殺整個隊伍 而且普通精英的TTK特長 想快速清掉也不行
想不被屠就得拿超模的熱熔槍去打

而且你讓我打一支精英得用一個彈匣 你倒是給我足夠的彈藥阿?!?!?! 爆矢槍210發備彈?!?!?!?!

合作模式拿到的槍 每一級提升追不上怪物的提升 除非你拿新槍到低難度虐菜 不然 拿到新槍到新的關卡沒有升級的快樂回饋
角色專精樹效果不明顯 拜託你跟黑潮學一學好不好??

武器專精的技能樹有很多不合理的 小刀要連殺10個敵人才能發動 怎麼殺??!?!

以上一堆都是根本上讓人玩得不爽的點
讓人懷疑製作方有沒有自己玩過自己的遊戲

以下是設計上的吐糟

關卡路線完全單一連半點可探索性都沒有(當然製作方也沒有做什麼可收集物了...)
而且只有6張圖可以打 誠意呢??? 你看看旁邊的Remnant2?!!?!?

你做這個合作模式 一堆外觀收集物 不妨再弄點裝備讓我們刷阿........

而且為什麼只給3個人一隊?!?!你知道阿斯塔特聖典指示是多少人一隊嗎?!?!
好歹給4個一起阿!!!!!

想不到更多想到再寫

Serving the Emperor
A must-buy for Warhammer40K fans recently

That's all


The picture is pretty good. If you look closely, you can see that the character's face is rough. The one with the red helmet was paralyzed all day long, but overall it's passable.

Effect sound: monotonous sound of gunfire, unqualified

Shooting, close combat, not enough impact
I'm a Astartes. I hold a bolter in my hand and shoot away the weakest insect with one shot. Isn't it reasonable that you won't give me such an effect? If you think the insect is not a threat enough, just add more mobs and shoot them for me. ...
But I did a good job in executing, parrying, dodging, etc.

The single-player campaign, plot, and level design are all considered passable.
Several levels, such as the scene with the swarm of swallowing insects, are impressive.
Moreover, after changing the production company, there are still some parts that pay tribute to the previous spacemarine1 (leaving it for everyone to discover when they play)

However, there are still many pain points. The following shortcomings are included in the cooperation mode of END GAME.

Start vomiting next

The hardness of medium-sized elite enemies is unreasonable. It takes almost an entire magazine of bullets to kill an ordinary elite monster.

However, when arranging the spawning of monsters, sometimes 7-8 elites can appear at once, rushing across the entire formation and killing the entire team in an instant. Moreover, the TTK specialties of ordinary elites cannot be cleared quickly.

If you don't want to be slaughtered, you have to hit me with a supermodel's melta gun.

And you asked me to use one magazine to shoot an elite, but you gave me insufficient ammunition?!?!?! The bolter has 210 rounds of ammunition?!?!?!?!

The guns obtained in the cooperative mode cannot keep up with the improvement of monsters at each level. Unless you get a new gun and reach a low difficulty level, otherwise, there will be no happy feedback from upgrading when you get a new gun and reach a new level.
The effect of the character specialization tree is not obvious. Can you please learn from Warhammer40K:Darktide ??

There are many unreasonable skills in the weapon specialization tree. The knife needs to kill 10 enemies in a row before it can be activated. How to kill??!?!

All of the above are fundamentally unsatisfying points.
It makes people wonder if the producers have ever played their own games.

The following is a complaint about the design

The level route is completely single and there is not even the slightest bit of explorability (of course the producer doesn’t have any collectibles...)
And there are only 6 MAP to play. Where is your sincerity??? Look at Remnant2 next to it?!!?!?

If you do this cooperative mode and have a bunch of appearance collections, you might as well get some equipment for us to grind...

And why are there only 3 people in a team?!?! Do you know how many people a team is instructed by the Codex Astartes?!?!
Anyway, let’s give it to 4 of us together!!!!!

This latest installment in the Warhammer 40K universe sets a new standard for action-packed shooters with its impeccable blend of brutal melee combat, strategic gunplay, and stunning visuals.

From the moment you step into the power armor of a Space Marine, the game impresses with its attention to detail. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking, showcasing the grimdark universe with a level of realism that immerses you completely. The environments are richly detailed, from the war-torn landscapes to the imposing architecture of the Imperium’s strongholds.

The combat is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The gameplay feels both fluid and weighty, with a seamless transition between hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry. The new abilities and upgrades add depth and variety, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and exhilarating. The game’s AI is notably sharp, presenting a formidable challenge that keeps you on your toes without ever feeling unfair.

Narratively, the game excels in delivering a compelling story set against the backdrop of a galaxy in turmoil. The voice acting and script are top-notch, with a storyline that feels both epic and personal. The character development is rich, and the dialogue manages to balance gravitas with moments of dark humor, adding layers to the experience.

Multiplayer has also received a significant upgrade, offering diverse modes and a robust progression system that keeps the action engaging and competitive. Whether you’re battling in co-op missions or competing in PvP, the multiplayer experience is both rewarding and addictive.

In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a masterclass in combining thrilling gameplay with a deep, immersive world. It’s a must-play for fans of the franchise and a standout entry for those new to the universe. This game not only meets but exceeds expectations, proving itself as a benchmark in the genre.

游戏总评：8.5/10
目前100多小时全成就通关，体验下来就是爽快的战斗，一切就是砍，在泰伦虫族中杀出一条血路，战役模式不长，但是体验一下还是挺爽的，场景宏大，战役模式可以跟好友联机通关，但是战役没有任何奖励和属性获得，只是单纯看剧情，战斗派生挺多，近战处决帅气，游戏的大部分内容在PVE的内容上，不过都刷是重复的相同关卡，获取经验升级人物等级和武器等级，如果不喜欢刷的话可能本作的内容体量就比较少了，大概5到10小时左右的战役剧情，目前游戏还是存在问题的，默认按键非常不友好，需要自己重新设定，游戏平衡不算很好，可选武器和能打的职业就那几个，游玩需要把反击练熟练才能有好的游戏体验，PVE内容可以先把盾卫打熟练（用好盾反）后游玩其他职业就很轻松了。

mhenryblack,1,35.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mhenryblack/,"For almost a decade, I wished for a sequel to Space Marine.

I was afraid it would never happen. THQ crashing and burning had left the possibility of a true sequel in limbo. In spite of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, and a fairly large cult following, I had doubt that anyone would pick up the ball, and finish what Relic started.

Then, to my shock, a couple years ago, a trailer drops.

I wanted to shout for joy, but almost instantly, I became skeptical.

Worried that my beloved game could never have the sequel it deserved in our current development culture. The new studio would gut it of what made it's soul, insert contrived modern tropes and disrespect the source and setting.

I have NEVER been so happy to be wrong.

Space Marine 2 is Marvelous. Jaw-Dropping.

Saber has taken Relics Masterpiece to new heights, added new mechanics that enhance the experience and expanded the multiplayer, seamlessly weaving it into the campaign, making it far more interesting and addictive that it's predecessor.

It's BIGGER, BLOODIER and even more BAD*SS.

Titus' story continues, wonderfully connected to the previous installment, ending it's chapter with a promise of more, and leaving me READY for the next sequel. SM2 NAILS the vibe of Warhammer 40k, outright stunning at few moments. The setting and the previous game are treated with reverence and attention to detail.

For hours, I lost myself, engaged, immersed and awestruck at the spectacle, even more so because I had come to believe it would never happen.

Je tiens à préciser que j'apprécie énormément la licence. J'ai poncé le premier opus plus jeune, je dévore les romans, j'aime peindre et jouer sur table. Tout ça pour dire que j'avais de grandes attente et Focus et Saber ont su faire monter la hype.

J'ai pré-commandé le jeux en version Gold sur Pc, Rtx2070, i7-10 etc...
J'ai maintenant 40h de jeux.

Spoil : je ne le recommande pas...

Okay ! le jeux est bien. L'univers est bien rendu. On prend part à de belles batailles. Les combats sont dynamique, c'est gore, il y a du lore, de la personnalisation etc...

Mais... Beaucoup trop de points négatif.

En solo déjà la campagne est trop courte. Douche froide à la dernière mission. Quelques heures de plus aurait été bienvenue pour un projet de cet envergure extrêmement attendu. Les scénariste ont fait un boulot propre, ressemblant aux bouquins mais c'est tout.
Le Gameplay par contre a été vraiment mal foutu et brise complètement l'immersion.
Des murs invisible sur notre chemin. Pressé une touche plus d'une seconde pour ramasser un objet ou activer un bouton. Être obligé de se taper deux ligne de dialogue avant d'ouvrir une porte...
Niveau combat c'est de l'arène. On se met au milieu et on encaisse. Aucune stratégie, pas de couvert. un système extrêmement bancal de bouclier, régénération, exécution, parade qui n'a pas de synergie. Pas de système d'upgrade de notre héros. Certains ennemis deviennent une vraie purge et la masse ne sert pas à grand chose si ce n'est mettre le bordel à l'écran.

La Coop... Bon ! C'est super cool de pouvoir jouer les missions parallèle de l'aventure principal. Par contre où sont les autres missions ? 6 c'est tout ?? Un système d'upgrade qui m'a empli les yeux de larmes après mettre rendu compte qu'il faudrait faire en boucle des missions scénarisé que je n'ai vraiment pas envie de recommencer. Surtout qu'il n'y a pas de lien entre le PvE et PvP...

Le PvP... J'en attendais énormément. Je pensais même qu'il foirerai la campagne pour se focaliser dessus... Ba non. Le système de progression est vraiment mal pensé. Les classe me paraissent déséquilibrés. 3 maps... sérieusement ?? Très peu d'armes et d'armures à déverrouiller et qui n'ont que peu de rapport avec le fait de monter une classe en particulier. PAS DE SKINS POUR LE CHAOS ?!

Franchement il y a une très bonne base pour un bon jeux mais ils n'ont produit que la moitié de ce qui aurait du être attendu. Les graphismes sont ok tier, l'ambiance rattrape le coup mais pas l'optimisation... Le PC en PLS en graphismes moyen.
Il n'y a que des promesses pour la suite (syndrôme Darktide ?) et j'ai beaucoup de mal à y croire.

Premièrement, cela fait plaisir de retrouver l'univers dans un jeu à gros budget. En effet, depuis les déboires du dernier Dawn Of War, les grosses productions étaient frileuses.
En revanche, il y a eu plein de jeux à petits budgets ou indés qui sont des pépites.

Niveau graphisme, c'est vraiment très beau. Je n'ai pas grand-chose à dire de plus, le visuel de l'univers n'a plus rien à prouver.

Coté technique, il est réellement très gourmand en ressources processeur, j'ai eu du mal au début.
i5-8600K
7900XT
16Go RAM

Avant le dernier patch, mon i5 n'en pouvait plus. J'ai quand même plus observé l'efficacité du système de cache du jeu, bravo les devs. En effet, plus je jouais, moins j'avais de problèmes de performances. Cependant, j'ai eu de nombreux crashs à un moment donné en jouant au multi.

Niveau gameplay, c'est un retour dans les années pré 2015. Cela ne conviendra pas à tout le monde, mais la recette est efficace.
Il y a le même esprit que le premier, mais bien amélioré. Je pense aux exécutions qui sont jouissives, l'esquive, la parade, le tir et la parade réflexe. Tout vient naturellement. L'arsenal est assez généreux.

Niveau histoire, c'est dans la lignée du premier, épique, voire vraiment très épique par moments. Du bon W40K, quoi !

Niveau contenu, on reste dans les jeux modernes qui font les paris de tenir ou de faire revenir les joueurs sur un an. Donc, le contenu de base peut paraitre moyennement abondant.

Le multi je n'ai fait que la coop opérations et franchement, c'est réellement sympa à jouer.
Je pense que le jeu va me durer quelques mois, voire l'année, vu le contenu annoncé.

Pour les points faibles. Ayant joué au jeu depuis l'accès anticipé, je dirais :

- Les bugs, c'est chiant, on le répète : ne pas jouer à la sortie.
- Un aspect répétitif dans le gameplay : si tu n'aimes pas, passe ton chemin.
- La sortie des patchs et des features de base tardive, je pense au support de l'ultra-wide.

- Déjà, c'est un jeu couloir et pas forcément des plus intéressants, c'est sympa mais ça devient très très vite répétitif.
- Le jeu ne va rien révolutionner, faut bien le comprendre, c'est un Hack and slash classique.
- Actuellement, j'ignore si c'est uniquement mon cas mais quand même, l'optimisation en dehors du jeu, c'est à dire les chargements, les tentatives de connexion, toussa, sont complètement foireux.
- La personnalisation des personnages, sur-vendue à l'origine, est vraiment pas si poussée que ça, y'a assez peu d'éléments de customisation à débloquer (et ils sont assez longs à débloquer histoire de faire durer).
- Le bestiaire est assez peu fourni et, sans compter les rares boss, on se retrouve avec pas plus de 5 types d'ennemis différents pour les deux factions antagonistes.

Fixxer,0,23.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordhighfixxer/,"Problems With the Progression System
The current progression system in an otherwise great game is a turn-off and is going to drive would be players away from sticking with the game as it evolves over the course of its road map

Separate Cosmetic and Class Progression
Having a single currency, Requisitions, be required to progress these categories puts players in a position where they are going to make mistakes as they try to kit out their preferred Astartes Chapter. Players will be in search of the correct right shoulder insignia or company pauldron trim paint and this means sacrificing progression of class skills. There is no explanation of this risk to a new player and the system itself is so frustrating its easy to have level 15 in a class and not be able to afford even the first row of its perks.





The weapon system is convoluted and tying better weapons behind higher difficulty is a guaranteed way to drive players away out of frustration. The Minimal difficulty in this game is hard and recommending ""Level 5"" to players to take on the next difficulty tier is meaningless if they have spent their Requisitions on cosmetics instead of their class skills.





This game is going to draw a lot of attention when it fully launches. People will be excited about playing as a Space Marine. Even with the above suggested changes the game is going to be a GRIND to progress. When players find out their progress is also heavily skill gated in what is a seriously difficult game they will move on to the next thing. Its important to preserve the high difficulty for players who have the skill and want that challenge. its equally important that the perks and equipment necessary to play on higher difficulties become available to players of lower skill and that the systems involved here be retooled quickly or this game will end up with a very small player base of nothing but hardcore difficulty seekers. The entire backbone of what is otherwise a great game, its progression systems, are a total miss and I hope you take the above as constructive criticism to improve the game and sustain your audience while you still have the opportunity to do so.

FirePenguin,0,23.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fpenguin5349/,"At the moment the gameplay loop is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥
For melee:
- Chip damage is way to high with no tools of either preventing it, or replenishing health. (EDIT: A melee with ""fencing"" defence type has significantly reduced this problem)
- The idea of trying to keep getting armour as if it was replenishing health just isn't a sound one. The chances to replenish it are rare, but on top of that armour has such little HP and therefore what you regain is insignificant and often immediately lost.
- Parry is so odd. Not only have I found that holding the parry button delivers better results, but also a successful parry timing is done BEFORE the hit would land, unlike all other famous parry systems.
This is not an inherently bad idea, I think it's quite novel and interesting. Especially with the imagery of a parry that is prepared for being better than a parry that is ""just in time"". However this utterly ♥♥♥♥♥ the bed against small enemies in hordes. There is no predicting in a horde, there are attacks all the time and when you see an enemy wind up and you prepare to parry, that parry is highjacked by a random enemy that you weren't prepared for, turning your Perfect Parry into the ♥♥♥♥ parry. This leads to you getting STUNLOCKED which is a cardinal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sin in games like these. Absolute wank. (EDIT: This is completely removed by using a ""Fencing"" defence type weapon. Using one removes the ""just in time"" parry and makes all successful parries the same *actual* parry. Although this makes the game much much more playable and fun and removes the stunlocking, I kinda liked the preparing idea and would like to see it delegated to rare and boss heavy attacks).

Ranged:
- Guns feel like ♥♥♥♥♥ in terms of damage. A Rubric Marine cannot tank 20 Bolt rounds to the face unless the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is named.
- Ammo is rare as ♥♥♥♥ and because of the mentioned above, is absolutely useless as you burn right through it. I only don't feel this rarity when maining a melee class for obvious reasons.

Misc:
- What the everliving ♥♥♥♥ did they do to the Jump Pack in Operations? I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if I could fall out the map, just spawn me on top of a Player or NPC if that happens. There is no good reason to have neutered it so massively.
- also why is customisation just kind of poor? I guess more will come later but just in what I'm able to change, SM1 was superior. Why can't I change lens colour or thigh armour colour? And the fact there is only Mark X ♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Give me my gorgeous Mk 7 helmet and please don't make me pay £10 for it.
- The loading screens are abysmal and absurd. Sometimes it is faster to task manager the game out of existence than to sit through loading screens
- EDIT: the new fencing weapons feel kind of OP? I know it sounds like I'm complaining that one of my problems mentioned above is now fixed, but I can now just spam-parry my way out of minor-hordes. Not very engaging, stimulating or cognitive.

Fixes:
- Either reduce the damage Minor enemies deal in melee (one Tzeench minion should not take a whole bar off my shield), OR increase shield HP (shield HP is decent in Mini-boss events like Helbrutes so if HP is raised, so should Helbrute's damage by slightly), OR increase shield regen from specific enemy executions. Rubric marines should not give 1 shield with how much damage they deal, OR increase the health recovery after taking damage lifespan. It goes away far to fast to actually act upon.
- Have an more purposeful way to regain shield. I get nearly all of my Gun Strikes just unexpectedly, even though I'm always attempting to bash and stun enemies. Make bashing leading to a Gun Strike more consistent for minor enemies.
- You should not have to use the Prepare Parry mechanic for minor enemies. Not only does it play like ♥♥♥♥, they just aren't strong strong enough to put a Space Marine on the back foot.
- Buff the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Jump pack in Operations. It should go as far and be active as much as the campaign or PVP. ""Oh the slam, it would be too OP"" then nerf the slam damage dibshit.

I'm going to keep playing this game every now and then in hopes that the higher class level experience is better, but it can't be a good game if I have to slog through ♥♥♥♥ for 25 hours just to get it to play nice. Also I haven't tried PVP yet but I didn't come here to do that, I came to slaughter xenos and traitors and indulge in a rare substance called fun.",2024/9/14,en

Мы бьемся за Макрагг!
Простота, лаконичность, внимание к деталям и динамичный геймплей - все коротко и ясно, но сколько удовольствия от игры в это. Сюжетка была пройдена полным составом в коопе за пару вечеров под веселую нарезку тиранидов и обращения ""Брат"" друг к другу. Сама по себе сюжетка не является какой-то супер глубокой историей. Классическое (как в ваха коммьюнити любят это называть) болтер-порно с ""неожиданным"" поворотом, но изобилующее пафосом, духом боевого братства, эпичными стычками и красивыми локациями. Чувствуешь, что попал в небольшой рассказ по Мрачной вселенной далекого будущего. Порадовали различные отсылочки, в том числе к прошлой части и Болт Гану, и бэковые персонажи. Все то, чего мы так долго ждали от Вархаммера в геймдеве.
Операции по большей части интересные, некоторые механики приятно удивили. В целом проходились бодрее чем сюжетка из-за кастомизации и классовых особенностей.
ПВП чистый каеф. Easy to play, hard to master. Режим с динамичной точкой, прыгающей по карте, классическое удержание точек и командный дезматч. Весело, бодро, но ближний бой здесь работает на мой взгляд немного дисбалансно.

На выходе оптимизация подкачала: игра почему-то начинала подлагивать в одиночных операциях, но в коопе все игралось нормально. В пвп режиме тоже фпс был меньше, чем в других (добавьте сюда еще бесконечное закидывание шоковыми гранатами, эффекты от молота у штурмовика и ульту тактикала, которые в совокупности иногда делали этот режим неиграбельным). В сценах с обилием эффектов появлялись очевидные просадки, тут уже мои железки не вытягивали.
С последним патчем оптимизон улучшился и мультиплеер игрался без каких-либо проблем. НИ В КОЕМ СЛУЧАЕ НЕ СТАВЬТЕ ИГРУ НА HDD. Ну либо ставьте и тогда при каждом экране загрузки успеете заварить и выпить чай, сделать уборку и сходить в магазин.

Жду больше контента, новые классы и косметику на хаос. Ну и сизон пасс на Тёмных ангелов)))

Hikayesi çarpıcı, grafik sıkıntısı çekmedim ve grafikler gerçekten tatmin edici. En önemlisi horde mekaniği ile kendinizi tank gibi hissetmeniz çok güzel yansıtılmış. Benim için Space Marine oyununun bağlayıcı tek özelliği vardı o da gerçekten 3 metre boyunda bir Uzay Piyadesi gibi hissedebilmekti. Bastığın adım yeri titretecek, gariban insancıklar önünde diz çöküp sana lordum diyip imparatorun melekleri bilecekler. İşte bu oyunun zevki burada çıkıyor. Sinematik bir aksiyon ile sunumunu tamamlayan bu oyunda bize de tadını çıkara çıkara horde ayıklamak kalıyor. Müzikler güzel genel olarak, zaten grotesk müzik beğeniyorsanız bu oyunun arkaplanda tıngırdattığı müzik sizi gaza getirecektir. Sonuç olarak optimizasyonu ve sinematik performansı gerçekten çok güzel.

Oyunun göze batan en büyük kötü yanı maalesef hikayesinin bitmesi ve online PvE modlarının hikaye modundaki bölümlerden oluşması. Random generate PvE görevlerde devasa bir savaşçı olarak horde kesebilsek bu oyun bir 10 sene daha oynatır kendini.
Online kısmını biraz daha renklendirirlerse ve hikayeden bağımsız PvE modları gelirse bu oyun tadından yenmez ve yıllarca daha oynatır kendini.

Özetle hikaye modu için böbrek verilir. Ama benim gibi PvP moduna çok aşina olmayıp aramayanlardansanız online kısmı şuanlık tatmin etmez. Dev ekibi 2 yıllık plan açıkladı ve pve hakkında planları da var.

Karakter Customization kısmı çok aşırı ayrıntılı olmasa da size sürekli aynı şeyi yapıyor hissiyatını verdirmeyecek kadar tatminkar. Neden Salamanderstan bir assault yapıp koluna altın sarısı bant takmayayım ki?

Enis Kirazoğlu’nun önüne çıkan yeni 900 saat oynanmış oyun olup olamayacağı online modunu ne kadar geliştireceklerine bağlı malesef.

Tr şartlarında must have denemez bu oyuna. Paran yoksa indirim bekle, ama çok da bekleme. Önceki oyun kaç yıl geçmiş hala 50 dolara satılıyor. Ufak bir fırsat görürsen yapış. Paran var ve gerçekten hala burada yorum mu okuyorsun?",2024/9/20,tr

장점: 기합찬 우주 해병 아쎄이들과 함께 인류의 적을 때려 부수는 매우 단순하고 선형적인 구조지만 그것을 훌륭한 비쥬얼과, 호쾌한 타격감으로 사람에게 충분한 만족을 줌. 미학적으로도 아름다운 경관과, 웅장한 첨탑, 무너저가는 구조물, 몰려오는 적들을 보면 어느순간 전장 한복판에 배치된 인류의 수호자로서 포디 엠페러를 외치는 본인을 보게 될거임. 전투 자체를 굉장히 재미있게 잘 만듬

Sthalin,1,321.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sthalin/,"Лучшая игроизация вселенной Warhammer 40K !
Смело берите если любите вселенную или качественные шутеры от третьего лица.
Поставил бы 10/10 но максимализмом болеть не хочу да и идеального ничего нет так что поставлю 9/10.

В игре отличный геймплей, микс шутера от третьего лица с простеньким слешером позволяет доминировать на поле боя которое заполнено противниками на которых легко применить весь тот арсенал что игра вам выдаёт. (Игру можно в шутку назвать ""50 оттенков болтеров"") Сложность вполне хорошо отбалансирована но начиная с ветерана очень советую играть в коопе, хоть в соло я именно на этой сложности и бегал местами из-за тупости искуственого интеллекта напарников есть сегменты где приходится попотеть.

Контента в игре тонна, есть пафосная сюжетная компания с возможностью пройти её в коопе, отдельная кооп компания события которой проходят параллельно основной а сюжет обоих переплетён. Ну и кнечно-же весьма бодрый мультиплеер но вот его скорее всего будут подкручивать с новыми сезонами, те же хаосмарины особо не прокачиваются.

Атмосфера густейшая, каждый кадр так и просится на скриншот (Уже 50 скриншотов готово и ещё миллиард на подходе). Звук сочный, Болтеры бахают как нужно. В целом арт и саунд дизайны сделанны на высшем уровне.

Несмотря на некоторые проблемы на старте раннего доступа связанные с неткодом и серверами игры сам продукт крайне хорошо оптимизирован, даже на моей старушке 2060 игра на средних настройках держит 60 FPS при FULL HD (1080p) разрешении. Разумеется есть парочку мест где были серьёзные проседы но это сцены где буквально тысячи теранид воюют с гвардией в реалтайме.

Надеюсь хоть кому-то моё сумбурное мнение помогло с принятием решения по покупке данной игры.

Sokomol,1,10.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020348663/,"Space Marine 2, Velmi očekávaná hra mnoha hráčů. Tak co k tomu říct. K této hře jsem se dostal kvůli pozdnímu dodání Ultrawide podpory o nějaký čas později, ale všechen ten hype, co jsem kolem slyšel, jak je to vynikající a super hra, mě držel furt v naději, tak jsem čekal, až si to budu moci pořádně vychutnat.

Je to tak vynikající a nejlepší jak všichni říkají? NENÍ! Je to špatná hra? Taky rozhodně ne. Je to dobrá hra na jedno dohrání, která je sražená špatnými gameplay rozhodnutími vývojářů. Když nebudeme brát lore v potaz, poněvadž lore 40K moc nesleduju, skončil jsem u Fantasy, tak i já jsem si všiml pár divností. Ale to stranou.

Začněme pozitivy: Hra vypadá dobře, je skvěle optimalizovaná, pro některé typu ""čím větší tím lepší"" dokáže hra vyvolat wow efekt. Soundtrack, byť není nejlepší, tak se zde najde pár dobrých skladeb, které si chcete poslechnout několikrát za večer, Ozvučení a dabing.

A co zápory, které podle mě tu hru sráží? Špatné rozhodnutí typu ""Podrž tlačítko E půl sekundy, aby sis mohl kompletně doplnit munici."" Level Design, byť svět je pěknej, tak se často opakuje. Dojděte na bod A, zmáčkněte tlačítko, dojděte na bod B, braňte bod... A to jsou asi ty jediné 2 věci, které v této hře budete dělat.

Dále ovládání... hru jsem hrál na nejtěžší obtížnost a většina úmrtí byla způsobená právě proto, že Titus udělal něco, co jsem po něm nechtěl. Útočíte meele útokem na nepřátele? co kdyby se na to Titus vykašlal a začal útočit do prázdna, kde nikdo nestojí? Ve hře totiž ovládáte své útoky na blízko pohybovými klávesami, ne tak, že útočíte tam, kde se zrovna díváte.

A další věc. Hra nemá moc dobře vyřešený input. provádíte úskok a hned potom chcete provést parry? Well, máte smůlu, musíte počkat, až titus dokončí celou animaci a až potom stisknout tlačítko, neboť hra toto nezaregistruje. A takových momentů je ve hře spousty. Skočíte a chcete hodit granát? zase máte smůlu.
Hra hold neobsahuje ten ladný combat, jak to dělá třeba doom, kde doslova provádíte bojový balet a vše je v krásné harmonii.


Dále Titus, Space marine, nejlepší z nejlepších. Geneticky upravený jedinec... Tady si vývojáři řekli, že by nebylo špatné, kdyby střelba od boku byla totálně nepřesná a i na 20cm tak může váš náboj minout nepřítele o velikosti budovy. Ve hře si můžete i zamířit, abyste měli větší Přesnost, ale v tuto chvíli jste zpomalení a to v režimu, kde vás může nepřítel během 1 sekundy totálně rozsekat, opravdu nechcete. Nepomáhá ani fakt, že nepřátelé jsou se svou střelbou na oplátku na 100% přesní.

Bossové nejsou špatní, ale u nich jsem si všiml dalšího problému. Ve hře je dodge mechanika, kde když ji načasujete správně, tak můžete nepříteli utržit větší zranění, kdy mu střelíte pomocí scriptu do slabšího místa. Toto zní dobře na papíře, ale v provedení to zase není vyleštěný, poněvadž při tomto nejste na ten výstřel imunní vůči ostatním jevům, a tak vás zase během zhruba 1 sekundové animace může nepřítel seřezat.

AI nepřátel je OK, AI společníků... snaží se, ale někdy dělají divná rozhodnutí, jako když třeba místo toho, aby vás zvedli, tak si váš 3x oběhnout, podívají se na vás, začnou střílet a až pak začnou oživovat.

Příběh tu je, ale nic z čeho byste si sedli na zadek.

Hra jako takto je dobrá a rozhodně jí můžu doporučit všem, kteří rádi vypnou mozek a zmasakrují si hromadu nepřátel. Bohužel těchto pár nedokonalostí z ní nedělají tak vynikající hru, jak všichni říkají. Opravit tyto nedostatky, zrychlit combat a bude to výborná hra. Jsem zvědavej na další rozšíření. Když si někdy najdu kamarády, tak rozhodně zkusím i coop režim.

Za mě má hra kvalitních 7 z 10 a stojí za to si jí zahrát.",2024/9/28,cs

一緒に行動する仲間がなかなかに優秀で強いので、ノーマルならばよっぽど無茶をしなければ割とサクサク進められるかなと。
ただし無双シリーズと同じ感覚で突っ込むと割と簡単に死ぬのでパリィや回避、射撃と近接を適切に使い分けましょう。
ストーリーは屈強なブラザーたちによるブロマンス溢れる熱いものになっています。

大塚明夫氏が主人公を演じ、比較的万人が挑戦しやすいアクションとなっているので、これを機に日本でもWarhammerが広まるといいなと願っています。

マルチをぼちぼち進めています。
難易度普通までは比較的気軽にプレイできるものの、それを越えてくると一気に緊張感が増してきます。
現状ヘヴィとタクティカルがずば抜けて強いので、もうちょいバランス調整が入るといいですね。
また同じ難易度でもステージによって報酬は変わらないものの、明らかに後半のステージの方が難しいのでその辺も調整が入るといいなと。

Butcher Of Blaviken,1,80.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028329986/,"El 4 de septiembre, justo antes del acceso anticipado, empecé a tener miedo. El hype estaba tan por las nubes que temía que al momento de empezar a jugar, me supiera a poco. Y entonces llegó el día y pasó uno de esos momentos extra satisfactorios que pasan una vez cada 50 o 100 juegos. Cada minuto de hype, de machacar el botón de replay de los trailers en YouTube, de soñar despierto con la aventura que estaba por venir, se vio ampliamente satisfecho.

Estamos ante un shooter con cámara al hombro total y absolutamente tradicional. Algo criticado por algunos, pero que sin duda, somos mayoría quienes echábamos de menos éste tipo de juego. Sin complicaciones, sin medias tintas, directo a la acción pura y cruda, tal como planteó el Space Marine original hace 13 años. ¿Recordáis las sensaciones que despertaron entre los nacidos en los '80 cuando comenzaron a surgir los ahora llamados ""Boomer-Shooter""? FPS de la vieja escuela que te traían de vuelta los tiempos del Doom clásico, los primeros Wolfenstein o el mítico Quake. Podríamos decir que éste juego hace exactamente lo mismo pero con los Gears of War-like de sexta generación, aquellos maravillosos días de Xbox 360 y Playstation 3. Y tal como pasa con los Boomer-Shooter, lo hace trayendo lo mejor de aquellos tiempos fusionado con lo mejor del videojuego contemporáneo, siendo esto controles más pulidos y satisfactorios, apartado gráfico moderno (de infarto me atrevería a decir en éste caso), y explotando la tecnología moderna para entregar un apartado artístico digno de revisión.

Y es que en éste Space Marine 2, las carencias de un lado balancean con las virtudes del otro. A priori el gameplay puede antojarse soso y anticuado, pero te olvidas al momento cuando éste se desarolla con un control fluido y 100% accesible, y una ambientación que ya quisieran muchos juegos de licencia. Y es que éste es quizás su punto más fuerte, éste juego es sobre y ante todo, una carta de amor a Warhammer 40K. Si ya el título original de 2011, aún con las limitaciones técnicas de la época, conseguía entregarnos escenarios y situaciones dignas de éste universo Grim Dark, en Space Marine 2 éste aspecto se ve vitaminado y anabolizado a niveles de locura. Recorrer y luchar en las calles de ciudades colmena que hasta ahora solo habían sido representadas en artworks de Games Workshop o en escenografías para el juego de mesa de torneos tipo ""Apocalypse"", las llamadas escenografías de en sueño, que requieren de varias mesas y años de trabajo. O el las junglas que de un modo u otro de susurran al oído ""Katachan"". Si eres nuevo en el universo de Warhammer 40k, muy probablemente te despierte un genuino interés en saber más, pero si venías con cierto grado de conocimiento, o incluso fanatismo como es mi caso, vas a desear que el juego no termine nunca.

Y ésto se traduce en las propias mecánicas también. El ver una horda hormagauta que se extiende hasta el horizonte, pudiendo disparar y ver como hasta los individuos más lejanos caen ante el fuego de tus armas, y en cuestión de minutos verte rodeado por docenas, incluso cientos de tiránidos atacando al unísono, llegando, rebasando a la Guardia Imperial y siendo tu y tus compañeros Marines los únicos capaces de ponerle freno a esa horda, realmente te lleva sentir genuinamente aquello de ""Ellos serán mi bastión contra el terror, los defensores de la humanidad."" No han sido pocas las veces, siendo yo alguien que evita las osbrereacciones frente a la pantalla, que me he visto al borde de gritar ""Muere escoria, por el emperador"". O inclusive salir airoso de una situación peliaguda y recitar de forma totalmente orgánica y sin forzar un ""el emperador protege"".

Todas las armas son satisfactorias de usar, desde las tipo bólter, ya sean pistolas, rifles o ametralladoras pesadas, cada una en su estilo, ya sean de plasma o armas cuerpo a cuerpo. En ésta ocasión nos privan del hacha de energía, pero nos traen a cambio la espada de energía, la cual consigue ser mejor punto medio entre la espada sierra y el martillo.

Si hay algo que echaría en falta, y es algo que ya me pasaba en el primero, y sin embargo en éste aspecto, Space Marine de 2011 llegaba a hacerlo mejor, es algo más de personalización para los modos cooperativo y multijugador online. En el caso de los Marines leales, si bien han tratado de dar opciones bastante estandard, sigue estando muy centrado en el capítulo de los Ultramarines, cuando se trata de capítulos con una estética propia y distinguible, a lo sumo podremos arroparnos a un Ángel Oscuro o un Templario Negro, pero ya será más difícil conseguirlo con otros como serían la Guardia del Cuervo, los Lobos Espaciales o inclusive un capítulo tan querido como los Ángeles Sangrientos. En el caso de los Marines traidores, ésta es ya casi nula, limitándose a cambiar el color y la heráldica del armadura, teniendo cada clase una legión asignada. Si quieres un Marine de Asalto de los Devoradores de Mundos, tendrás que hacer de tripas corazón y hacerlo llevando las piezas de armadura de los Amos de la Noche, por poner un ejemplo. Sin embargo se habla de mejorar éste aspecto en el futuro, así que podemos mantener la fé, ya sabéis, ""el emperador provee"" :).

En definitiva es un juego que recomiendo al 40.000%, ya seas veterano de la franquicia, te hayas adentrado en la franquicia recientemente o seas un completo neófito sin idea alguna. Éste juego promete horas de diversión, más allá de la campaña.",2024/9/25,es

Honestly got no idea about the space marine story or lore, but i did play some warhammer games such as vermintide 1, and 2, darktide, and this one currently.

Graphics wise the game looks great, some details are more focused on than others, but it is really nice looking.
Not sure why they went with 3 players co-op and not the usual 4 player majority of people got used to, but maybe they have their reasons.

Game running buttery smooth, 4k max settings, native resolution, no upscaling, 65+ fps all the time. PC specs 14900k, 4090, 64gb ram.

one thing they may need to improve on, but this might be due to my region, is that i dont have any nearby servers to join to, and this affects people like me in Middle East, as the least ping we saw was 87 or 94 ping, never lower.



i recommend buying the base for now and upgrade later if you feel like it. 8/10.

RAVVSlathotep,0,83.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RAVVSlathotep/,"For all the improvements made to the core gameplay loop, a glaring issue can be found in the half-arsed implementation of the Operations mode. Unlike it was claimed by the devs, it does not have a solo play mode. It also doesn't have a proper way to ensure we are the hosts, forcing us to matchmake into an unstable pool of players with extremely long load times (we cannot kick them while they are loading), players who are either AFK or are playing dress up, or simply hanging lobbies that don't even load at all. This lack of control has, personally, forced me to leave several lobbies nearly every time I want to play a mission.

I cannot recommend the game while one of the features that offers it replayability is held back by such a poorly thought out matchmaking system. Allow for private lobbies and give us a server list, this has been solved for decades.",2024/9/6,en

Mav,0,9.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heresmav/,"Product received for free

I've finished the campaign and have a few more hours. I have some additional points I want to add while still maintaining my original points. I have friends to play with but a lot of the time I only have so much time or I just want to play alone. Steam having this in the single player category with the tag and, the promises of the devs to be able to progress solo caught my attention. Especially with this having a huge emphasis on co-op, that got me incredibly interested. That's the kind of basis I'd like to start with. Obviously these are just my points and opinions. Feel free to disagree

Bad Points are:

-SM2 has tried on every startup to install EOS. You can stop the installation if you'd like but I've read that it is tied and, essential to cross-platform play. It's an odd choice when most pc players (I think) will be on Steam based on the community consensus of Epic

-Data Collection is on and required by default. You cannot disagree to the prompt in game. Lord knows what kind of data is actually being collected, as I'm sure is defined somewhere in the fine print like usual. This is plainly unacceptable.

-Progression is tied to online services. I don't believe this applies to the campaign, I repeat this doesn't affect the campaign but, you won't be leveling up your classes while offline. I've seen a lot of people try to say based off of that, that this isn't a Live Service game. You will be wasting your time, you will not be progressing if you don't play online. Online services are a core part of this game. I absolutely hate Live Service games bc, one bad patch, one bad decision from the devs could potentially destroy the game and it's future. Helldivers 2 is a good example of being the biggest, best and fan favorite game of the year quickly turning into a very unenjoyable one. This Live Service model needs to go.

-Playing solo is not possible while maintaining your online status in the Operations Gamemode. You're forced into a server, and to play with others. The devs stated it would be possible to play alone and make progress but, to my knowledge it isn't possible at this time. So if you're short on time, like to play casually, or just want to play alone, it will not be possible.

-You cannot customize your Space Marine in the campaign or use classes. There are pre-applied skins that you can use with Titus in the campaign but to my knowledge the only skin I've seen, comes with the ultimate edition. Nor can you use classes in the campaign. The campaign will most likely be a sort of intro into the game and it's mechanics for most players and will be untouched after completion.

-There is really not a lot of content to play through right now. You will get bored very quickly grinding the same missions repeatedly. Do expect more content in the future but I would wait a few months.

-I personally do not care for the most of the classes, nor their abilities. I liked tactical and sniper but I cannot stand the equipment that you are limited to with some of the other classes. I didn't watch this game like a hawk as some did but, when I first picked it up, I didn't think the classes would be so neutered in what weapons they're able to equip. Especially after finishing the campaign, I felt extremely limited in my options.

-The performance in my experience isn't terrible but it's extremely inconsistent. My GPU and CPU will jumping all over the place. My FPS never got over 60-65 no matter what settings I tried. I have an good pc and even then, I don't like running my system too hard. I couldn't find a nice middle ground between performance and visuals. Definitely going to need some smoothing out.

-The melee combat is rough in my experience. The horrid key-binds make it worse but after remedying that, I found that hitting parry to the blue prompts, or dodging the red ones, half the time didn't register. There's always the possibility of human error here but it seems I am not the only one experiencing this.

-As for the editions, there's only one other than the base edition that I even consider. If you'd like to get the season pass as well as some of the skins, I would recommend the Gold Edition but, the Ultimate Edition (UE) is plainly disappointing. Especially since the skins are not universal. Ex. Titus's skin from the UE can't be used in Operations or PvP. The only class-based skin you get is, I believe, for the heavy class only and, that can't be used in the campaign. You get three other skins I think for certain weapons but again, they're not universal so I can't exactly say it's worth it. Just do not buy the UE. It simply isn't worth it. I bought the Ultimate Edition for a hefty discount from another store. I'd advise looking into that if you still want the UE but $100, heck even the $90 Gold edition just to play the game early, get the season pass and, a few skins is not enough to justify that price tag. Absolutely outrageous.

The Good Points are:

-The game's performance isn't great but I didn't experience crashes like a lot of others did. I have crashed maybe once. There were times when I thought a bunch of stuttering would lead to more crashes but they didn't. I'm reading that some people can't get past the first cut scene...

-The gunplay feels great. The variety between the guns not so much but the smooth reload animations and everything looks really good.

-The graphics are beautiful. The devs really knocked it out of the park.

-The Campaign's story although very short, is great. I am not very fluent in Warhammer lore so I can't say how it is lore wise but, I was happy with it.

I have much more criticisms of this game than I have praise but, this review will turn to positive when the devs smooth out the performance, rebalancing the classes is a must IMO as some are quite bad. then to deliver on promises of playing solo for us solo players and the casuals. This is a typical game where the devs say it'll have features and, performance etc. just not at launch... give us a few weeks and then it'll be the game you were promised. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide but I would wait a few weeks... even months then check back in.",2024/9/6,en

DaBounz,1,188.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016181539/,"Overpriced console game.

Combat is very cinematic and looks good, but gameplay is actually rather clunky and below average in quality (badly designed and implemented arkham knight mechanics).

Difficulties for the campaign are done the worse way possible : weaken the player character and increase enemy dmg an hp while keeping encounters exactly the same aside from that. This completely ruins the flow, which is already not too great to begin with. Players should always select normal difficulty if solo, especially since AI is an insult to intelligence and increase the frustration of the bad flow even further. Higher difficulties might be fun with a group of competent players (may be).

Campaign is 6-8h long, same for PVE...won't even mention PVP which has clearly been added to the game for reddit whiners who can't handle not having PVP in an RPG (play one game to see how hilariously bad it is though). So you get what...15-20h tops out of the game tops (unless you want to farm the same 6 PVE missions over and over again for skins...but why do that anyways?). For a base price of 60 bucks + 40 bucks season pass that you won't even want to farm, this is the definition of a VERY BAD investment. Check Steam store to see what you can get for a 100 bucks and cry.

Story is cool and fits well in the current 40k storyline developments though.

Money for the emperor !

Update : even though it lacks content, PVE missions (AKA Operations) are quite tasty. The different classes, with their respective gameplays and the progression systems are nice. There have been a bunch of gameplay balancing passes that have been done since release, some are good, some are bad. They address issues that are inherent to the core gameplay, and require a lot of work for the team, I hope they will eventually bring the game to an even better place, and that they will release a lot more content, because it has the potential to be really great.",2024/9/9,en

ПВП:
Оно едва ли не хуже всех предшественников: хуже ЕК, и уж точно хуже первого СМа. Не хочу много всякого расписывать, лишь упомяну что блок не делает ничего, кроме защиты от урона. Не отталкивания, не временного сиана противнику, вы можете быть в клинче весь матч.",2024/9/9,ru

I'm convinced the game is single handedly being held up by the fact that it's a 40k game alone. If it were any other franchise it would have tanked day one. The game was already in a state that desperately needed changes and buffs, but instead they just nerfed the players to ♥♥♥♥. The coherency feature is just godawful and makes absolutely no sense in this game. Your forced to either stay with your ranged team mates on melee classes, or stay with your melee team mates on ranged classes. Forget about splitting up to more efficiently complete objectives or to flank enemies. Most classes have perk options that are obsolete and never worth taking. The game was advertised as a hack and slash type horde game, but the game punishes you for using a hack and slash style. The enemies are all reactive to you, so any time you start swinging your melee weapon or shooting, they are interrupting you with attacks, which you then need to dodge or parry, and while you're being swarmed in melee, there are 10 ranged gaunts and 5 majoris with devourers peppering down your armour, which you won't get back if you aren't within 5 feet from one of your team mates now, and then every 100 meters you travel you have to deal with an extremis encounter of some sort on top of all of that. The whole game is like a souls game fight, except with additional enemies. You make one mistake, you're downed. I thought this was Space Marines, not Space Guardsmen. Only 17% of the player base has actually completed an operations mission on ruthless, but somehow the devs think the game was ""too easy""? Be wary of all the positive reviews that don't actually go into any detail about gameplay. Most of them are just fan boys who were going to give this game a positive review regardless just because it's a 40k game with decent graphics.",2024/10/23,en

If you enjoy 3rd person shooters with a lot of chunky effective combat then this is for you. If you enjoy having lots of customization to work with for your classes then this game is for you. If you enjoy working with friends to complete objectives and feel like a bad ass doing it, then this game is for you.

Now for some improvements they could implement down the line that would make the game an even better experience. There needs to be an option to run operations solo which I believe is coming in the form of private PVE lobbies. More importantly there needs to be a way to command your AI partners even if it's only to be able to have them target a specific target cause there is nothing more frustrating than trying to deal with a Zoanthrope flying in the air with your bolt pistol cause you took a melee class. Or if you are against that then give the melee classes the ability to perhaps grab the zoanthrope from the air and bring it to the ground to then smash with their melee weapons.

优点是场景挺好看，景深足够，建模细致，救路兹的那个地方是个血天使的圣堂，雕塑壁画都很漂亮，但是没有任何剧情延展，哪怕旁边有个数据板告诉你为什么这个普通的巢都世界会有个血天使圣堂也好，本身在背景里也有类似的情况，比如血天使曾经在某地战斗，战后在战场上为牺牲的战士修了个墓，甚至每年二连会派人守墓。见微知著，很多明明可以用上的素材，在游戏里就一笔带过，不得不说非常可惜。

Сюжет не измумительный, но подача материала блестящая и вписывается в атмосферу того самого темного мрачного будущего во вселенной вахи. Главный протагонист вызывает положительные эмоции (при чем, лично я с ним познакомился впервые, думаю для тех, кто проходил СМ1 эта встреча будет еще приятнее и впечатлит вас. Однакосопартийцы ГГ уже не так сильно заставляют вас переживать за их судьбу.

Геймплей однотипный, но атмосфера и графика возмещают недостаток.

В целом, после прохождения основной сюжетной части, игра вам предложит мультиплеер ПВЕ и ПВП режимы. Упор больше делался на ПВЕ, в связи с чем предусмотрена реиграбельность, развитие классов, уровней космопеха и оружия, составление билдов.

Depression Fortress 2,1,134,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TAKEOFFFLY-ONE/,"Это буквально лучшее, что случалось с Warhammer 40.000

Предисловие
Первая часть в год своего релиза (2011) показалась мне морально устаревшей: бесконечные серо-желтые коридоры, закликивание болванчиков, тривиальный сюжет и мужики-кирпичи в главных ролях. Игра не была ужасной, она была проходной.
В 2020 году то ли от ностальгии, то ли вдоволь нажравшись баттл-роялей с открытыми мирами, мне захотелось поиграть во что-то максимально линейное и простое и я вновь установил Space Marine. Каково было моё удивление, когда все эти незамысловатые коридоры и старомодные QTE вызвали во мне не желание прокашляться от слоя пыли, но наоборот подарили мне тот самый кайф от абсолютно простой и понятной всем идеи: беги, стреляй, превозмогай!

За моментом слабости следует жизнь, полная Ереси
Отчетливо осознавая нынешний игровой тренд на полуоткрытые лутогриндилки, которые интересно смотреть, но в которые совершенно не интересно играть, я стал с опаской ждать выхода Space Marine 2. Внутри мною уже было принято, что игра может получиться очередным новомодным дерьмом, которым с лопаты кормят игроков, и даже в какой-то момент я почти что полностью утратил интерес к Space Marine 2, но те приятные воспоминания о первой части в итоге продали мне часть вторую. И каково было моё удивление, когда я обнаружил, что это всё та же отполированная классика:

- коридорные уровни, в которых зверски весело устраивать ультранасилие, превращая в фаршмак абсолютно любую тварь на своём пути и не опасаясь, что в какой-то момент тебе придётся вызывать МЧС, чтобы выбраться с локации
- простые игровые механики: стреляешь в блок = урона нет; в тело = урон есть; в голову = МНОГО УРОНА. И никаких тебе вонючих циферок с шансами рикошета, классами брони и прочей унылой ультразадротской грязью для преждевременных импотентов
- никакой прокачки в кампании и ясная как летний день прокачка в кооперативе: больше уровень = имбовее перки
- ДО НЕПРИЛИЧИЯ огромные масштабы: игра действительно ощущается так, будто ты та самая маленькая моделька на поле боя из первого Dawn of War, которую отправили на суицидальную миссию с целью размотать вражеский опорник и всех кого увидишь на сдачу
- умопомрачительно красивая экипировка космодесантников, вид которой каждый раз приносят тебе настоящее эстетическое удовольствие (в первой части она вызывала если не хохот, то как минимум улыбку своей нелепостью)
- классные детали мира, а иногда даже целые сцены, работающие на атмосферу. Чего стоит один только дредноут из заключительной главы, в железяках которого харизмы больше, чем в некоторых современных играх взятых полностью

И весь этот праздник жизни посыпан приятным графонием с хорошим звуковым сопровождением. Конечно мне бы хотелось, чтобы однажды космодесантники, как им и полагает, заговорили низким объёмным голосом со стилизованным треском вокс передатчиков в стиле роликов FlashGitz, но так как Пётр Гланц, видимо, единственный оставшийся человек с работающим микрофоном в пост-санкционной России, подобного нам не слыхать еще лет 100. Нет, ну серьёзно, других актёров озвучки нет? Я ничего не имею против Гланца, но вы там ничего получше не смогли придумать, чем взять на не самую последнюю роль голос человека, который не озвучил разве что станции в метро? Если выбора нет, дайте Петру наконец денег или дайте ему палку , но заставьте его хоть на студии звукозаписи быть капитаном космодесантников, а не Петром Гланцом. К озвучке Тита вопросов нет, остальные не более чем статисты. Ну и внезапно ворвавшийся голос Шрека по воксу в кооперативе добавил изюминки.

Я не могу назвать это минусами, потому что часть из нижеописанного отмечена в дорожной карте и будет в будущем, но считаю важным обратить на это внимание:

- очень мало карт для PvP и все они полностью копируют друг-друга без каких-либо изменений во всех режимах
- мало уникальной внешки на оружие, а некоторые скины буквально отличаются между собой только высотой расположения печати чистоты
- на данный момент не завезли броню на хаоситов (грузовая баржа скверна-доставки застряла в варп штормах)
- пока только 6 PvE миссий
- поиск PvE лобби можно было сделать удобнее, иногда надоедает по три раза перезаходить из-за того, что твой мейн класс занят

内核其实还是僵尸世界大战那一套。

作为一名阿斯塔特，玩家移速低，血量低，近战伤害低（需要打连招不断硬直敌人不然会被反打），格挡收益低（想要收益高需要升级武器），护盾低，护盾回复时间长（被远程敌人蹭一下时间重新计算，基本上都是靠处决敌人回复护盾）远程武器子弹少，爆弹枪全系列刮痧一梭子打不死一个小精英，狙击枪升满级之前伤害也低，只有热熔枪才有些强度（6个职业只有3个拥有该类型武器）。

首发内容7个战役+6个行动模式+PVP模式

战役模式和行动模式分为四个难度，新手建议最低难度或者普通难度进行游玩。

7个战役（可邀请好友一同游玩）场面拉满，制作精良，时长5-8h。

PVP模式只有EAC反作弊，目前已被外挂占领，在整治环境之前不推荐游玩。

在玩家打完行动模式6个关卡，新鲜感过了之后，重点来了。

想要体验高难度则需要海量的时长来提升角色等级和武器等级否则毫无游戏体验。
角色升级的经验值与难度挂钩，低难度经验少，高难度没有高等级角色带的情况下低等级角色根本打不过。
武器经验最少二十多次重复刷才能拿到最高等级武器（每一把武器都需要这么刷），每种武器还需要大量材料进行升级（一关只能拾取获得一个材料，打boss可以额外获得一个）。
在通关了所有6个合作模式关卡看完剧情之后，为了快速提升玩家的等级以及武器，基本上都在逮着同一个关卡重复跑图刷，充满了枯燥乏味。（如果有人觉得重复刷同一关很有意思那我只能表示您说得对）

标准版即可体验所有游戏内容，豪华版只有皮肤的颜色和图案，（标准版也可以解锁换色和图案，只不过种类没有豪华版多），还需要自己肝代币来解锁（代币通过游玩可以获得，但是获得量很少），终极版的额外皮肤只有一个职业拥有。盔甲模型（注意是模型不是颜色）只需要打一定场次即可解锁，不需要购买dlc。

作为一名终极版怨种，我的建议是：如果有购买想法，建议购买标准版，体验一遍战役和合作模式的剧情即可（12-15h左右），普通玩家没必要硬肝角色等级。",2024/9/14,zh-cn

一定要稱讚一下後來幾次更新後忘記哪次，這款遊戲的 EAC 已經不會造成記憶體 standby list 快速增加導致快速且大量填充空閒記憶體，以致於可能填滿空閒記憶體的現象。離開遊戲程式也幾乎是馬上了，不像之前因為 EAC 還會卡一段時間。新遊戲刀劍神域碎夢邊境的 EAC 也不會這樣了，可能新的有解決吧。

舊的會出問題的 EAC 因為會在每次遊戲執行後沒多久，開始讀完整遊戲檔案導致 standby list 快速增加，記憶體較少的人或多開幾次空閒記憶體就會被填滿，較熱門的機戰傭兵VI跟艾爾登法環目前還是這樣。

standby list 記憶體區塊填滿空閒記憶體時會導致系統有奇妙問題。
遊戲上大概就是卡頓 stuttering 跟 input delay 增加，而且調整遊戲設定不會改善讓人以為最佳化不佳，因為是要用記憶體時受到影響。有些人可能感覺不到畢竟可能是偶而跳一下在允許範圍，但主要是流暢度會受到影響。
其他就有些程式會閃退、編譯時噴錯誤、圖像處理跳記憶體不足但使用中記憶體又沒用完全部記憶體等莫名現象，而且真需要用記憶體時反而會去用硬碟上的虛擬記憶體降低效能。
到現在 Windows 11 上也還是這樣，可能不是問題畢竟記憶體不用白不用，只是不知為啥填滿後有東西要用都不釋放一些出來。
反正沒事也千萬不要去清記憶體，平常使用要不關機很久才會慢慢填滿，可以清理的可能也只有這個。
有這情況可以下載 Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) 作者特別為這情況寫的 Intelligent Standby List Cleaner，設定好觸發條件就好，瞬間就會清好因為沒東西在用也不會造成系統中斷，也不用設得太積極。",2024/10/10,ko

Michael Obama,0,10,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991097170/,"I'm very conflicted about this game. I will continue to play and might change to a positive. But right now these are my thoughts. I have played through the single player on veteran. (which is basically hard difficulty).

Hopefully this helps people if they are struggling to enjoy the game. I know I was in the very first hours. Even now I cannot recommend at the current price even if I am enjoying it more.

In short, Space Marine 2 is effectively Darksiders crossed with Doom: Eternal, without the parts that made either of those games good.

The combat is... not particularly fun? It's very difficult to figure out how the game actually wants you to play it.

For example...

You will take damage. I think this is intended, but initally feels at odds with the fact you are a hulking tank of a space marine. That's werid, but okay I just don't understand the game perhaps.

Anyway, you can't avoid taking damage, so in order to not die, you have to perform executions/context specific moves to get back armour (which is basically health). This is very much like doom eternal where you get enemies into a stun like state and do an execution to get back ammo/health (even has the same flashing red thing around enemies)

But the problem, this play style is full of inconsistency. In Doom Eternal you can attack enemies while reliably know you can get ammo/health/whatever. In Space Marine 2, this is not possible. The gun shot thing might happen or it might not. Parries sometimes work, and feel like sometimes they don't. It can be hard to tell when an enemy will go into an execution state while you are attacking it and so predicting when you are about to get the next armour boon is hard.

This makes a lot of the combat is more random and about chance than anything, and the game is about managing your health in this regard.

So you think, okay, maybe I'm doing it wrong. I'll sit back and used ranged weapons instead of melee.

No.

Guns are piss weak.

As far as I can tell, they are designed to close the distance with enemies and open them up for melee. Some special/heavy weapon are designed to shred mobs, but even then some of those enemies can block all ranged damage lol.

Okay, I'll go back to closing the distance with guns, using melee combos and parrys to get armour and fight through the enemies that way. Maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥ at parrying?

Nah, because some of the early level design has ranged enemies that you can't get to... Those ranged sniper enemies can take upwards of 100 bullets to kill with some weapons. That is almost all of your ammo for one enemy?! How the ♥♥♥♥ does this game want you to play? I still have no idea after 9 hours.

Enemies also need to be taken out in order because other wise you will get utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Once you know this the game is exponentially more enjoyable. But when you don't...

For instance, the ranged dudes, you might think its fine to just keep dodging and killing the little mobs first. No, no, no. If you don't go for the ranged dudes with an almost suicidal vigor you will be absolutely creamed.

You will be dodging. A lot. Pretty much spamming the space bar.

Which brings me onto the controls for PC. They are utterly utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Change these as fast as you can.

I recommend making right click aim (you know like in every game known to man) instead of right click being melee.

Then make middle mouse button parry instead of C. C being parry is utterly deranged.

Then make F melee. Trust me, again, this makes the game exponentially better.

Anyway, it' s very weird game that I am forcing myself to try and like. I do not understand the reviews that say the combat is brilliant. I feel like I'm playing a different game.",2024/9/8,en

Геймплей незмысловатый, забодробительный и с чутка перемудрённым управлением. Не то чтобы он прям затягивает и даёт тактильные ощущения на кончиках пальцев, но и забросить игру желания тоже не вызывает.
Дизайн уровней можно было бы сделать и повеселее, для этого считаю что джетпак должен быть доступен постоянно (иногда хочется вертикальности на аренах, но летать дают не везде и дозированно).
Сюжет, да тут он и не нужен как бы. Но он есть, и если вы поклонник и готовы вникать, то может вам это даже будет интересно.

Par contre, Si vous pipez rien a w40k que vous savez pas reconnaitre un bolter d'un fusil laser désolé l'ami mais passe ton chemin. Le jeu est là pour plaire aux fans. Aucune explication n'est donné. Exemple si vous ne savez pas par avance qu'il faut tuer les porteurs synaptique pour tuer une horde de tyranide vous êtes déjà perdu. Donc vraiment ce jeu est fait pour ceux et celles qui aiment l'univers et sont fan w40k. Si vous êtes casu... Vous pouvez l'apprécier mais vous ne comprendrez pas.

Sur le reste et bien pour ma part sur ma 3070 aucun bug mis à part 1 crash une seule et unique fois face à trop d'adversaire. Sinon vraiment le jeu est nickel aucun soucis technique beaucoup de contenu. Le fait de devoir faire la campagne pour unlock les missions coop multi est pas plus mal. Ca nous donne vraiment l'impression que les missions coops en parallèle nous raccroche à l'histoire. Par contre bon dieu que c'est difficile ! En normal le jeu commence déjà à vous punir sévèrement lorsque vous ratez un contre alors dans les modes de difficulté plus dur ca doit être un véritable défi.

It’s important to note that this game is not Darktide and it is most definitely not Helldivers. For some reason that’s rhetoric that kept being parroted before release.

The combat itself feels incredible and is insanely fun. I thought it felt clunky at first , but once I understood the mechanics- it clicked. This really does feel like a true return to what gaming was in the 2006-2013 era and what I wish we saw more of today.

A tight , fun campaign and not too long with the ability to play through it in co-op. Co-op exclusive missions. Straight forward PvP with a progression system that unlocks cosmetics by playing the game and weapon skills unlocked by X number of victories.

Chaos definitely got shafted in the customization since all they can do is change colors while Loyalists can mix and match different armor sets. I hope to see them expand on that as the game grows.

It’s had a successful launch, even from early access. Can be played offline, performs well and have barely come across any bugs. As a long time Warhammer fan…this game is everything I’ve ever wanted. Now we just need a Sororitas video game to match…

Tarkus,0,301.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006052891/,"30th of October review update
The game is headed in a direction I don't like. Ruthless difficulty is just not enjoyable anymore. Your space marine gets a lot less armor than in lower difficulties, while enemies just become bullet sponges. Your health pool is gated at the bottom of it, so when you have a lot of it it goes down fast, once you have fewer health bars remaining it goes down slower. It's like most of your health is concentrated in the bottom part of it. Makes no sense.

Enemies do a lot more damage in the higher difficulties, so much so that it feels unfairly punishing.

Playing against chaos is still a bad experience overall compared to Tyranids. And I don't even feel like touching Lethal difficulty with the game in its current state.

Player numbers are also dwindling down, going as low as 22 thousands concurrently playing tonight. I think the game is already on the way to die, with less than 2 months since its release.

They should have used difficulty 3 enemies health and damage values across all difficulties, and just change the number and type of enemies based on difficulties, like Helldivers 2 does. They have the swarm engine which can show you hundreds of enemies on screen and they barely use its capabilities





All I'm going to say about this most recent update is that whoever developed and approved the cohesion cringe mechanic for the new Lethal difficulty needs to be fired.

Plus, this update as a whole makes me want to uninstall the game, after playing for almost 300 hours total and every single day since its release. Feels like Helldivers 2 all over again!

I'm getting PTSD just writing this




With the latest patch, the game is definitely heading in the right direction and feels much better to play. It’s a lot of fun, and I can now confidently recommend it. As long as future updates keep improving things and don't cause any setbacks, this is shaping up to be something really great, and it already is.

It's almost unbelievable in 2024 to see a development team that’s so competent, knows what they're doing, and can deliver a solid update for their game right from the get-go

The only downside after the latest update is the persistent stuttering, which wasn’t an issue before

The stuttering has been fixed with a hotfix




I've experienced my PC hard freezing twice - once after the prologue mission and another time while attempting to close the game, which forced me to restart my computer. However, since the latest hotfix, I haven't encountered any further issues like this.

For reference, I'm running an AMD Radeon RX 6800 and an i9-10900KF.


Matchmaking in operations is bugged; often, it simply doesn’t work. On top of that, difficulty level 4 operations are frustratingly hard, reminiscent of the problems that have plagued

Here are some specific issues I’ve noticed. These are strictly regarding PvE Operations mode, especially at the highest difficulty 4:


1. it's one of the main reasons the game feels so frustratingly difficult.

2a. : Timing a parry feels unreliable, although it gets better once you get more used to it.
2b: The shield block doesn’t block all blue attacks, which doesn’t make sense to me.

3. You're always scraping for ammo, which feels excessive.

4. Enemies feel like bullet sponges. It takes a lot of melee strikes and ranged shots to bring down medium and heavy enemies (not including bosses, which are mostly fine). Even small units, especially the Chaos ones with shields, are way too tanky.

5. Just 2-3 hits from medium or heavy enemies will bring you down. With the weaker classes you can die instantly even when at full health.
Your armor feels like paper, and you’re constantly running out of it.

6. Chaos is much more frustrating to fight than Tyranids, though Tyranids aren’t much better.

7. Some classes are much more effective than others, with the Assault class being one of the weakest.

8a. Difficulty 4 is necessary to unlock the highest tier weapons, so you're forced to play at that difficulty sooner or later.
8b. A lot of these issues would be solved if weapon progression wasn’t locked behind higher difficulties. Let the hardcore players push through difficulty 4 and above while allowing more casual players to enjoy the game on difficulty 2/3, even if unlocking weapon tiers takes longer.


As a result, a lot of players end up avoiding combat altogether and rushing straight for the final boss/encounter. But if you're avoiding combat in a game like what's the point?

The game desperately needs better balancing, and an FOV slider on top of that. One of Saber developers mentioned that it’s fine for players to feel overpowered in PvE, but not in PvP. Well, as it stands, we actually feel in operations. Even the campaign, on difficulty level 4 is easier, much more fun, and overall more enjoyable.

Speaking of the campaign - it’s one of the best I’ve ever played. So there's that, at least.",2024/9/10,en

lmsslkm,0,10.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lmsslkm/,"我非常不推荐各位战锤佬和普通玩家买这个游戏，先不说游戏性各类游戏启动问题和联机问题就搞得非常头疼。

先说说技术问题：
当前游戏时常7个小时，1个小时研究如何跳过epic（任务管理器结束Epic Online Service User Helper这个程序）3个小时匹配，3个小时研究如何跟队友联机结果无线加载根本玩都玩不了。。。跟好友玩甚至不如匹配已经绷不住了。

4-5个小时游玩的游戏性问题：
玩家过完初章就可以进行多人模式，玩家可以选择多人剧情（campaign）和作战（operations）。但是综合游玩了一下，游戏难度设计完全不合理。最低难度都玩的汗流浃背。角色远程和近战切换设计给我的感觉就是相互冲突战斗玩起来非常难受。

由于本人是比较喜欢狙击职业的，虽然狙击在清除高质量敌人，精英敌人和boss战斗输出极高，但是战斗设计核心就是鼓励玩家近战远程相互交替，导致我玩的狙击职业就完全没有类似近战职业的那种大aoe技能和清杂效率。枪械武器的载弹量也过低，早期开荒的低难度情况下面对高质量怪海火力和弹药根本不够支撑清理更别提怪海的刷新机制里面的高质量敌人都混在一堆一堆刷的杂兵里面。
（你要想狙击弹药循环加有能力清杂得几乎要把角色练满才行，因为答案都在狙击手天赋的激光狙击击杀回复弹药里。。。所以我得坐至少20小时牢才能爽玩是吧）

说到刷怪机制，你见过精英怪召唤的怪海里面还有精英怪的嘛？我是体会到了，刚打完一波子弹消耗殆尽结果在角落里面藏了个精英怪拉烟第一时间还没成功没打断又刷新一波杂兵+少量精英。我寻思这还是最低难度啊，弹药耗尽的我只能拿着那小砍刀一刀一刀砍，要是没请掉下一波又来了。。。你要不吧狙击职业删了吧大家全去玩近战算了。。。

关卡的话，目前就6张，但是每一张快的话半小时打完慢的话一把快1小时有点过长了，如果再碰上高难度配合失误翻车，想都不敢想。。。

总结：
因为游戏设计的缺陷导致我玩大部分地图第二次游玩的时候满脑子都是能润润不战斗爽通过跑图来降低刷潮概率以降低地图资源消耗，但问题又来了我得有至少能语音一起玩的队友啊，就现在这B联机我根本没法跟我朋友一起玩。。。",2024/9/6,zh-cn

UPDATE:

This game is my first ever Warhammer game apart from the actual board game itself and I've got to say. I absolutely love everything about it. Just killing so many creatures at the same time with a whole sword and stuff feels extremely satisfying and the gore makes it 100x better too.

The story itself is pretty short but the missions are quite long so you've got around over 8 hours of gameplay with the campaign alone.

다만 메인 캠페인과 PVE 캠페인 둘로 나뉘어서 타이투스로 플레이하는 메인 캠페인은 다소 짧은 편. PVE 캠페인을 합쳐야 그런대로 평균이다.

그래픽은 뛰어나고 연출도 괜찮고 가슴이 웅장해지는 부분도 있으나 역시 워해머 40000 설정을 모르는 사람들은 그냥... 오 괴물 많다 그러고 끝날 수 있긴함.

말하자면 다른 모든 워해머 40k 게임이 그러하듯 지네 세계 설정을 전혀 안 알려주기 때문에 모르는 사람이 보면 뭔 소리를 씨부리는건지 지금 일어난 일이 무슨 일인지 이해하기 어려운 부분이 있음.
특히 워프관련 설정이 좀 특이하다보니... 중간에 외부에 장거리 통신하는 장면이 있는데 스포를 적게 해서 말하자면 통신보안이 뚫린 상황이랑 왜 뚫렸는지에 대한 설명이 아예없어서 다른건 그래도 워해머 몰라도 멋있네하고 넘어갈 수 있지만 그 부분은 아예 이해 안 될 수 있다고 봄.

애초에 워해머 모르는 사람이 워프란 말 들으면 그냥 순간이동 생각하지 워프우주란 개념을 모를 텐데 이건 잠깐 설명하는 장면이 있었어야 하는거 아닌가...

결국 워해머 40k팬들만 만족하고 신규유입은 기대하기 어려운 부분이 있음.
하지만 또 워해머 40k팬이라면 만족스러울 만한 볼거리와 설정을 잘 살린 부분들이 있는 것도 사실임...


하지만 게임성은 솔직히 호불호가 갈릴 수 있는데
일단... 스페이스 마린의 육중함을 살리기 위해 모션들이 무겁고 둔탁하다. 이게 좀 답답한 면이 있을 수 있음.
특히 캠페인은 개떼와 싸워야 하는 일이 많은데 모션이 느리고 무겁게 나가서 다음 명령입력이 딜레이 될 때가 있음.
격겜같은거 하는 사람들은 이런걸 관리하고 모션캔슬하는게 익숙할 수 있지만 그보다 FPS류 많이 하던 사람들은 짜증날 수 있다고 봄.

그리고 커스터마이징은 존나 자유로운 척 하는데 자유롭지가 않음.
일단 코덱스 표준으로 스킨을 맞추기가 좀 어렵거나 몇몇 병과나 특성 관련은 데칼이 있지도 않음.
워해머 40k 팬 중에는 고증을 맞추려는 사람들이 좀 있을텐데 이게 안 될 수도 있음...
그나마 울트라마린이 주인공 챕터라 울트라마린으로 하면 괜찮은데 코덱스를 따르지 않는 병과 및 특성 구분 방식을 쓰는 챕터들은 고증을 아예 맞출 수 없는 챕터도 많음.

그리고 아머스킨과 아머컬러를 바꾸거나 하는게 구성이 상당히 불편하다. 자꾸 뒤로갔다 선택했다 뒤로갔다 선택했다를 반복해야함...
그리고 PVE랑 PVP랑 스킨설정 어차피 기능은 같은데 둘이 나눠놔서 둘이 따로해야 됨....
또 하나 아머나 컬러 설정 저장한거 왜 삭제하는 기능은 없는 거임??
게다가 멀티하다 메인 캠페인 오면 멀티에 설정해둔 아머 컬러가 전부 울트라마린으로 되돌아가는 버그가 있음. 다른 컬러로 저장해둔것도 울트라마린 컬러로 바뀌어서 저장당함.

PVP는 꽤 만들다 말았다고 느껴지는게...
일단 내 총전적을 보는 기능이 없음. 못 찾았나? 하지만 뭐... 배틀바지 돌아다닐 수 있는 공간도 얼마 없는데 못 가본 곳이 있을 수가 있나? 이건 대체 왜 없는거임?

게다가 게임에 들어갈 때 처음에 맵을 구경시켜주는 영상이 나오는데... 이걸 스킵 할 수가 없음. 내가 중간난입이 되었을지라도!
그래서 안에서 이미 겜은 돌아가고 있는데 난 맵구경하고 있어야 됨.
물론 이렇게 들어간 난입방은 50:150 이딴전적 찍고 있음. 당연하단듯이 우리팀이 50임

그리고 카오스는 그냥 제국스마처럼 자유로운 척도 안 함. 스킨이 걍 병과 고정이고 색깔이나 일부 데칼 정도 바꾸는게 가능한 수준. 이건 살짝 실망스럽다.
그래서 고증신경 안 쓴다면 사우전드 선 색깔 코른 버저커 같은것도 가능함.

끝으로
워해머 40k 팬으로서 캠페인 볼거리는 우수하지만
멀티플레이 게임으로서 게임성은 다소 허접하다...

워해머 40k 팬으로서 캠페인 점수는 9점
멀티플레이 게임의 게임성 점수는 6.5점 수준이라고 생각함.

따라서 워해머 40k에 죽고 못 산다면 스탠다드 구매 정도로 추천하지만 그게 아니라면 솔직히 C급겜 수준이라 비추

FatalNegative,0,15.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/m0rtar1on/,"Потраченных денег жаль. сложность в игре отстой. Игра должна называться КАЛгар

Основная претензия к игре в том, что на сложности хоть сколько-то высокой, ты не чувствуешь себя космодесантником. Это махина, которая разрывает всех руками, в этой игре просто игрушка для битья. Не дай бог ты решил подраться в мили бою против 2+ врагов или выйти в открытое поле против ренж-мобов - у тебя сразу почти фул столб здоровья будет снят. Игра как бы подразумевает, что ты будешь бороться с ордами врагов, но под это нет инструментов. В л4д можно отталкивать, в дарктайде отталкивать и стрейфиться, в дип кок быстро убегать. Здесь если тебя уже окружили или просто бегут за тобой, то у тебя нет опции, кроме как получить гарантированный урон. Убежать не получится, тебя даже в перекатах догоняют. Оттолкнуть нельзя, тут не такого. Заперить все тоже нельзя - фреймов для этого дела мало, а делей между новым перри и старым слишком большой. Замочить всю толпу можно, но пока ты будешь заряжать атаку, то тебе просто накидают за щеку. Ралли-эффект при этом не работает так, как должен работать. Получив урон, он постепенно спадает, но у тебя почти на всех пушках между ударами такая задержка, что восстановить то здоровье, которое ты потерял в толпе, не получится. Постоянно в борьбе с толпой ты будешь проседать. При этом можно сказать, что опцией противостоять этому является ренж-оружие, но это не так, так как оно все плохое, мало дамажит, замедляет тебя или вовсе не способно к крауд контролю.

Вместо игры за супер-мега танка, я как будто играю за задохлика, который улетает в лобби с 1 пропущенной тычки. Я не чувствую какой-то скорости или реакции спейсмарина, его силы и жизнеспособности. Скорее чувствую, что какого-то омеганчика облепили доспехом из папье-маше, пока все вокруг гоняют в титановых сплавах.

Под конец игры я уже морально устал, что увороты сделаны плохо, что у мобов под это анимации не заточены. Тот же дредноут хаоса имеет атаку, от которой нельзя убежать, но можно избежать уворотом, однако он сразу же за ней делает другую атаку, чтобы, как это назвали бы в дарк соулсах, поймать в перекате.

Еще задолбали любые ренж враги. 1 спрей любого автоматчика с выбитой броней - в лучше случае, вам оторвет полстолба. В худшем 90%

В общем, сюжетно - ок. Геймплейно на высокой сложности - бредятина, где высокий риск не награждается, а наоборот жестко паништся. Если кто-то искал интересный слешер, где будет интересный геймплей с челенджем - вы не туда попали. Вам в секиро, гоустранер и тд.

В самой игре очень красивые карты, декорации, максимальная детализация что позволяет человеку, который никогда не играл, не читал, не смотрел материалы по Вархаммеру 40к погрузиться в эту вселенную и кайфануть. В игре оч приятно играть на геймпаде, но на клавомыши у нас оч криво настроено управление, поэтому как начнется обучение сразу готовтесь менять управление по ходу игры. В милишном бою сначала все непонятно что да как, у нас есть несколько видов ударов с синим кружком которые надо парировать и тяжелые, от которых надо доджиться. Но есть еще один, совсем слабый, который никак не сигнализируется, вам нужно полностью сконцентрироваться на враге чтобы полностью его заблокировать и не получить урона и во время лютого замеса сделать такое не очень легко, учитывая сколько врагов на экране. В целом эта игра прямой продолжатель World War Z, он коридорный, с хорошей сюжетной кампаней, крутой кастомизацией вашего космодесантника для пве миссий и пвп и бой выглядит очень крававо и порой хочется кричать от эмоций когда рвешь очередного ксеноса на части.

Well, pre-ordered this game as fast as possible since I saw the gameplay... it was like love at first sight, never played read anything about the universe of Warhammer 40K and I knew this was the entry point for it, didn't disappoint at all.

Positives:

-Main story is very good, for a person that didn't played the first game I get to knew Titus and understand what he did back there and that it is still haunting him.
-I didn't knew the universe of warhammer 40k but got a pretty good taste of it because of this game and I want to know MORE!
-Character development, even tho the campaign is short the characters have a good development (will not talk about it because of spoiler), specially the other 2 brothers that fight along side you.
-You can play co-op in the main story and the other mode which is super interesting, you can play your story with your brother and enjoy the masterpiece that it is.
-The Swarm technique is insane, seeing all the hundreds of monsters around and around the map without taking a huge toll in your pc performance its incredible, it feels marvelous fighting hordes of horrendous heretics without burning your pc!
-SO MUCH TESTOSTERONE ! FOR THE EMPEROR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Negatives:

-Bots-AI they get stuck sometimes
-Some visual bugs in pieces of the armor while watching a semi-cutscene, kind of distracts you
-Super short main story, around 8/9 hours which is a bummer since it was going pretty well.
-Can't customize anything in the campaign basically, it is poor the characterization of Titus and his brothers, your basically only choose which weapon to start the mission...
-It had that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing, if your pre-ordered with gold edition you got 3 or 4 days in advance which is a petty move to do in this days... no I will not pay more 30 Euros for skins and 3 days of early access.

Kharos,1,146.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKharos/,"This is one of those times when I wish there was a middle ground between Recommended and Not Recommended. Aside from what are largely circumstantial issues, such as the Epic Games integration and performance problems that some people are having, neither of which I have personally had a problem with; there are things that this game does right, and things that it does worse than the first game. I don't normally write reviews, and especially ones that are longer than a few sentences, but I feel like I have to say at least a few things about every general aspect of the game here.

To start with the good sides:
- Story: It serves its predecessor well, it answers a lot of questions with some subtle references which I really liked, and is overall well written, especially when compared to some of the recent 40k lore.
- Visuals: The sense of scale is impressive, the fidelity is as you would expect from a AAA title, and the animation work is unique in the sense that it doesn't necessarily copy from either Space Marine or Astartes, but has its unique take on depicting space marines which is fluid and satisfying.
- Audio: It's not on the same level as Darktide, especially in the soundtrack, but it gets the job done quite well in a lot of places. There are a few disappointing sounds, like the heavy bolter, but it otherwise manages to feel atmospheric.

Now the bad or mediocre sides:
- Gameplay: It's so hit and miss. When you break it down on paper, it sounds good, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The ranged combat is okay; the weapons are a bit too inaccurate during longer bursts for being carried by the superhuman warriors that space marines are, and most of them feel the same, with a lot feeling like they're less powerful than their counterparts in the first game, or fulfilling a purpose that another weapon can fulfill better. It's the melee combat that is the main problem. You're better off playing it like Dark Souls and rolling around, both in PVE and PVE, because parry is simply too inconsistent. It doesn't matter if you perfectly time your parry if you are already playing an animation, like an attack, because you cannot cancel that animation. This problem gets worse when the attacks, even for the knife and chainsword, are much slower and clunkier than their counterparts in the first game. Additionally, in PVE, enemies can interrupt your attacks by hitting you, but you cannot interrupt theirs using the same method, which makes it not only feel unfair, but also weightless. The animation-pause does more to hurt the experience than help, as timing gets offset every time you hit something. Finally, melee in PVP can be cheated easily by just rolling, kind of like you can cheat the PVE by just rolling. Do not even try for parrying, it's a gamble. All of this makes the combat feel unfinished or badly designed, and I really hope this is addressed because it is currently my biggest pet peeve about the gameplay.
- Customisation: Nonexistent for Chaos, and practically nonexistent for space marines. With Chaos, each class is limited to a warband, so if you're playing a raptor for example, you will be a Night Lord. You can change colours, but you will still retain Night Lord model pieces, same goes for the other classes and warbands. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist for Chaos. For the Primaris, it is also very lackluster. There are less options than there were in the first game, and they're lacking in the variety department, especially when it comes to chapter-specific content. Also, please, for the love of the Emperor, give us back Space Marines. Not Primaris. Space Marines. Not everyone likes the Primaris designs, and I certainly don't. But I feel like this would fall on deaf ears, it's not like GW ever listens to what the community wants.

Overall, it's a decent game. It's hard to judge because there are parts that are very good, and then there's a couple parts that are really bad, and it's hard to dictate which one outweighs the other because they're largely dependent on what the user expects from the game.",2024/9/6,en

Recluse,1,31.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrantoftheisles/,"Writing a review for non-Warhammer fans, so if you're into Warhammer, I'll just say that this game will probably scratch whatever itch you've got. Go for it. The game was literally made for you.

If, however, you're not somebody who's into playing as a tacky-looking action figure, fighting against barely-legally-distinct xenomorphs, then I'd like to give an honest review after my short time with the game to help you get a bit more of an idea.

Ranged weapon variety? Forget it. You, at time of writing, basically have four major options - some form of 'bolter' (every gun that fires bullets is a bolter, I guess?) that are all more or less very same-feeling, a 'melta' (fire shotgun), some plasma weapons that all differ very slightly from one another, and then sniper rifles. They all get the job done, but none of them feel particularly satisfying. Animation-wise, a lot of the larger enemies don't react to shots whatsoever, so these weapons don't feel particularly 'punchy.' I'd give the actual shooting experience in the game something like a 4/10 - clunky controls, weird aiming system (which is justified by the hybrid ranged/melee control scheme, but that doesn't make it any less weird and clunky) and a lack of visual feedback often just makes you feel like your guns aren't doing much, even if they are.

Melee weapons? That's the good part of this game. Many melee weapons, all with unique combos to learn and enjoy, and individualized strengths even though they, theoretically, should all pretty much do the same thing. They cooked here. 9/10 melee system, very good. Lots of focus on countering and dodges, or knowing how to pull off combos without getting your health bar torn apart.

General aesthetics? Look, I get it, some people adore Warhammer and Space Marines, but like... they're ugly. Horribly ugly. Like something a middle schooler would draw in the back of a notebook while they're not paying attention in math class. To make things worse, the game has you earn cosmetics - perfectly fine on its own! - and the cosmetics will be... a laughably tiny change. ""Congratulations, your reward for completing 40 different 30 minute long missions is - we put a strip of paper on your pauldron!"" Again, I'm sure this is something meaningful for the crowd that happily throws away thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on figures of these guys, but for somebody who isn't all that into it... it's just a strip of paper with a seal. Not a very good reward. Your best aesthetic customization is going to be in colors, and there you have more room to work with, but at the heart of your look you'll always be the same, really ugly action figure.

TL:DR - if you have friends who are obsessed with Warhammer, this is a pretty decent game to play with them even if you have no interest in the setting. Puts Darktide to shame, but that's not exactly hard to do.",2024/9/10,en

Highway_Crossing_Frog?,1,196.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973470717/,"I'm not a Souls-like player and I usually gravitate towards the medium difficulty settings of a game. So when I tell you that I find this game highly satisfying for the challenge it provides, take that as you will.

There are 3 primary game modes:

1) Campaign. The campaign is fun, but rather short. The game itself is highly cinematic, so it feels HIGHLY cinematic in the best way. Recommended to play with friends, as the bots are fairly incompetent when you need them most (the most annoying enemies, the mini bosses, and the bosses). There is very little replayability here, as none of the unlocking or leveling mechanisms in the other parts of the game apply to the campaign and it's very linear. But there are some amazing moments that I will literally never forget, so I recommend playing it.

2) Operations. This is a PVE setting somewhat akin to L4D or Darktide that I find to be the meat and potatoes of the game. On the scale of a lifetime gamer who does not revel in the hardest games or bragging about how good I am at hard games, I found this game mode to be VERY challenging. Here more than anywhere else, you will be forced to play a certain way in order to thrive. That said, the feeling of accomplishment I get out of winning rounds at the highest difficulties is very good, and there are a ton of crunchy weapon leveling mechanisms and class perks to fine tune.

A recent patch was released with some amazing free content, but also with a significant difficulty spike that catered to a loud minority of players. More than a mere difficulty spike, it sought to increase difficulty by making the player less effective rather than making the enemy more dangerous (it did some of both to be fair). The result for me was that I almost quit the game. Fortunately, the devs listened to the community outcry and reversed many of the changes in record time. To me the game still has not fully been returned to its former state of perfect balance, but I'm optimistic for future patches. Class and weapon balance is severely lacking (only 2 classes have effective ranged defenses, making the other 4 classes highly ineffective against the Chaos faction, which is heavily focused on range attacks for example). Still, on the balance, all difficulties are beatable and this game mode is fun and rewarding. When I need to let off steam, there is little more satisfying than parrying, pummeling down, and executing a Tyranid warrior or Lictor.

3) PVP. I'm not a huge PVP guy but I've played a few hours of it. I found it rather simplistic. You will play as a space marine or chaos marine, at random. Strangely, the incredible depth of customization that is available to your space marines is NOT available to you if you happen to get assigned Chaos Marines. There is a separate leveling mechanic in PVP vs PVE, which felt dissatisfying to me when I gave it a try after 100 hours of PVE.

Overall, this is a great game with a lot of flaws, deeply satisfying and often frustrating. The devs really listen to the community, which, as long as they don't revert to catering to the self-titled ""hardcore"" minority, can only lead to more positive growth.

Maybe, if we're really really lucky, we'll even get to play as Terminators one day.",2024/10/21,en

L'action est brutale, rapide, et on se sent vraiment comme un Space Marine, écrasant les ennemis dans un déluge de violence. Les graphismes sont magnifiques, et l'ambiance sombre et oppressante de l'univers de Warhammer 40K est parfaitement retranscrite.

Les combats sont un vrai point fort : fluides et satisfaisants, avec une bonne variété d'armes et d'ennemis qui poussent à s’adapter constamment. L'histoire est bien ficelée et offre de grands moments d'adrénaline, le tout servi par une bande-son épique qui renforce l'immersion.

Côté négatif, il y a quelques moments où l'action peut devenir répétitive, notamment lors des vagues d'ennemis. De plus, certains aspects des commandes pourraient être mieux optimisés sur PC.

Malgré ces petits défauts, Space Marine 2 est un incontournable pour tout fan de Warhammer 40K ou de jeux d'action intense.

Como alguém que recentemente mergulhou nesse universo, os gráficos são impressionantes e direcionados a criar uma atmosfera caótica, tal qual é a vida de um Space Marine..

A campanha é curta, mas dentro do suficiente para a proposta do jogo. Com início, meio e fim, apresenta com bases memoráveis seus personagens. Seu PVE tem relação com a campanha e se destaca por ser bem desafiante em níveis maiores.

Já o PVP, ao menos no período em que joguei, foi um show a parte. Extremamente divertido e sem frescura. Todos os modos de jogo são bem feitos.

Talvez o único ponto negativo de desse jogo é a falta de uma trilha sonora que o tornasse ainda mais único em um mercado de padrões. Definitivamente, Space Marine 2 não está aqui para agradar as massas. Sua única proposta é ser divertido, e nesse quesito ele é altamente recomendável.

Conquistas/100%: Seu 100% não tem nada de complicado, a maior parte vai ser farm. Um destaque para a conquista ''Impiedoso'' que pode ser o grande empecilho para os completistas futuramente, com o tempo pode ser que se torne difícil fazer a sequência de abates no PVP sem morrer. A conquista ''Acabe com eles'' é recomendável que não marque os inimigos da campanha no modo operações (Há uma possibilidade de não contabilizar o inimigo no modo operações). Quanto a conquista de abater 41k de inimigos, existe um glitch na campanha bem fácil para se fazer essa quantidade em pouco tempo.

目前只玩了PVE，写了一点点小意见，希望大佬不要喷我。

我感觉游戏挺好的，可以给个推荐，但需要改进的地方太多了。


1.添加更多的难度等级，现在只有4个难度等级，我个人认为3级到4级的跨度太大了（也可能是我比较菜）在3级和4级之间可以添加一个等级。

2.加强玩家的所有武器（是的，就是所有）包括攻速，伤害等。
星际战士手上拿的是爆弹枪而不是BB枪，手上的是链锯剑而不是树枝。
目前除了热熔以外，几乎没有其他武器可以使用。
到处去问怎么打难4，得到的回应就只有热熔。

加强的具体方法：

爆弹枪应该加强伤害和添加些许范围伤害

(毕竟那是爆弹，口径放在那里，0.75英寸都差不多快20厘米了，能想象一个20毫米炮就这点伤害还没有范围？？？）

加强电浆/等离子枪的伤害和过热

我战术和特战的电浆/等离子枪是都解锁了的，电浆/等离子枪由于伤害和过热问题，现在我几乎看不到人用。
特别是特战的电浆/等离子枪太容易过热了，我不知道是不是我的问题，但我感觉开没几枪就过热了。

加强近战武器的攻速，伤害和击退

怪可以强，但能不能不要让一大堆怪冲脸的时候，把玩家挤在中间啊？
目前来说，我个人感觉就没有击退这个概念，被怪包围只能打滚，不断按下空格，使用无敌帧来逃走。
伤害也是，高难度下，打一个刀斧虫，砍半天才有点用，人家过来随便砍几下玩家就得倒地。
攻速方面，为什么这么多人吹匕首呢....还不就是因为都砍不死人，那就提升速度，反正伤害都大差不差。

3.腰射加强
就一句话，敢问这个腰射的准度是学隔壁的WOT吗？？？
打出来的子弹，和隔壁那个炮弹一样，能是歪的，离谱。


4.添加装备系统
比如手榴弹包，弹匣包，护身符等等


5.提升等级上限，引入PVE专属的加点系统
比如移动速度提升，后坐力下降，或者伤害提升等

6.添加更多职业
智库，药剂师等

7.希望未来可以有更多战役，比如扮演星界军或混沌。

8.未来添加大战场模式，添加随机地形系统，绝地潜兵2的模式真的很符合星际战士啊。

商品説明に嘘がある。

語弊があるかもしれないが自分はそう感じている
前作は未プレイだが、本作は発売前から情報をチェックしていてとても楽しみにしていた
Youtubeなどの紹介動画も沢山見ていたが、言うなればこのYoutuberも嘘の情報を垂れ流していた、とさえ言える

それは何か？本作は協力系シューターではないということだ
【3人協力プレイで〈帝国〉を守れ！】とsteamの紹介ページ内で本ゲームの売りである協力プレイについて
あるいは多様な兵科について紹介する文言が踊っている
Youtuberの動画などでも各兵科の紹介や、武器の進化、スキルアップでの成長要素、アーマーカスタマイズ
などの楽しそうな情報を発信していたが

そ　れ　ら　は　ス　ト　ー　リ　ー　モ　ー　ド　に　は　適　用　さ　れ　な　い

もう一度言うが適用されない
3人パーティーで出撃するストーリーモードは自分以外はNPCの固有キャラであり
協力プレイは存在しない
上記の武器の進化、スキルアップ、アーマーカスタマイズのどの要素も存在せず
ミッション中に使っていた武器がムービーシーンを挟んで別の武器を持たされていたり
特殊スキル（パワーアップやジャンプパック）などもストーリーの場面ごとに自動で割り振られる形になる
つまり、Warhammer40000の物語を一人で体験するだけのものであって
成長要素のある協力シューターでは断じてない。

ストーリーモードとは別の、オペレーションというゲームモードで
これらの要素を含んだ協力プレイを遊ぶことになる
ただこのオペレーションは、ストーリーの進行に伴って順次開放されていく感じのシステムになっていて
（オペレーション自体にストーリーのネタバレが含まれるため）
長い目で見れば特に問題ではないのだが
一番このゲームの嘘をクリティカルに食らう人は
HaloとかGearsのような協力プレイを期待して友達と一緒に買った人、であろう

ゲームの特徴として大々的に宣伝している主要要素が
一部ゲームモードにしか適用されない、というのは非常に不誠実だと感じる。

―――追記―――
まったり進めて10時間くらいでストーリーをクリアしたのだが
前作から繋がっているであろう登場人物や人間関係
主人公の過去などをプレイヤーが分かってる前提で作られている感じで、ゲーム内での説明はほぼない
なので、よく分からない。

ウルトラマリーンの総司令も、プレイヤーと旧知の仲っぽいんだけど
大事な作戦を遂行したいけど総司令と連絡が取れないどうしよーーとわちゃわちゃしてたらポッと現れてバシバシ敵をなぎ倒し始めて
「デカくて強い」以外の情報が与えられない
ウルトラマリーンの艦隊にいるドクロの面を被った雰囲気たっぷりでたぶん主要キャラの一人である教戒官も
ストーリーのラストで意味ありげにドクロの面を外すのだけど
主人公のタイタスは「あなただったのか・・・」みたいな反応をするも
プレイヤーはおそらく1mmも分からない。だって情報ゼロだもん

そんなこんなでクリア後は協力プレイ要素のある「オペレーションモード」を遊ぶことになるのだけど
正直、あまり・・・うーん・・・。

例えばHaloとかGearsは、長大なストーリーモードを満足感たっぷりに終わらせたあと
本作と同じような「敵とドンパチする行為を楽しむモード」が用意されていて
本当に、純粋に敵と戦ってワチャワチャしたい欲求を満たしてくれるものだった。

それは、戦うためだけに用意された専用のMAPだったり、分かりやすく整理されたエリアだったり
適切なタイミングで投入される敵の攻撃（Wave）だったりした

本作は、ストーリーの進行場面をそのまま一部切り取った形になっていて、細部は違えど
１．どこどこに行って
２．このタスクをこなして
３．最後にボスを倒す

という進行を、ストーリーと同じようなナビゲーションの指示に従いながら進めていって
その道中に敵がいるから倒す、という感じになっている

なので自分としては、純粋なドンパチの間に色々と不純物が入っているのを不満に感じてしまう
もっとこう、一つのエリアにドンと居座って次から次へと押し寄せる敵の大群を頭空っぽにしながらハンマーでなぎ倒していく
みたいな感じがよかった。

更に言えば、ステージをクリアすることで一律の経験値を得て、戦術スキルやカスタム装備などを獲得していくのだけど
「敵を倒した数やスペシャルキルを決めた回数、仲間を助けた回数」など諸々の要素が
経験値としてほぼ反映されないため（極僅かにある）
敵とワチャワチャするモードでありながら、敵を倒すことにあまり意味がない、スルーしてさっさとクリアした方が効率がいい
というなんともチグハグな感じになっている
特に、高レベルの人とマッチングするとそのことを分かってるためか道中の敵をスルーしてさっさと進んでしまう人が多い


まだ先行プレイ期間中なので、飽きたくない。
でもちょっと飽きそう
そんな感じ

- Už v EA hra jede bez sebemejších problémů, stutterů a pádů. (Zatím jsem hrál jenom solo kampaň, nedokážu říct jak je to s matchmakingem na COOP a tak dále)
- Mám 4090 a 13900k, takže nedokážu říct moc objektivně jak hra pojede na slabších sestavách, ale optimalizačně je podle mě Všechno v pořádku, jen je malinečko náročnější v hektičtějších situacích kdy se na obrazovce děje opravdu hodně věcí. (Malinko náročnějším myslím pády někam k 55 fps při nativním 2K a vymaxovaným nastavení.

- Pokud jste tedy fanoušek 40K... Neváhal bych.
Jediným mínusem a bodíkem dolů je možná množství obsahu při vydání, kdy tu máte 11ti hodinovou kampaň a pak 6 misí ze kterých vydupe každý jiný počet hodin, ale reálně bych to viděl na takových... 30 - 40h, než si odemknete všechno a začne to nudit.

键鼠党，游戏的按键设置可以说是相当不合理，在近战攻击、弹反、闪避、处决、射击、瞄准这几个主要战斗功能的前提下，键位几乎无论怎样设置都是反人类的（射击左键，瞄准右键还能换成别的？），哪怕它弄个一键切换近战远程模式，也不至于让哪吒上都不一定能操作过来。
其次在游戏性上，近战打击感几乎属于老滚5的水平，主打一个你打你的我打我的，面对一群杂鱼配一个武士虫，几乎没办法做到不怎么掉血的情况下合理的破局拆招；弹反没有任何反馈，不看固定动画我甚至不知道是成功了还是失败了。
远程仅玩了到爆弹枪系列，打条狗都要补枪，而武士虫免疫爆弹枪，幽默远程武器，只为近战标记后处决而存在。

Adhneim,0,188,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974226447/,"Hello,

En quelques mots...

Synthèse :
Le jeu est pas mal mais c'est à mon sens surtout un bon défouloir sous licence Warhammer.
Dans ce genre, il est bon, dynamique et impressionnant avec des scènes sanglantes, des combo sympa, du bon bourrinage, etc. Mais c'est à peu près tout. Et surtout, on en fait vite le tour et on le ressent.
Je précise que je donne mon avis sur le fond et non la forme qui reste jouissive et stylée.

NB : je changerais peut-être la note en fonction des mises à jour et ajouts possibles.

Pour en revenir à mon point de vue, le jeu me semble incomplet et sur-côté à l'heure où j'écris ces lignes (""warhammer 40K fan service bonjour"").
Le jeu est beau et à peu près stable (quelques bugs de début de jeu, on peut penser que cela ne va pas durer.
Exemples : plantage sans raison en cours de parties, certains modes de pvp qui tournent dans le vide (aucun lancement possible), temps de chargement affreusement longs, etc.




Elle est cousue de fil blanc voire insipide, donc à faire 1 fois. Ne serait-ce car elle introduit les classes et les opérations.
Si vous avez fait Space Marines 1er du nom, aucune surprise scénaristique.
Mais il n'est pas nécessaire d'avoir fait le 1er, l'actuelle histoire se suffit à elle-même.




Il s'agit de missions dites ""Opérations"" : elles se passent en parallèle de l'histoire principale.
Il y a 6 classes, avec leurs spécificités (et non, pas de construction de classe possible, j'en vois déjà espérer ^^).
> Chacune a aussi 1 capacité spéciale à activer.

Il est bon de préciser qu'une escouade (de 3 donc) ne peut compter plus d'une classe unique.
Une même classe ne peut pas être présente plus d'une fois : pas de doublon, pas plus mal ?
L'esprit de la coop' est sympa.

Côté environnements :

Pas d'environnement ""surprise"" ou dynamique.
Il s'agit d'une série de couloirs, ni plus, ni moins.
Saviez-vous qu'un Space Marines peut casser un mur d'un simple coup de pied mais ne peut pas passer à travers un buisson ou pousser un tas petits tonneaux ? ==> murs invisibles en pagaille ? Oui.

De même, vous n'avez pas le choix et le scénario est écrit d'avance.
Il n'y a qu'un seul objectif principal et les objectifs secondaires sont obligatoires puisque couloir, donc chacun est nécessaire au prochain. :D

Il y a 6 cartes pour le moment mais d'autres vont arriver. Je crains hélas que l'effet couloir soit conservé.

Il y a aussi plusieurs niveaux de difficulté (4 mais bientôt 5), c'est là que l'aspect coopération prend tout son sens au fur et à mesure de l'avancée.

Il y a évidemment un principe de niveaux avec un dédié au personnage, un autre dédié aux armes.
Mais les 2 fonctionnent de concert.

Pour les armes :


Comme non mentionné : il n'y a pas de système d'armure en tant que tel (exp : +% à la résistance à l'acide ? C'est non).

Pour le personnage :




Problème : pour avancer, il va falloir farmer. Et c'est un doux euphémisme.
> Tout d'abord car il faut beaucoup de certains éléments trouvables uniquement en pve mais caché dans des recoins de la carte (qu'on connaît déjà mais il faut quand même chercher car le petit bonus se cache :p) et sur les boss (donc plus ""facile"" quand la difficulté augmente, couloirs obligent).
> Il y a aussi une sorte de monnaie - utilisable d'ailleurs pour les skins (on y reviendra) - mais qui se fait beaucoup plus rapidement en pvp, au moins sur toute la première partie.

Et sans transition...




Il s'agit ni plus ni moins que d'un TPS très moyen avec les 6 classes et leur compétence unique (j'ai quelques titres en tête).
Pas d'armes à améliorer (!) ni de talents mais des niveaux de personnages afin de débloquer certaines armes (et skins) propres à la classe.
D'ailleurs, l'équilibrage paraît difficile tant le jeu est orienté coop à la base. Quoi que... ;)

Seulement quelques cartes pour le moment et de niveau assez inégal.
Il est déjà annoncé que d'autres feront leur apparition.

Enfin, le côté Spaces Marines vs. Spaces Marines du Chaos est sympathique.



La customisation du personnage est peut-être l'aspect le plus mis en avant (avec le côté sanglant / dynamique des combats).

Avec la monnaie du jeu évoquée, il n'est pas seulement possible d'améliorer ses armes mais... de débloquer couleurs et éléments décoratifs et de créer votre propre Spaces Marines (inventer le Chapitre le plus fou ! ^^).

Il y a quelques points à bien différencier :







Il y a déjà une ressemblance avec un certain Doom - pour les connaisseurs. ;)

Prenons en vrac :










Le jeu n'est pas mauvais mais il n'est pas aussi bon qu'annoncé.
La hype l'a fait monter en flèche à grands coups d'images bourrines et de customisation mais il ne s'agit que d'un nouveau défouloir.

Je ne le conseille pas en tant que tel car ses défaut sont à mon sens assez/trop gênants et qu'il me semble qu'il y a eu tromperie sur la marchandise.

L'effet couloir et le manque de diversité a été une réelle déception (pour moi).
Il n'était pas utile d'en faire des caisses mais là...
« C'est tout droit mes frères ! Tout droit ! »

Je reconnais que je vais encore y jouer pour le côté défouloir mais... Sans plus.

Comme précisé, j'attends aussi de voir la suite.",2024/9/18,fr
Epic Doom,1,9.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/epic_doom/,"A masterpiece that is so rare in today's gaming landscape - reminiscent of a time we called the ""golden age of gaming"" with absolute Warhammer 40K brutality that we all love.

Graphics
• Incredible model detail everywhere
• High fidelity and dense environments
• Loincloth physics is 👌
• World just looks amazingly beautiful - sheer scale 'shock and awe' at every horizon

Gameplay
• Simple but satisfying, much polished from Space Marine I
• Movement feels super satisfying and heavy as an Astartes should
• Gunplay is impactful and smooth, though aiming feels a bit clunky at times due to the way it's configured
• Melee is a transcendent experience, as the Emperor intended, with all the right splashes of red
• Old school gaming feel, this plays like a true Space Marine successor/sequel should


• Well-paced, Titus, Chairon, and Chadriel have some amazing moments in this campaign to save the Recidious System from annihilation by xenos and Choas scum alike
• Background characters like Major Sarkaana, Cpt. Sevastus Acheran and others aboard the battle barge were all memorable in their own rights - though many Ultramarines don the same Primaris power armour their dialogues and faces behind the suit intrigued me enough to warrant their own spin-off campaigns if possible
• World-building elements in the story campaign created a larger-than-life immersive experience, thanks to the attention-to-detail when designing the objects in the game - everything feels so authentic to the 41st millennium time period
• Epic, grand, dazzling - are all words that are too small to describe the awe I felt when finishing the campaign, it was a religious experience to say the least
• Too short, would have loved a longer campaign - easily finish-able in a day. Hopefully future expansions could be added that bring fourth more stories in this game/engine.

Overall, this was the successor to Space Marine that was worth waiting 13 years for - in fact there was a time when this game would not have been possible and to see it and play it is a blessing and a great privilege. For anyone who is a fan of the 40K universe I say this is a must buy - my only complaint is that it will leave you wanting more.",2024/9/16,en

Taddy Mason,1,86,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198104361263/,"I really like the game. I do wish the campaign offered more of a sense of progression and customization and rewards for completing missions in it other than just knowing you did so plus the accompanying achievement on whatever platform you might be playing the game. That aside, the first couple missions of the campaign I did were pretty fun and then I started doing Operations and never really felt a desire to go back to campaign.

In Operations, you get 6 different classes to play as and level up, with their own perks and 3 loadouts for each class to choose what weapons you want to bring into a mission. You'll be able to swap to any of those loadouts during various predetermined points in the mission and even if you don't want to change loadouts, you can at least use it to reload your ammo. Even if you fail an Operation, you get credit for each part of it you completed, and awarded some xp based on how far into it you got before you all died. If you win, obviously you get the normal amount awarded for completing that tier of difficulty and even more if you find a Gene Seed on the map during your run and whoever is carrying it doesn't die before the end of the Op. If you find a Gene Seed, be warned that you can't also carry a Guardian Relic-the item you can find on maps that can be used to revive yourself if you get downed. Scattered around the maps can be crates that can be smashed and often hold anything from ammo packs to med kits to the different types of grenades: shock, frag, krak (sticky), and melta bombs.

The xp you get for completing the Operation goes not just to your class of Space Marine, but your weapons used as well. Any class able to use the same weapons as another will benefit from that weapon xp and unlocks as well, meaning you can spend all your time with a chainsword on one class and switch to another at level 1, but still use the higher tier chainsword you unlocked with the higher level class. Once you level up a weapon, you get a Mastery Point to use to unlock a perk on the weapon. The more versions of that weapon you master, the more points you get to spend on perks that further upgrade any version of that weapon you use. Ranged weapons and melee weapons can each have at least 1 other version you can craft that works a little bit differently in combat once you unlock the 2nd tier of weapons. Melee weapons can often also have a different version that offers a block instead of a parry (at least judging by the description in game and how it's seemed to function so far). For example, I just got to the 3rd tier of weapons and made a force sword that hits nearly twice as hard as the one I was using before, but it's speed is at least 3 times slower according to the stats, and you can definitely feel it in combat. Even if it looks like there's only about a dozen or so different weapons in the game, you will be able to make a decent amount of different kinds that play quite differently from each other to keep the combat feeling fresh even beyond having 6 different classes and therefore 6 abilities to choose from.

I've mainly been playing the Bulwark class cause I liked the sword and shield combo it offered at first, but over time have really grown to love not only how powerful it's shield is (can block sniper fire-sure it staggers me, but i don't take any damage) but how good it's ability it. It can be upgraded to not only revive downed allies, but fully restore Contested Health of any allies within it's radius when used, plus deal damage over time to enemies within it's area of effect. Contested Health is HP you can recover if you deal damage within a short amount of time (or get a finisher) and it quickly fades over time, but again, the Bulwark can get a perk that slows that rate by 50%. There's currently no medic or dedicated healer class in the game, but the Bulwark is the next best thing for now and it's honestly not a bad substitute. My main gripe with it is there's a perk it can get that drops a shock grenade when it's armor pops, but that shock grenade also damages me when it drops. Not my allies-just me, it seems. I hope/assume it's a bug and not the intended design, because it can really get you into trouble at low health.

The Operations themselves are supposed to be unlocked alongside the main story as you play thru it, but I chose to just play my way thru the first 4 before I stopped and definitely not because I lost that one. Each one I played was not only pretty different from the others in terms of what was being done during the mission, but a decent 20-40 minutes in length depending on how things play out and how mean it wants to be to you. It can get pretty difficult at times, especially going from tier 2 to tier 3 in the levels of difficulty. I haven't tried the final tier/level of difficulty yet, but I can only imagine how much more difficult it gets. Just going to tier 2 ""average"" difficulty, there was a noticeable spike in how hard it was, plus how much less stuff there was and how much less the health kits restored-speaking of, you no longer dropped in with a free med kit from average difficulty on up. The higher difficulties are definitely more rewarding to play, though. Not just in terms of xp and extra coins, but how fun and brutally hard they can be and how satisfying it can be to survive waves and encounters in it.

The coins you get from completing Operations successfully and from playing pvp matches can be spent on unlocking new cosmetics for your Space Marines as well as new weapons for them to use to gain more mastery points for weapon perks. They're also used for unlocking perks on each of your 6 classes, so you'll probably be going thru a lot of them. Fortunately you can also get up to 75 coins per class if you complete each of their trials-they're little tutorials on how to better play as each class since each class plays so differently from each other.

I tried a couple matches of the pvp with a friend and while I thoroughly lost both of them-especially the first one-I had a lot of fun and want to play more of it. It feels kind of like third person Halo Reach multiplayer with more melee focused combat. You definitely have more of a chance to tank some shots than something like Call of Duty, but you and enemies aren't bullet sponges. It feels very fair in how they approached it as well. From what little I saw, it seems like you have your own progression system for pvp and you unlock more weapons to use in it. Even if you lose, you get xp based on what you do and if you do well, you're still rewarded for it. How do you ""do well"" things as simple as healing a teammate with the Bulwark's ability, assists, and of course kills, but also objectives, avenging allies-basically all the things that would get you those medals in Halo multiplayer would go towards giving you xp.

With only 6 Operations and 3 pvp modes, I was worried the game wouldn't have enough content to keep me interested for a while because I was expecting something more like their WWZ game where the main story missions basically were the main operations you did and then they had horde mode as another mode you could play-but I really think they structured things in such a way that it will offer a decent amount of replayability and keep enough people interested for long enough to feel like it was worth their money even if they decide to not finish the main campaign.

That said, I think starting things off with a forced campaign tutorial and then wanting you to play the first campaign mission before unlocking the first Operation was a bad decision. They should have dumped you straight onto the battle barge and let you at least do the first Operation and saved the whole forced tutorial and ""play a mission to unlock an Operation"" mechanic for after your first Operation rather than doing it the other way around. ---

PonyKnight,1,36.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PonyKnight/,"Сразу скажу, что считаю первую часть очень переоценённой, так-как это была просто ок экшн игра по WH40K, но франчайзу везло только на стратегии, поэтому даже такому фанаты были безумно рады. К сожалению даже среди стратегий у серии начались проблемы и DOW3 была полным провалом. В прошлом году вышла замечательная Warhammer 40000: Rogue Trader, от русской студии Owlcat Games, первая за долгое время игра по франшизе, которая была сразу хорошая и первая широко известная хорошая РПГ по франшизе. В этом году другая русская студия (ну или какая она сейчас на бумагах) выпустила Space Marine 2, игру которая сразу вышла без особых косяков и в принципе одна из лучших игр года.


Главная проблема первой части была в однообразии всего, хоть и с проблесками красивой архитектуры храмов и прочего. Вторая часть полностью исправляет эту проблему давая уровни на трёх разных планетах с очень детальным окружением. Если на первой планете мы видим в основном инопланетные джунгли, то уже на второй и третьей нас водят по городу, храмам и местам захоронений. Даже главный хаб невероятно детальный и меняется между миссиями. В мультиплеере, как и в первой части, мы можем открывать новые части брони и сделать из своего персонажа копию любимой фигурки. Врагов тоже разнообразили, как и в первой части, это всё ещё 2 фракции, но с гораздо большим разнообразием классов врагов. В игре всё сделано детально и красиво. Вот реально к визуалу не придраться, разработчики явно много над ним работали и явно с большой любовью.


Сюжетка средней длинны, я думаю, что в районе 10+ часов. Плюс ещё несколько кооперативных сайд заданий (операций). Всю игру можно пройти в одиночку и в коопе. Даже на самой высокой сложности, боты бывают полезны. Они будут убивать врагов, если вас нужно оживить, то это будет их приоритетом и они не умирают до конца. Хотелось бы иметь возможность скомандовать им атаковать приоритетную цель, но это мелочи. Кооперативные миссии в принципе то же самое, что и сюжетка по строению уровней, но с несколькими новыми механиками и классами (у каждого свой главный скилл и набор оружия). Только один представитель класса может быть в команде одновременно, что в принципе может стать проблемой, но об этом позже. ПВП режим тоже использует отдельные классы с отдельной бронёй и прочим. В общем контента в игре много и на разный вкус. В будущем нам обещают новое оружие, скины, карты и годы поддержки. Учитывая то, как игра выстрелила, за это можно не беспокоиться, но даже просто сюжетка и кооп стоят своих денег.


Геймплейно, боевая система достаточно простая и в принципе работает. Оружие ближнего и дальнего боя одинаково важно. Во многих подобных игра, сильных врагов имеет смысл убивать только ближнем боем, но в SM2, частенько нужно использовать огнестрел и гранаты, особенно против врагов с дальними атаками. По большей части, мы уворачиваемся и парируем атаки, добивания с анимациями нужны для восполнения брони, поэтому добивать придётся часто и анимаций этого маловато, но в принципе сильной проблемой это не становится. В коопе у классов есть деревья прокачки, поэтому любителям гринда будет чем заняться помимо открытия брони и цветов. В целом, как я уже сказал, геймплей работает и он норм, не новое слово в жанре, но и не унылый.


Я считаю, что у игры есть некоторые проблемы с балансом на самой высокой сложности, самые слабые враги с дальними атаками, уж слишком много наносят урона и очень часто. Зоантропы вообще сильнейшие противники в игре, которые слишком уж хороши во всём. Но это в принципе не большие проблемы, большой я считаю обилие загрузок. Что бы перейти вообще в любой режим игры, ты в начале должен загрузиться в хаб из которого уже ты по терминалу выбираешь, во что играть. Хаб, конечно очень красивый, но вот на 25ом часу я очень сильно хочу возможность делать это всё из главного меню. Так же нельзя нормально настроить, хочешь ты подключиться к уже начатой кооп игре или нет, ты подключаешься к команде и только после этого видишь какие у них классы, и в результате может начаться ожидание того, что бы кто-то сменил класс. Я очень надеюсь что в будущем это поправят. Вторая проблема это то, что даже в одиночной игре ты всегда подключён к серверам и если во время одиночной компании с ботами у тебя обрубился интернет, то игра предлагает тебе играть оффлайн, но перебрасывает тебя к последней контрольной точке, что сильно раздражает.


Фанаты WH40K уже второй год подряд очень хорошо едят. Не просто хорошая игра, а одна из лучших в этом году и вообще одна из лучших по франшизе. При правильной поддержке, она ещё многие годы будет жить с большим количеством игроков. Один из редких случаев, когда разработчики попытались сделать кучу всего и у них получилось. Конечно хотелось бы иметь внутриигровую вики для новичков, так-как в тебя БУДУТ бросаться непонятными словами, но это мелочи. Я надеюсь, что в будущем в главное меню добавят возможность выбирать режимы игры и прочее, а в остальном, мрачное будущее игры выглядит очень многообещающим.",2024/9/14,ru

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, uzun süredir beklenen ve ilk oyunun hayranlarının sabırsızlıkla takip ettiği bir devam oyunu. İlk oyundaki aksiyon dolu ve yoğun savaş atmosferi bu oyunda da aynen devam ediyor, ancak bu sefer yeni mekanikler, gelişmiş grafikler ve daha derin bir hikaye ile karşımıza çıkıyor.

Grafik ve Atmosfer
Space Marine 2, görsel olarak oldukça etkileyici. Oyun, Warhammer 40K evreninin karanlık ve gotik estetiğini başarıyla yansıtıyor. Detaylı çevre tasarımı, devasa savaş alanları ve Tyranid’lerin ürpertici tasarımları ile oyunun atmosferi inanılmaz derecede yoğun. Daha önce ""World War Z"" oyununda da kullanılan ""Swarm Engine"" sayesinde, karakter animasyonları ve patlamalar gerçekçi ve etkileyici görünüyor. Özellikle bolca kullanılan kan ve parçalanma efektleri, Space Marine 2'yi tam anlamıyla bir görsel şölen haline getiriyor.

Oynanış
Oynanış açısından, Space Marine 2 ilk oyunun aksiyon dolu tarzını koruyor. Yine bir Space Marine olarak Tyranid'lere karşı destansı savaşlara giriyorsunuz. Yakın dövüş silahları, ağır makineli tüfekler ve plazma silahları gibi ikonik Warhammer silahlarını kullanmak, savaş sahnelerini daha da heyecanlı hale getiriyor. Yüksek tempolu, kanlı savaşlar ilk oyunun ruhunu canlı tutuyor. Ancak yeni eklenen kombolar ve daha akıcı kontrol mekanikleri sayesinde dövüşler çok daha akıcı ve keyifli bir hal almış.

Düşman çeşitliliği de oldukça etkileyici. Tyranid’lerin farklı türleri, her biri farklı taktikler gerektiren çeşitli savaş senaryoları sunuyor. Devasa boss savaşları ise oyuna epik bir his katıyor.

Hikaye ve Atmosfer
Warhammer 40K evreninin derinliği, oyunun hikayesine de yansımış durumda. Hikaye, baş karakterimiz Titus'un etrafında şekilleniyor ve onu, Tyranid istilasına karşı savaşırken görüyoruz. Oyunun atmosferi, gotik bilimkurgu ve kaosun birleşimiyle oldukça kasvetli ve yoğun bir his veriyor. Özellikle Warhammer evrenine hakim olan oyuncular için bu atmosfer büyük bir artı olacak.

Çoklu Oyuncu Modu
İlk oyunda olduğu gibi çok oyunculu mod, Space Marine 2'nin en heyecan verici yanlarından biri. Arkadaşlarınızla birlikte devasa Tyranid sürülerine karşı hayatta kalma mücadelesi vermek oldukça tatmin edici ve eğlenceli. Ayrıca kooperatif modunda ekipman ve karakter özelleştirmeleri de oyunun çok oyunculu kısmını çeşitlendiriyor. PVP'si de ayrı bir keyifli. Özellikle COD gibi fast-pace oyunlardan sıkıldıysanız, düşük temposu, yavaş movementı ve takım bazlı çatışmalar size ilaç gibi gelecektir.

Sonuç
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, ilk oyunun hayranlarını memnun edecek şekilde tasarlanmış ve yeni nesil teknolojilerle güçlendirilmiş bir devam oyunu. Yüksek tempolu aksiyon, görsel şölen sunan savaş sahneleri ve Warhammer 40K evreninin karanlık atmosferi, oyunu başarılı bir deneyim haline getiriyor. Warhammer 40K evrenine aşina olmayanlar için bile, yoğun savaş mekanikleri ve etkileyici görsellerle dolu bir aksiyon oyunu olarak dikkat çekiyor.

Eğer aksiyon dolu bir üçüncü şahıs nişancı oyunu arıyorsanız ve Warhammer evreninin fanıysanız, ""Space Marine 2"" tam size göre olabilir.",2024/9/14,tr

Warum?
1. Die Bots sind nur Statisten. Sie machen kein Dmg, kein Finishmove, nutzen keine Fähigkeiten und stehen nur dumm rum. Sämtliche Spielmechaniken muss man selbst übernehmen (zb. Absorber mit Flammenwerfer fernhalten und parallel mehrere größere Gegner killen) und nebenbei noch den ganzen Schaden. Kein Thema wäre Punkt 2 nicht.
2. Die Gegner fokussieren ausschließlich dich und rennen selbst an deinem Team vorbei (wenn du mit Bots spielst)
3. Die Fernkampfwaffen, trotz ihrer Größe, machen kaum Schaden.
4. Fähigkeiten wie Parieren/Blocken werden oft nicht ausgeführt.
5. Selbst ein Space Marine hindern als kleinste Gegenstände auf dem Boden wie ein Ast, eine Ausweichrolle durchzuführen
6. Nach der Kampagne gibt es 6 Missionen die man immer wieder grinten kann für Cosmetics und Skillpunkte, um die selben Missionen auf höhere Schwierigkeitsgrad erneut zu grinten.

Cisco [LF],0,56.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/szyks/,"Lore wize its a great 40K game and it was beutifully executed in visuals and stability, good microtransactions policy and great content yet to be released.

However, i dont feel like a space marine when i play it anymore. The weapons don't feel impactfull, melee feels like a gentle massage on most of the enemies and a smal group of the weakest ones is capable of taking you down very fast and easilly.

Moreover, Saber Interactive, repeating the same mistakes of Arrowhead on the Nerfdivers fiasco, listened to the sweaty try hard minority of the comunity, and just released an update bumping up even more the dificulty across the board, Making you feel more like a guardsman than an Astates.

Not the game i bought, not the power fantasy i wanted to play anymore.

UPDATE:
Recently i received an answer from the developer:
----------
Brother Numitor [developer]  @ 7:02pm
Hello Cisco,

Thank you for the comments on the game. The feedback from our battle brothers is always welcome, and used for future updates of the game, and this time it'll be no different.

Also, I'm glad to inform that patch 4.1 fixed the balancing of the weapons in the game.

Please keep the comments coming, brother!

The Emperor Protects.

After this answer, I went back into the game, played one mission with each class, played the new mission and tested the new gun. My impression was that nothing about the game feel had changed.

Initially this is a good, fun game but the higher difficulties were incredibly difficult which made me simply not want to bother playing anymore. Matchmaking didn't seem to work most of the time and the bots literally did nothing and armor would only protect a single hit except from the most damaging attacks which could take more.

Patch 3.0 changed the armor to work like you would expect, an extended health bar, and vastly improved the bots and made them actually do something. The game was suddenly way easier on the highest difficulties and you could actually progress. Honestly bots were usually better than the players I got matched with.

CaHkTyM,1,178.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198198450890/,"Пишу отзыв в поддержку игры, чтобы хотя бы немного затмить большое количество ереси, которое полилось на эту игру от залётных еретиков, поскольку когда я увидел вчера смешанные отзывы, то нехило прифигел.
В основном негативные отзывы разделились на 2 вида: отсутствие поддержки широкоформатных мониторов и вылеты, идущие в комплекте с плохой оптимизацией, то есть видимо претензий к геймлею ни у кого нет, шикарно, всех всё устраивает, я рад.

1. Претензия по поводу поддержки широкоформатных мониторов это не только ересь, но и полнейшее отсутствие желания изучить информацию, а по итогу даже не выяснить, что разработчики заранее предупредили о том, что эта самая поддержка будет добавлена в этом же месяце, поэтому ты либо сиди, терпи и жди, либо не покупай игру, пока её не добавят, а то по бреду разнылись тут некоторые.

2. Далее идём к непонятным мне и многим другим людям проблемам с оптимизацией и вылетам. Когда я читаю отзывы о том, что у людей с 30 и 40 серией видеокарт вылетает и фризит игра, то я выпадаю с этого. Кто эти люди? Откуда они берутся?
Затем я читаю положительные отзывы, люди с 20, 30 и 40 серией видеокарт спокойно играют в игру и не жалуются, причём процессоры не сильно отличаются от тех, кто пишет негативные отзывы, поэтому многие также удивляются тем, кто встречает проблемы с оптимизацией. А некоторые, судя по отзывам, умудряются спокойно играть на сериях GTX. И я понимаю, что мне глупо что-то говорить с моей 4090 и i9-13900K, поскольку у меня с DLSS на качестве выдаёт спокойные 110-125 фпс в 4K на ультрах, а без него 70-80, но когда я увидел претензии к оптимизации, то мне стало плохо.
И то ли дело в индивидуальной конфигурации ПК, то ли люди просто не знают, что такое FSR и DLSS, то ли это действительно какие-то еретики и приверженцы Хаоса, но возможно, что это просто совокупность всего и сразу.

В плане геймплея игра то что надо, заруба, мясо, кровь, чисто побегать и поразносить местных оригинальных зергов от третьего лица. Сюжетная кампания по времени прохождения и наполненности примерно такая же как и в первой части, по сути просто есть, но она также достаточно хороша. Подвезли нормальную русскую озвучку, всё как и обещали, приятно. Длительный PVE режим, а точнее операции с прокачкой для задротов, имеется, это я люблю. PVP режим для меня просто есть, я уже давно это разлюбил, но пускай будет, играть в него не заставляют. Если есть друзья, то кайф, с ними и сюжет интереснее проходить, и PVE контент осваивать веселее.
Сам я не сказать, что являюсь огромным фанатом этой вселенной и нереальным лороведом, просто любитель и обыватель, что-то знаю, что-то нет, и я просто могу лишь порекомендовать эту игру, поскольку, насколько я знаю, хорошие игры по вахе выходят достаточно редко, и эта одна из них.",2024/9/6,ru

SM2 is kinda like Gears of War or God of War I guess. Its core gameplay is fun but unfortunately very shallow and repetitive. It lacks any meaningful RPG mechanics. The story is short, not replayable, and you can't significantly customize your main hero. The squad mates are also not customizable, and are dumb as bricks. I did almost finish the campaign and it was alright, mid at best.


I also just put a few hours into the main ""meat"" of the game, which are the coop Operations. And yeah, I simply don't see myself continuing to play this. The levels are super linear, but movements is so slow and in combat you're stuck inside animations for half the time. Combat = parry simulator, and honestly the Batman games did this much better. Clearly the game was meant for console peasan...I mean players, and ported over to PC. It worked for them, the game sold a lot. But MKB feels terrible. The progression seems fine, but the loop is just not there for me.

Simplistic, shiny spectacle would be my best description of SM2. I wasn't familiar with the first game, so I didn't really know what to expect. Extremely overhyped by game reviewers, and I totally fell for it.

Runs well, looks good, but gotta give it a thumbs down. Game will probably settle in around Mostly Positive, which is exactly what it deserves.

For that Warhammer feel, for me personally, I'm just gonna go back to Darktide and Helldivers. For this type of combat, the Batman games are vastly superior as Bruce doesn't fight as if he weighs like a ton of bricks, sloshing his weight around in slow mo.",2024/9/10,en

Вы думали, что Титюшкин на пенсию ушел?
Легендарный опер снова в деле — ему приказали очистить район от алкашни, и он явно собирается устроить самое настоящее космооблаву!

Завязка: Поступила жалоба от соседних созвездий — планета Заливус превратилась в логово отморозков! Тираниды, то бишь местная пьянь и алкашня, заполонили все закоулки и валяются на тротуарах, в космокабачках, под космостолами... Они бухают, дебоширят, поют свои дебильные песни и требуют «по космобутылке» за счёт заведения.

А тут ещё и хаоситы, самые что ни на есть коррумпированные ОПГ-шники галактики! Подкупают всех, от мелких чиновников до стариков на лавочках. И всё это только для того, чтобы протащить свои схемы и свалить все галактические бюджеты себе в карман! А кто главный опер, который умеет раздавать всем по справедливости? Правильно — товарищ Титюшкин!

Что по графону? Весь район выглядит, как после рейда космокозаков, кругом горят мусорки, блестит разбитое стекло, и стоят целые баррикады из пустых бутылок. На планете ни одного целого угла — всё разбито, разломано, как после вечеринки галактических студентов!

Гейплей в целом не дурный! У нас тут полный набор - обыски, налёты, допросы с элементами галактического фольклора. Лупи по спине шокером, и если подозреваемый зашумел, можно и по голове врезать для профилактики! А если попался хаосит, коррумпированный чинуша — устраивай рейд, тяни за жбан в участок и накладывай административные санкции прямо на месте! У Титюшкина два инструмента - жезл и космокодекс, и поверьте, у него есть на всё статья!

Что тут сказать... В уши тебе орут все — от пьянчугов до чинушей, но громче всех, конечно, Титюшкин. Он такой, что без мегафона не обойдётся: «Расходимся, граждане космогаллеи, а то протоколы сейчас начну писать!»

Данная видеоэгра это самый настоящий космодетектив для ценителей спокойного и методичного геймплея! Пора наведаться в галактические кабаки, поставить все космопьянчуги на место и разогнать всю галактическую ОПГ, чтобы даже мышь не проскочила мимо. На вашем жезле уже светится лазером: «Служу космо-народу!», и это не просто слова!

剧情任务流程大约在8-10小时左右，简单难度可能更短
你可以体验到：卡尔加和他的担架队、日常魔怔人牧师、让人充满安全感的救赎者无畏大爹、防弹但不防螺纹钢的头盔（）、这帮机油佬日常搞出幺蛾子、五颜六色带着各种其他战团标志的极限战士x（原铸星际战士是基利曼渗透我们战团的阴谋！！！）、沪爷冲击！！、极限战士到底有多少人等。
但是这款游戏的缺点也是非常明显的：
1、PVP的外挂还是存在的，小懒熊并没有起到什么有效的作用，但是现在随着在线人数的减少外挂也变得少见了
2、PVE过低的角色性能，例如枪袭会被打断、翻滚没有无敌帧、小怪抓两下就消失的纸糊的盾、完美格挡判定时机不明确有时候即使快速摁出了格挡也判定失败、枪虫武士虫等轻易的可以将玩家打出硬直等
3、PVE难度设定不合理，在n3、n4难度为了提升难度居然是粗暴的成倍数的增加怪物的数值并且大幅度减少补给数量，以及会出现强化脑虫和双脑虫同时刷在没有补给的位置，并且有时候队伍组成主要是近战的情况下更加痛苦，被迫直接逃跑；不过官方公告已经说会在后续削减怪物的数值。
4、PVE内容过少，只有六张地图并且高难度基本只有特定的两张图有人，看后续是否会增加新的任务

总之这是一款比较优秀的40k游戏，锤粉可以入手，即使是体验战役也是不错的体验

So far the game mechanics in the campaign are not impressive and overly complex(parrying and dodge system in future war settings? just stupid) beginning of game starts out with an awful map design, felt like a free to play shooter with god awful tutorials even, but maps do look great further in. Everything about it shows they have SOME talent in their dev team but clearly there are a lot of corners being cut.

The tutorial windows, that are like skin shop advertisements being thrown in my face, are not useful... and are more annoying than anything. Giant windows explaining things that anyone would know if they've played a shooter, while making me hold down a key i don't normally use just to get it off my screen. Campaign feels like I'm playing a REALLY messy/clunky batman arkham with waaaaay worse UI and a map that doesn't scale and is overwhelmingly linear. A parry and dodge key for... space marines... feels a little silly in a universe where weapons are so devastating that there is no such thing as parrying, you get hit or you dodge... Was simple and made absolute sense to the 40k universe. And yet everything is ridiculously tanky, absolute bullet sponges with paired dinky sounding effects to really make it feel like you're shooting a water pistol.

The bosses are so insanely stupid, who ever's idea it was to make bosses SO ridiculously over the top tanky shouldn't be in game design, you're bad at it and you clearly need obvious things explained to you like you're a toddler. It's so bad, even to their acknowledgment, that they put in infinite ammo box you can keep restoring your ammo at, BECAUSE, the bosses take about 1,000-2,000 shots each, literally not exaggerating.. All while you can only hold around 100 for each gun.. There is a obvious problem there, this shouldn't need explaining..... But then again, common sense today might as well be considered rocket science, being how our industries/schools are teaching people to use feelings and not work ethics tied with quality/professionalism. From government/politics to corporate shill tools, there are people sadly that want everyone to be gullible emotional idiots, easier money with less/simple PR campaigns..

The sounds... LORD OH MIGHTY THE SOUNDS ARE SO BAD..... It sounds like i'm slapping big pillow enemy's with a 1 handed pillow in every melee fight, shooting sounds like im shooting a pellet gun into air, because only impacts you'll hear are the killing blows.. There is NO opinion about this, nor a polite way of putting it, their audio team is bad. Imagine being in a mechanized suit that is designed to last multiple lifetimes, drops into world war esque battles through out their existence, with a hand cannon that fires rounds that are so large and complex that it has its own propulsion system, only to have it sound like you're firing a nerf gun while wearing heavy boots.. HOW DID THIS PASS STANDARDS FOR THEIR TEAM LEAD?! not saying the game should blow out my ear drums, just some balance would be nice!...

The multiplayer doesn't show much promise with how they're designing a really shallow ""battlepass"" and gimmicky pvp.. Incredibly grindy unlocks, which i don't mind too much oddly. Though some of the unlocks really feel fairly pointless for getting after HOURS of gameplay, like a 1% difference at times, pretty silly.. Chaos space marines jump kicking each other with grapple hooks in 1-ton armor? umm no, wish i didn't get to witness that.. Besides that, really just needs a bigger selection of maps.

Have to say, i loved some of the skins, which feels weird saying seeing they're plugging skin shops day 1 before fixing anything, Darktide vibes, ugh.. Some of the gun-play is good, just the sounds need to be adjusted. The cliche voice acting where you can tell the space marines trying to sound gritty was a bit over the top... Easy to have chaos sound good with it, since they're twisted evil beings, just fits, always does. Doesn't with the good guys, when exaggerated..

To sum it up: really messy game design with an obnoxiously clunky parrying system that has no place in a 40k setting, this isn't Darksouls. THIS SHOULD NOT NEED EXPLAINING, is how i would sum up a lot of their design choices. Go read a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ book about warhammer 40k, drop the emotional truth act, and think critically about what should and shouldn't exist in this platform. How the ♥♥♥♥ has this become so complicated when it's fairly straight forward?

Maybe you guys should focus less on the family photo's before launching a game and more so about being a professional that's making a product that sells its self. Crazy concept huh?

-----------------------------
THAT IS A PROPER WALL OF TEXT, UGH....

This is how 40k eventually will be watered down by really stupid game designs that will possibly leak its way into actual lore. Imagine korn beserkers having batman grapple hooks and jump kicking people in thee most unrealistic way imaginable... Like their team has actual toddlers in it, pitching idea's, literally feels like it, not joking..
impression of clueless toddler esque intern: ""umm boss sir man, i really like the grapple hook the batmans uses, my daddy also likes the batmans"", reply from Teamlead while he is wearing his spin-hat: ""well timmy, we don't need to follow any sort of guidelines, warhammer is an easy cashgrab, put in what makes you feel happy buddy"" Shortly followed by wadding up a fist full of customers money and consuming it like he was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nurgle over lord inflicting pain and disease onto the very soul of currency that mankind is obsessed with.

I truly hope this game gets panned out, i am obsessed with 40k games. I don't want to give this game a bad review. But I'm not about to make a review based on emotions and virtue signaling like you see across steam today..",2024/9/10,en

Gameplay is fine and solid, a pretty enjoyable combat system. Story is exactly what you'd expect, graphics are fine. That's about it.

Optimalization is very subpar.
Connection to online services is very spotty, you'll get stuck at loading screens, disconnected, the ping is not great, etc. It's all hosted on epic online services so go figure.
No FOV slider.
Veteran difficulty does not really make you feel like a space marine, one difficulty level lower is way too easy.

Tyranid section:
Enemies shoot through walls CONSTANTLY, that one elevator section in particular is awful - you have to one-shot it, otherwise after dying you cannot pick-up any medkits/ammo/weapons/etc., it all gets bugged. (reloading the level is not very optimal, the loading screens are so long)
The long-ranged enemies are insanely strong and don't give you too much indication that they are shooting at you. The bigger long-ranged enemies are bullet sponges.
The lyctor boss was underwhelming, repetetive and quite easy. The ""minigun/shotgun"" type enemies the boss spawned in were 100x harder than he was (they melt you down to zero HP in one good burst). They re-use him after as a normal enemy, actually much more fun.
The section with the small critters and the flamethrower was a cool concept but executed extremely poorly - it was more annoying than fun.
The flying enemies have way too much HP.
Teammates missing cutscenes, only see a black screen instead.
The bosses are so uninspired, filled with enemy spam because they are not worth it to fight on their own.

However, after you survive all this bs, the rest of the game is quite enjoyable (the connection and loading issues still persist tho).",2024/9/13,en

1) Соединение с сервером потеряно 10/10 и никакого возмещения за это ни опыта ничего. (играешь соло или с рандомами и выносишь геносемя, 2 данных арсенала и тут раз ""Ничего не было"")
2) Халтура с кастомизацией и внешним видом астарстес ультры.

3) Болтерное оружие. Все еще не раскрыто и не имеет должной убойности. Ощущение стрельбы с автогана. А не из оружия, болты которого при контакте еще и взрываются, нанося дополнительный урон. Так же отсутствие типов боеприпасов на болтерное оружие. (в первой части были перки на болты кракен)

If you miss the mid 2000s games like Gear Of War you will love this one! No Coporate greed BS, no DEI, no ""suprise mechanics"", just big dudes killing big things. My updated review after completing the campagin on veteran and countless OP Missions: this is the best non-RTS 40K game out there at the moment! The last view fights of the campaign are the most 40K boner-material there is!!

Gameplay: Art, graphics, music, atmosphere are top notch. Its war everywhere, like it should be, the weapons have a punch, gore is deliciously over the top. Campaign is a little repetitive during the first half, a problem the first game had too. The second half of the game is amazing with new enemies, guns, locations etc.
Corporate greed/BS: No lootboxes, no microtransactions! Campaign can be played offline, OPs with bots.
Bugs: During the campaign I had one animation bug. Multiplayer was great, I had some connection issues once but thats it.
Balancing: The classes need finetuning in OP/MP, also some weapons.
Difficulty: Played campaign on veteran. Its a challenge sometimes, the defense sections can be hard, but otherwise than that its doable.
Multiplayer: Coop so far was VERY fun and this is where SM2 shines the most!

Verdict so far: To my knowledge everything is lore accurate, they went into great detail in this one. Big dudes with bigger weapons killing stuff, this is what I want to see! If you know 40K you will love this game, its a love letter to all the fans!

Отличная игра, как глоток свежего воздуха, после лета без игр. Впервые заходишь и видишь хорошую картинку и масштабные бои гвардейцев с тиранидами. Огромные локации, инфраструктура империума, гвардейцы держащиеся до последнего - это, что очень нужно для фаната вархаммера, можно долго вглядываться в детали, потому что их очень много, хоть компания и небольшая.

Параллельно с компанией идёт сюжет пве миссий и это очень круто. То есть не только Тит с отрядом выпиливает 99% врагов, другие братья из ордена тоже выполняют не менее важные задание, как например грохнуть тирана улья или поднять корабль и снести им артефакт тысячников. Появляется возможность повоевать с рубрикатами (наконец-то не нурглиты), это очень нестандартно.

Пвп не очень, нужно доработать. Косметика так себе, крутая у определённых классов лоялистов (особенно у бастиона, тактика и равенера). Идея с легионами хаоса имба, но портит её полное отсутствие косметики. Разработчики обещают многое добавить и допилить в игру, поэтому в ожидании)",2024/9/17,ru

Dla wszystkich, którzy czekali na dalszy ciąg historii kapitana Demetriana Titusa, Saber Interactive postanowił przygotować chyba jedną z większych niespodzianek, jeżeli chodzi o premiery 2024 roku. Ultramarine dubbingowany przez kapitalnego Marka Stronga powraca, a wraz z nim i Wy będziecie mieli okazję zmierzyć się z największymi wrogami ludzkości w osadzonym w 40 milenium świecie Warhammera. Czy to udany powrót? Nie narażę się chyba Inkwizycji, jeżeli powiem - jak najbardziej!

The Emperor protects!

Od wydarzeń z pierwszej części gry minęło ponad 200 lat, w trakcie których Titus odbywał swoją pokutę w szeregach Straży Śmierci. W grywalnym samouczku towarzyszymy mu w trakcie jednej z operacji, w której bohater prawie traci życie, stając twarzą w twarz z przeważającymi siłami Tyranidów i pojedynkując się z ogromnym Carnifexem. ""Imperator chroni"" to jednak nie są słowa rzucane na wiatr, więc nasz bohater zostaje poskładany do kupy na pokładzie okrętu wojennego i po raz kolejny trafia na ślad spisku sił chaosu.

Szkielet fabuły pozostaje tutaj podobny do tego, który znamy z pierwszej części. Walka z Tyranidami okazuje się tylko wstępem do inwazji sił Chaosu, a nierozważne zabawy z reliktami osnowy, które uskuteczniają kapłani Adeptus Mechanicus jak nic przypominają graczowi podobne praktyki Inkwizycji z pierwszej części przygód kosmicznego marine. Akcja pędzi na tyle wartko, że zamiast zastanawiać się nad meandrami scenariusza i tak raczej rzucicie się z młotem i bolterem do walki, więc zamiast szukać dziur w całym, lepiej spojrzeć na to, co stanowi najważniejszą część rozgrywki - walkę!


Obcych będziecie ciąć, miażdżyć i rozrywać na strzępy za pomocą całkiem sporego arsenału, zdecydowanie większego niż w pierwszej części. W walce wręcz skorzystacie z czterech różnych rodzajów oręża, do tego dojdzie kilka rodzajów broni bocznej i kilkanaście większych karabinów i miotaczy do walki na krótki, średni i długi dystans.

Arsenał całkiem pokaźny, ale wielkość usprawiedliwiona, jeżeli spojrzeć na to, z kim przyjdzie nam walczyć. Jakimś cudem udało się twórcom przygotować jeszcze większe starcia niż w pierwszej części, a dzięki umiejętnościom Titusa rzucając się nawet na kilkudziesięciu wrogów na raz nie będziecie czuć się bezbronni. Miks walki w zwarciu i wykorzystania broni bocznej nie tylko zapewni ciągłą presję na przeciwnikach, ale w newralgicznych momentach egzekucje na wrogach odnowią życie i pancerz naszego bohatera. Walka to prawdziwa wizyta w rzeźni - krew bucha na wszystkie strony, odcięte kończyny i rozerwane ciała ścielą się gęsto pod stopami potężnego pancerza wspomaganego naszego bohatera.

Sam zapamiętałem pierwszą część gry jako dość monotonne przebijanie się przez kolejne fale przeciwników. Dwójeczka jest moim zdaniem zdecydowanie bardziej dynamiczna, a większa liczba zdolności bohatera w walce wręcz, broni oraz zróżnicowania misji sprawia, że czujemy się cały czas zaangażowani w to, co widzimy na ekranie.


Na uwagę zasługuje zarówno oprawa graficzna, jak i dźwiękowa - moim zdaniem naprawdę jedna i druga robią duże wrażenie. Na ekranie kłębią się roje wrogów, zarówno w powietrzu jak i na ziemi chmary Tyranidów szturmują raz po raz pozycje Gwardii Imperialnej i próbują przeszkodzić naszemu bohaterowi i jego drużynie. Towarzyszą temu rzecz jasna sugestywne odgłosy wybuchów, krzyki wrogów i sojuszników. Dudnienie bolterów, przeszywający powietrze dźwięk laserów i walnięcia w ziemię potężnego elektrycznego młota przyprawiają o ciarki na plecach, a jeżeli dołożymy do tego naprawdę niezły dubbing i aktorów, którzy z zaangażowaniem wypowiadają swoje kwestie, to dostajemy naprawdę udaną mieszankę.


- krwawa jatka bez trzymanki;
- satysfakcjonujący feeling walki;
- poprawione mankamenty pierwszej części;
- ładna oprawa graficzna;
- świetna oprawa dźwiękowa;

- zbyt wyraźnie powtarza schemat fabularny pierwszej części;
- okazjonalne problemy z połączeniem z innymi graczami;
- przydałby się jakiś rozwój zdolności Titusa, a nie tylko towarzyszących mu wojowników w ramach Operacji;
- brak aktywności pobocznych w bazie operacyjnej;
- względnie mało misji w trybie Operacje (choć ciągle dochodzą nowe);",2024/9/9,pl
zackbob6,1,43.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198371852446/,"UPDATE to positive after patch 3.1:
By the Emperor, they did it! They fixed the game! The crashes stopped and they fixed the Linux/Steam Deck compatibility issue! We just got through two more story missions together tonight (10/11/24) and it was a BLAST! Thank you devs so much for creating this amazing game! Hopefully it doesn't get broken with another patch again. If it does, at least now I can trust it will be fixed.
The game is very fun and has just so much cool set design; really nails the whole 40K aesthetic. And I love running into stuff or hearing someone talk about something in the lore and then being able to explain it to my Warhammer-novitiate cousins and they go ""Ohhhh that's so coool!"" In tonight's session, the older one noticed a servitor plugged into the wall as he was walking past and he was like ""Woah guys guys come look at this! Its the most messed up thing so far; he's like plugged into the wall!"" And then I got to explain how the guy was probably a criminal, but maybe a failed astartes aspirant depending on the chapter... or just someone that someone else didn't like haha. We are having a great time and it is really getting them into the universe in a great way. Again, thank you for fixing it under the guidance of the Omnissiah. Praise be to the Emperor!

Original negative review after patch 3.0:
I love this game soooo much man, it hurts me to leave a negative review. This 3.0 patch really messed it up for me and my cousins though. It crashes like every 5 minutes now. And one of them was playing on a Steam Deck and now it doesn't even let Linux users login for online play any more? It worked before the patch just fine and we had already played through the first 2 story missions and the first Operations mission. Just wasted 3 hours TRYING to play through more of the story. First had to install it on a spare computer so the Steam Deck user could play. Now every time we go into a mission it works for about 5 minutes then crashes. Whole game freezes, white screen, windows does the whole ""This program isn't responding"" thing. Just so disappointed right now. Will change this if they fix it and I desperately hope they do, otherwise we wasted about $175.",2024/9/28,en

MidnightLycanroc,1,277.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MidnightLycan/,"First hour of the game is watching the same freezing cinematic, glad it released for me to get this enjoyable unforgettable experience. :) I'm sure it's a great game to the people able to play it, but apparently this is a ongoing issue with a lot of people. Lucky us. Can't recommend for a sixty dollar price tag, unless you wait for some patches when you can't even get out of the opening without troubleshooting.

Edit after 15 hours played.

The sluggishness in the cinematic cutscenes can really dampen the intended effect of awe at the things you get to see in this game up close from the amazing 40k universe. The game is worth it.. but maybe wait a while for them to fix some of their bugs, since their mentality seems to be they believe it's ""rare"" to encounter these issues. Both me and hubby ran this and had the same exact issues on completely different machines, and when you see you've experienced every issue on their bug list that has ""rare"" listed for the bug occurances as much as there are bugs in the game.. well.

For anyone having the same issue I and hubby had with the game where it wouldn't load the first opening cutscene, among others. Try disabling any overlays you have including steam overlay. Game doesn't really seem to like it much. Good luck fellow Astartes, The Emperor protects.

Many more hours in and I learn the game has finally gotten its private lobby systems.. along with a whole new host of bugs. Love the game, but its got some issues. The matchmaking systems and servers are an absolute mess. I tried to log in with the hubby to play today and can't even get it to stop disconnecting me. We couldn't log in at all yesterday either of us. It's a shame, cause the peeps that play this tend to be really cool an chill to hang out with while squashing the emperor's enemies.. but in order to really enjoy the experience the best option if your on pc, can't speak for console is to turn cross play off.

我是米其林三星主厨，我来选择今天的餐品,0,185.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/19831561279/,"致敬各位战斗兄弟和游戏设计师Saber
游戏的更新与优化不应该是为了带给玩家更好的体验码？为什么游戏更新优化后比以前更加卡顿以及不稳定。还有一些设定让我难以忍受。
第一点、四级与五级难度下，为何一定要绑定所有玩家一起走，我玩的明明是星际战士2，不是战锤版三人成行。许多武器和技能机制，想要在战斗中酣畅游玩必须要与队友拉开距离，提供交叉火力。比如说：特战兵的等离子武器和狙击兵的激光狙。星际战士庞大的体型很容易阻挡队友的枪线。还有突击兵的跳跃背包，他的职业定位必须要突进到敌人后方打击重点目标，一旦脱离队伍就失去加成在高难度的情况下岂不是有来无回。我很庆幸，你没有开启友伤模式。

第二点、武器问题，各种爆弹枪主武器明明都已经这么弱了，根本没几个玩家会选择它作为战力武器，反而作为娱乐枪械。这一点儿也不忠诚。我弹夹都打空了都清不完怪物浪潮。这把武器的意义是什么，致敬传统它便应该存在。希望设计师可以慎重考虑我的提议，将爆弹类武器加强，别再那般一无是处。

第三点、还是要吐槽一下服务器的稳定性，一两个小时就可能触发一次掉线或者崩溃。快要到手的胜利瞬间化为泡影，作为队伍里唯一希望的最后修士掉线谢幕。直接导致战斗的失败。大家都不是心若冰心，天塌不惊的圣人。你是在考验玩家的血压吗？总结就一句话：恶心！太恶心了！！！

第四点、设计师们和游戏制作团队你们不要试图教所有玩家玩游戏，你们真的会玩你们自己制作的游戏吗？上一个这么作死的PVE游戏团队叫作绝地潜兵二（HELLDIVERS2）。他给所有玩家拉了一坨大的狗屎，现在已经被喷的体无完肤，改回了之前的设定（已老实）。你们难道想复刻它的失败，我愿称之为卧龙凤雏。

Bolt weapons feel wimpy, with most basic enemies beyond humans taking more shots than is fun, and you as a space marine feeling rather wimpy as well.

The multiplayer aspect is fun, but pretty much every single mission is identical to the last, on maps that look identical 90% of the time. For the price point I wouldn't say its worth it. Maybe when its $30-40 id say 100% go for it, or after a few more major content drops.",2024/11/7,en

PROS:
1. Le jeu est très beau, le style Grim Dark lié à Warhammer 40k est bien représenté. Le Lore est sympathique et le Environmental Design est très réussi mais...

3. Un gameplay nerveux et réactif mais...

6. L'aspect massacre très jouissif de massacre à la tronçonneuse mais...
7. Des super moments épiques...

CONTRE:
1. Un Level Design paresseux. Les missions et la campagne ont toujours le même schéma (couloir → arène → couloir → arène...).
2. Des temps de chargements parfois long mais acceptable.
3. Un verrouillage de caméra perfectible.
4. ...Qui s'estompe après une centaine de fois. De plus, en mode Vétéran, il est quasi nécessaire, de faire des exécutions pour éviter les dégâts. Car il y a peu de couverts et les soins sont quasi inexistant (en mode Vétéran) hormis la capacité spéciale qui n'est pas souvent disponible). C'est peut-être beaucoup plus facile...en facile...
5....A difficulté élevée, les armes sont des pistolets à bouchons sur des ennemis autre que les petits mobs. De plus, peu importe l'arme à feu choisie, vous ne voyez quasiment aucune différence.
6....c'est pas mal obligatoire de jouer au contact.
7. ...Hélas trop peu nombreux et pas représentatif du jeu.

Le jeu est très sympa avec des moments épiques mais... . Le jeu ressemble à un Gears of War avec le skin ""Warhammer 40k"" mais sans l'aspect Cover-Shooter. Le Gameplay est basique mais réactif.

Это наудивление интересная игра, не типичная для нашего времени.

В базе это гибрид шутера от третьего лица и слешера. Чего больше в миксе не могу судить ибо видел заявление что ""стрелять не дают, только махатся"" и "" они убили рукопашку ради пострелушек"". Агрумент за то что больше пострелять. В игре прям очень много болтерного (будет считать гмо огнестрелом) мейн оружия, а вот рукопашного всего 4 (в мп ещё есть завезли поверфистинг) 3 пистолета и 3 тяжелого оружия (в мп и сингле разный третий ствол) и при этом патронов часто хватает, раздачники патронов часто встречаются на аренах и в целом нет врага которого нельзя тупо растрелять. Так же переход к системе двух хп когда здоровье не регенится без ульты и аптечек,а броня по факту восполняемое хп подталкивает чаще отстреливатся из укрытий. за рукопашку во главе угла говорит сильно прокаченая система боя где добавили к перекатам блок, все выпады врагов имеют визуальный маркер и даже указан тип защиты для противодействия, рукопашные атаки могу застанить под квик шот халявный на реген брони а добивания не ток восполняют броню, но и неуязвимы на время анимации (как и перекат). И при этом больше не выйдет пострелять нормально от бедра дальше вытянутой руки - извольте переходить в режим стрельбы что блочит добивание и снижает мобильность. Суть гемплея как раз в частом комбинировании этих двух режимов.

Сама игра чётко делится на три режима - сюжет, пве и пвп. Сюжетная кампания построенна на ликалах игр нулевых и десятых. Много эпичных кадров, пафоса (а у нас тут варшлёп 40к на минуту) и разных ситуаций (то защищай это, то прыгай с джетпаком, то гоняй рой). Кампания средня по продолжительности (часов +-8) кишкобразная без собирательства и рпг элементов или стелса. Беги стреляй, убивай, смотри мультки... И это хорошо, ибо добро сделаная попкорновая сюжетка в наши дни редкость. Сам сюжет не замысловат, есть атмосфера бадимуви, но местами диалоги больше пафосные, чем интересные(есть пара прям отличных, но порой тупо разговор у кого долг больше). В целом впечатления хорошие, НО игра словно затачивалась под кооп от чего некоторые момент бесят - крути винт пока ии компетентно (нет) тебя прикрывает.

ПвЕ у нас этакий дарктайд на максималках. Во первых самое крутое - наши миссии вплетены в основной сюжет и нам по ходу игры говорят ""действуют два отряда, ваша цель такая, а они будут делать такое"" и можно даже порой между миссиями поболтать гг с игроками коопа. Сами мисси имеют чёткую задачу и врагов, но само наполнение и динамика задания меняется по прихоти режиссёра .У нас 6 классов, кажды представляет из себя конкретного бойца б тима но кроме лиц редактируем всё (об этом позже). Оружие доступно сразу всё, за прокачку класса мы открываем пасивные перки (активка у классов всегда прописана) и за использования оружия мы качаем его мастерство открывая варианты и перки. И тут большой минус ибо в игре очень сурово поделили сволы по классам. Солдат бегает аж с 7 пушками на выбор, а у авангарда их всего 3, зато есть выбор между мечом или ножом, снайпер же даже не может пистолет себе выбрать. В принципе это хорошо сделаный режим с парой отличный идей (точки где можно сменить набор оружия по ходу задания и офицеры что могут призвать подкоепы если их быстро не устранить)

Про врагов. Тираниды шикарно сделаны, есть множество вариантов войнов и прикольные особые враги.прикольная связь элитов и мяса, элиты ну прилично жирные, а мясо очень даде мешает и демажет... НО, ПРИ СМЕРТИ ЭЛИТА МЕЛОЧ ОТЛЕТАЕТ ВОКРУГ. Это даёт неплохую динамику когда ты либо концентрируешься на жёстком файте с элитами или осторожно выкашиваешь мясо ради лучшего боя с элитами (и благодоря маркерам легко читать откуда угроза) само поведение тиранидов радует - бегут роем по при обстреле бросаются в расыпную, когда элит фокусит игрока пытаются со спины подгадить ну и есть моменты где они как в фильмазъх друг по другу лезут на стены. Хаоситы же вышле более класическими но в отличии от первой части не превращают игру в шутер с укрытиями. Достаточно хорошоре разнообразие врагов (хотя щитоносцы тзангоры как-то слишком хорошо держут удар) и так же как с тиранидами с ними играть не выйдет.

И про ПвП это класический арена шутер притом прям ну эталонно класический. 6 на 6 без дропов, три режима. Забавно но тут хп само регенится. Достаточно весело и ттк достаточно высокий чтобы при хорошем уровне игры побеждать. Никаких перков ,модулей и прочего, чисто берём класс и оружие (за уровни пвп мы эти самые пушки и открываем). Главный минус это отсутвие skill-based матчмейкинга, так что часто матчи идут в одну калитку, даже если ты тащумба , игра просто могла кинуть тебе вась подпивасов а врагам набрать играков что каждый день по 6 часов минимум играют. Кстати, хаоситы у нас вместо классов фактически поделены на легионы со своей специализацией (клоны см геймплейно) а вот что грустно - кастомизировать можно ток раскраску брони, нет ни скинов оружия, не деталей брони.

Кстати о кастомизации... Она оболденная, можно каждую колленку настроить, вариантов цветов много, деталик пока не прям много... Но как бы уже есть сизон пасс и там только косметика. В целом разрабы обещали только косметику монетизировать без микротранзакций а из разряда купил 1 раз пак. По графону и оптимизации. Играл на двух машинах. В целом игра работает не плохо, но у многих необосновано нагревает процессор и есть баги соьзвуком и роликами.

По итогу игра сделана почти 1 в 1 как условный гирз оф вар 2 с иксбокс 360... И это хорошо, так сейчас уже редко делают",2024/9/8,ru

Класс со щитом отдельный вид аутизма, как вы не старайтесь, какое оружие не используйте им пох*ру они просто стоят и впитывают урон, к примеру у девостаторов есть энерго щит который при нанесении урона ломается почему не сделать стамину у щитовика что бы он как да*н не стоял с зажатой кнопкой блока или что бы проходил процент урона от попадания со временем увеличивающийся? Но видимо желание думать о ПВП режиме напрочь отсутствовало!

Надеюсь над ПВП будут работать и развивать так как не хотелось бы быстро забывать об этой игре!
Так же разработчикам может быть интересно добавить всяких dlc и прочего контента для удержания в игре большого количества игроков на продолжительное время, так как сейчас ситуация такова, что компанию при спокойном геймплее можно пройти часов за 8 если не меньше а дальше, что? просто забыть?

Seth Brogan,0,42.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sethamphetamemes/,"Campaign was good, graphics good, story good, operations good, pvp good. But I have one major issue with the game's progression of difficulty. Its feigned, or poorly executed.

TL;DR: Game felt good at first, but as you progress in difficulty, it loses it's shine.. The game's enemies don't increase in number, rather they increase in health as you go up in difficulty, so the enemies are spongier, not harder. This paired with the mechanics of survival on higher difficulty ruined the game for me.

Full explanation:

Instead of throwing more enemies at you, or more variety, they just make the enemies spongier, (give them more health and resistance to stagger.) Same enemy, same moves. Just now it takes 2-3 mags of ammo, instead of 1. Guns feel under powered/useless at higher difficulties.

On the 1st or the 2nd difficulty, you feel like an Astartes, you feel powerful. You charge into combat, your teammates don't need constant supervision. Your weapons feel powerful. Knock it up to 3 difficulty, everything still feels good, weapons are okay, but melee seems more effective.

You hit difficulty 4, all of a sudden your guns feel pretty weak, even gold tier, max perked weapons. Dumping full mags into enemies skulls, and having to reload before they give an execute window. Enemy attacks can nearly wipe your health bar, with one hit. (Speaking about Majoris/Extremis here, the small enemies are never really a huge issue, even on max diffy). Juggling armor charges becomes a chore.

Playing on 5's isn't even playing the same game. No longer do you feel like an Astartes charging into combat, now you're literally just running around scrounging for life stem's and looking for the ever scarce ammo,(which is now even more limited with caps on uses), for a gun that feels useless. All of this while probably roll spamming to wait for your teammates re-spawn timer. This was 9/10 of my 5's, just running for your life, while praying your teammates are doing the same and not dying.

Final Take:

Game was a blast for 40 hours, but if I gotta play like a b!$%# to play on the higher difficulty, that's not fun. Ill still play a 3-4 with friends, but it feels like a chore as I know this game is gonna end up in the uninstalled folder after month or two.",2024/11/8,en

MicNat666,1,30.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/micnat/,"Jako fan Uniwersum Warhammera 40,000 od 1998 roku, muszę przyznać, że Space Marine 2 to prawdziwy hołd dla tego niesamowitego świata. Gra idealnie uchwyciła brutalność, epickość i bezkompromisowy charakter bitew znanych z uniwersum, jednocześnie dostarczając satysfakcjonującej i dynamicznej rozgrywki. Od pierwszych chwil czułem, jakby cała historia, którą śledziłem przez dekady, ożywała na ekranie.

Kontynuacja przygód Ultramarine'ów nie zawiodła. Akcja jest intensywna, pełna niesamowitych momentów, które sprawiają, że czułem się, jakby sam Imperator prowadził mnie do boju. Walka z hordami Tyranidów to czysta rozkosz dla każdego fana tego świata. Animacje, dźwięki, a zwłaszcza design wrogów i środowisk, oddają mroczny i gotycki klimat 41. millenium. Każdy krok bohatera – od ryku boltera, przez majestatyczne wybuchy, po dźwięk ciężkich butów Space Marine na metalowej powierzchni – przypomina mi, dlaczego Warhammer 40,000 to uniwersum pełne niesamowitej głębi i unikalnej atmosfery.

Mechanika gry została udoskonalona w stosunku do poprzedniej części. Nowe ruchy i płynność w walce pozwalają poczuć się, jak prawdziwy Astartes – nadludzko szybki, silny i bezlitosny. Do tego dodajmy epickie starcia, które ukazują bezmiar i skomplikowanie bitew Warhammera.

Co najważniejsze, Space Marine 2 nie jest tylko grą akcji – to przeżycie, które pozwala na nowo poczuć dumę i chwałę Ultramarines, którzy stoją na straży Imperium. Fani Uniwersum Warhammera na pewno będą zachwyceni, widząc, jak wiernie oddano lore, a nowe wątki fabularne tylko pogłębiają zainteresowanie tym fantastycznym światem.

Dla każdego fana – zarówno nowicjusza, jak i weterana od 1998 roku – Space Marine 2 to obowiązkowa pozycja, która doskonale łączy dynamikę gry akcji z bogatym dziedzictwem Warhammera 40,000. Polecam z całego serca!",2024/9/8,pl

Mister Kad,1,45,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mister_Kad/,"Gonna be completely honest, after the first 30 minutes of optimization hell, I am safe to say that the early trials were worth it. A story that sticks to the core of 40k, the beautiful, immersive set pieces. This is THE 40k game I've been waiting for. The combat system has taken some time to get used to, but there's nothing more satisfying than pulling off a chain of executions and heavy hitting slams into the horde that surrounds you (before you turn the entire place into a red mist). And it's not just the melee. The ranged weapons have the most satisfying bolter punches I've seen in a 40k game yet.

The multiplayer PVP mode could use some balancing, and the campaign AI really needs a tweak or two, but this is something that nobody is a stranger to at this point. It's an expected headache when you make gameplay surrounding co-op and then give us robots with the brains of a sloth to back us up.

Newest Patch - Nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf..... Still a huge NO from me, friends have already moved on, many issue still around. Should of been boosting useless skills and weapons and not nerfing good things. Gawd help solo players.

Older patch - Infinite black screen on mission launch. Talk about cocking up their game.

Co-Op missions (affecting my friends and I), Launch mission, Load into black screen, stumble around in the dark to find the launch area again, if we get lucky mission might start. But then loads incorrect mission to what we chose. Very poor Quality Assurance on Sabers behalf to release such a poorly done patch.

Currently the Dev's have no clue on which way to go with this game, tweaking balance to the complainers about how hard it is (its not hard) and now this patch makes the game unplayable for quite a few.

We'll see if the Dev's can fix this asap, and I might thumbs up this review. But as it stands, releasing a patch not ready for release was a very bad move.

I don't hold our for much to change, its radio silence from the Dev's on Steam, which is a shame really.

FaceRekt,1,119.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FaceRekt/,"An excellent game with some performance issues on lower-end pc's (I'm still rocking a 1080Ti because GPUs are stupid expensive still).

Pros:
- This game *nails* the 40k aesthetic and environment better than any game before it - even Darktide.
- 3 game modes on launch. Even if Eternal War has some server issues, having more options on launch is good. Operations will get fleshed out further based on roadmap being posted by devs, so there'll be even more content to dig through later.
- Combat feels pretty good! The default control scheme on mouse and keyboard is a little whack, but you get used to it (or you can change it). Only thing is you *will* get animation trapped sometimes. It just happens.
- Visceral executions are a delight to watch

Cons:
- Story is fine I guess, any complaints I have are spoilers.
- Enemy variety is a little low.
- The AI for your two squadmates in solo-Campaign are *not* okay. They suck ass. Will frequently not target enemies, not execute stunned enemies, will not target enemies attacking objectives, sometimes won't even res you if you go down. Play with friends, or play on Easy (game doesn't have achievements for beating campaign on set difficulties, just for beating campaign at all) because playing on the hardest difficulty without friends has a few very acute pain points in the story. Otherwise, game isn't actually that hard.
- Eternal War (PvP) mode is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Time to kill is way too short, and there seems to be no rails on who you can get match-making into. So if you're a new guy into the PvP mode, you can get matched with people with all - and I mean *all* - the unlocked gear and get totally ♥♥♥♥ on until you catch up. Which can take a while, given you're getting ♥♥♥♥ on. This mode needs a rework, ASAP.
- The pay to get early access was scummy. Wish companies would stop this ♥♥♥♥.
- Performance issues; I've got an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 16GB of RAM, and a 1080Ti. Game runs well enough but has some serious hangups once in a while even on Low settings. Possibly just lag from people joining/leaving sessions, but it's hard to tell if it's my hardware or the network. I'm overdue for an upgrade, so this might be an entirely *me* problem.
- Solo queueing into Operations is a similar annoyance in lack of team cohesion that solo-ing into LFD2 or *any* co-op PvE will bring you. People will run ahead, ignoring enemies, letting teammates die, just to try and run the level as fast as possible. Annoying as ♥♥♥♥, as it always is.

A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
By: Hawk


The loading.. dear god the loading screens are everywhere... whenever you move to another segment of the ship, loading screen, load a save loading screen, load back into your own ship from coop to campaign.. loading screen, loading back to the main menu... loading when just trying to switch lobbies, loading screen. Loading screens for every single aspect of this game and the loading takes way too long even on the recommended SSD. I can not imagine how slow this loads on a standard spin drive... it's sad honestly how poorly optimized in that department this game is.

The balance in this game is horrendous, your super human space marines are like paper and our weapons shoot hugs and kisses while every single enemy in the entire game are guaranteed one shot kills on ALL difficulties. Even in the singleplayer campaign you can feel your lack of ability to stay alive and do damage but it's not as apparent until you start playing the pathetically small number of 6 whole coop operations missions. Then you see the game for what it really is, spongy enemies and weak paper thin player durability. At no point do you ever feel powerful, even maxed out Astartes Primaris Marines can only take 1 or 2 hits before they are dead while you get zero ability to regen health, unlike Space Marine 1, where upon doing a finisher you would regain health. In the squeal that was NOT made by the same developers by the way, you regain lost health IF you get to it in time, which is barely a second before you drop to the new health position. This makes the horrible gameplay balance all the more apparent when you start playing any sort of difficulty. Most of the actual combat is just you trying to parry 500000 enemies on screen or dodging constantly, it is incredibly boring and tedious. I think the devs watched too much Dark Souls or something because this is not even close to what Space Marine 1 was about. Want to actually stand and fight? Nope dodge roll everywhere, the game spawns far too many enemies that will oneshot you regularly even while you're spamming parry or dodge, it's broken.

Maxing out one class in the coop is great and all until you run into a lobby that has another person using your class so then you get to figure out which lower leveled class you can pick so that you can even play. Lower level classes are statically weaker and have less team aid, leveling your characters up is a chore and half of the perk tree on each is totally arbitrary ""5% better accuracy"" that kind of thing. Stuff that should be just a flat upgrade to your class in any other game like this, in SM2 it's a ""feature"" that you're nerfed all of the time. There is zero power fantasy, be it from your class or your weapons.

On the weapons front, 90% of ALL weapons are in the trash bin, clearly the devs never set foot in the game past easy, maybe, this game reeks of the same type of poor balancing that killed Helldivers 2, make the player weak, and strengthen the NPCs at all times. On the subject of weapons, the only way to ""upgrade"" from your starting weapon to Tiers 2-4 is to find servitor skulls that give you an upgrade token to be spent on a single weapon that you will then have to use several of in that tier then find another upgrade token in the next difficulty, repeat the process then find the last upgrade token for THAT weapon. If you are unable to do the other 2 higher difficulties you will be missing out on 2/3rds of your weapon upgrades, that's right you are all but walled off from progress or fun by a difficulty spike. By the way these are not guaranteed, you have to FIND these things, 1 per mission over the course of 40+ minutes per mission on average, again similar to Samples in HD2, which is not a good idea I might add. You can get a second one from beating a boss that can randomly spawn in some sections of the mission but you run the risk of failing the mission thus getting basically nothing for your time. The weapon upgrading system is bad, simply put, if you take your starting weapon and try to use it on Tier 4 difficulty you will do ZERO damage to every.single.enemy. Even after you upgrade all weapons save for 3, the Melta Rifle, the Las Fusil and the Multi Melta, those are the only 3 weapons that can even compete, the rest are so underpowered it’s clear that the devs did not use anything other than those 3 during any testing that they may have done (which could not have been much given the state of the game).
The quintessential Space Marine weapons, the Bolter based weapons, are some of the worst in the entire game, bar none, they do no damage, have horrible rates of fire and hold almost no ammo.

Another issue with the balance is that the higher you go up in difficulty the game suddenly turns into WWZ, except you’re weaker than survivors in a zombie game. You have to scrounge for ammo, med kits and any other supplies during the entire match. The ultra prepared Astartes have to scrounge for ammo…. Let that sink in please. This mechanic just adds to the additional frustration that you can have when trying to unwind after coming home from work, now you get to “work” again by grinding a single character with a single few weapons for hours only to make little to no progress even on Tier 4 difficulty. The limited number of ops missions is just 6, yes you heard me, only 6, 3 of which have a faction that are some of the least fun to fight against so barely anyone plays them so realistically you only have 3 missions that you will then have to farm ad-nauseam to get level up your characters, weapons and get cosmetics. It is such a pathetic offering that honestly makes me think that this is yet another Beta full priced release by a greedy developer and publisher. Oh they have a “plan” with a roadmap next year they plan on adding 1 (ONE) additional coop mission, that is all they plan on adding, maybe a hoard mode next year but we don’t know anything about it. This is a very hollow game honestly, if you get it just for the singleplayer fine but do not buy anything beyond that, it is simply not worth it for what they are charging versus what is offered.

The good is that besides your slow speed (which gets you killed far too often to count, everything is faster than you apparently even though in the lore it is stated that “nothing that big should move so quickly”) you feel tanky, at least in your movement, the actual combat no you feel as if you’re made out of single ply toilet paper. The sound effects and visual effects and graphics are great. Story is good for a Space Marine game, characters are good, build up throughout the whole game is good.

Oh and as a side note, Saber Interactive makes sure to hide this but upon installing the game, you’re also forced to install the Epic Game Store. Why?! Well according to the developers, it's their way of doing crossplay, why you ask? Well they sure don’t share with us the details, it’s strange how many other games have connect to both Epic and Steam versions just fine without forcing you to install EGS. Something to keep in mind, if you do not want that spyware on your PC then do not buy this, you NEED to have it installed in order to play with anyone, period. The devs made sure that you suffered if you dared to prefer your own system’s integrity and privacy.

Maybe once Saber Interactive gets their stuff together and balances the game and adds more content that should have been in when SM2 was released then maybe things will change. Right now though it’s nothing but frustration by the gameplay and the horrible netcode and match making system that Saber clearly did not test thoroughly enough.",2024/9/25,en

Сюжет в какой-то мере повторяет первую часть, потому как не учатся ничему некоторые, и учиться не хотят. Но даже не смотря на вторичность сюжета, исполнение выше всяких похвал. Уделено большое внимание к деталям игрового мира, сочные взрывы и стрельба, достойное звуковое сопровождение и общая эпичность происходящего на экране надолго осядут в памяти.
Помимо сюжета имеются 6 операций, которые происходят параллельно основному сюжету. Играть можно с ботами, но на сложностях выше нормальной с ботами играть больно, потому что они тупенькие, не добивают врагов, не захватывают точки и не выполняют различные сюжетные действия, а одному успеть всюду сложновато. Поэтому рекомендую играть в кооперативе. Благо, подбор игроков происходит быстро.
Мультиплеерные бои по классике быстрые и несложные. Хотя уже сейчас есть игроки, которые в совершенстве изучили локации и прокачали своих бойцов. Но прокачка дело времени. Просто играем и получаем удовольствие.

DELTA ㋛,1,44.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DELTICH/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 — чистокровная видеоигра, которая не стыдится быть такой какая она есть. Ваша цель — просто прийти и уничтожить все на своем пути, ничего больше. При этом разработчики пошли на смелый шаг, полностью отказавшись от любой прокачки героя или оружия в сюжетной кампании. Если вы устали от очередных Юбисфот дрочилен и других современных игр, где на пять минут геймплея приходится 30 минут копания в разных меню, чтобы сила удара стала на 1% больше, а вы просто хотите порубить мобов на части с красивой графикой и крутой боевкой — Space Marine 2 как раз для вас.

Space Marine II работает на собственном движке Swarm Engine, и это, пожалуй, одна из немногих игр, которые наконец-то демонстрируют тот самый «почти некстген». От детализации окружения, брони персонажей, дальности прорисовки, потрясающего освещения и масштабов игры порой попросту захватывает дух. Одним из самых заметных изменений в игре является ее визуальное оформление, детализированные модели персонажей и окружения, мрачные, кровавые пейзажи и эпичные и масштабные сцены сражений создают непередаваемую атмосферу, которая идеально соответствует духу вселенной Warhammer 40К. Звуковое оформление также на высоте — динамичные и напряженные бои сопровождаются мощными звуковыми эффектами и грандиозным музыкальным сопровождением, которое делает каждый бой еще более запоминающимся. Также разработчики учли критику и отзывы игроков о первой части, внедрив ряд значительных улучшений. Одним из главных нововведений стала более крутая и глубокая боевка. Теперь игрокам предстоит сталкиваться с еще более разнообразными врагами, каждый из которых требует особого подхода и стратегии. Система прокачки персонажей также была значительно расширена, предоставляя больше возможностей для кастомизации и развития навыков героя (но это по большей части сделано для коопа, для кампании сделан просто выбор оружия, ну и 2 два вида брони, если у вас Delux издание).

Сюжет в Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 звезд с неба не хватает, но он стал более насыщенным. Он продолжает развивать историю оригинала, но при этом вводит новые элементы, которые добавляют глубины. Персонажи, как новые, так и знакомые с первой части, получили более проработанные истории и мотивации, что позволяет игрокам глубже погружаться в происходящее. Описать весь сюжет можно буквально в двух предложениях, поскольку история здесь служит скорее причиной что-нибудь взорвать и кого-нибудь уничтожить. Большая часть заданий сводится к тому, что герои должны заложить бомбу, навести пушку или не дать монстрам уничтожить важный объект, а основной конфликт развивается на фоне, лишь в финальной трети давая о себе знать. В принципе, от сюжета во вселенной Warhammer большего и не требуется.

Если подвести итоги, новый Space Marinе в 2024 году выглядит как идеальный боевик в мире Warhammer 40К, как мессия жанра, с болтером в одной руке и пиломечом в другой. Новая часть несомненно оправдал все мои ожидания и принесла множество нововведений, которые делают игру не только попкорновым и мясным зрелищем с отличной графикой, захватывающим звуковым оформлением и улучшенной механикой, но и представляет собой достойное продолжение, если так можно сказать «успешного» оригинала. Если вы являетесь поклонником вселенной Warhammer 40К или просто любите качественные экшен-игры типа Gear of War, это продолжение определенно стоит вашего внимания. Несмотря на ряд недостатков, проведённые в сюжетной кампании Space Marine II 10 часов подарили мне одни из самых приятных впечатлений в 2024 году — именно такой игры нам всем не хватало последние лет пять.",2024/9/7,ru

Sure developers can pull quantitative data on everything that players do in a game; however, this does not provide any insight into the qualitative reasons why players make the choices that they do. Here's a pro marketing tip for you Focus: players enjoy feeling overpowered, and nerfs are the opposite of fun. If you think there is no other choice but to nerf something, then you might want to wrap it in a 'buff sandwich' so players don't resent you.

А где повестка? Почему нет женщин астартес?!


Играть только на самом высоком уровне сложности, серьёзно!


Мясная игра, отличное продолжение первой части!
Это если в двух словах, далее по игре.
Начало, лично для меня было неожиданным, с высадки космо-десантников ""Караул Смерти""! ГДЕ УЛЬТРАМАРИНЫ?!
И только когда наш космодес снял шлем, все стало на свои места :)

Передать восторг от мясной нарезки тиранидов просто невозможно! Особенно если играть на джостике от PS5, чувствовать сопротивление курков с каждым выстрелом, вибрацию при беге на каждый шаг добавляет ощущения тяжести космодеса, мощи болтера!





Когда в начале игры тебе показывают рой тиранидов бегущий, где то там в далеке, то тебя это не сильно беспокоит, это же фон, ведь так? Ведь так?!
Но по мере приближения этой огромной толпы, ты понимаешь, что это не фон, что это не статичные болванчики, это реально огромная толпа врагов, которую тебе нужно выкосить в одиночку! И их не остановят высокие стены, они как те зомби из фильма с Бредом Петровичем , эти ксеносы просто построят живую лестницу и придут за тобой!





За первые часы я умирал не единожды, но это не отпугнуло меня пересесть на более легкую сложность, наоборот, экшен настолько задорный, кровавый, брутальный, что хочется хардкора!
Боёвка не сильно сложна: есть цепной меч или нож для ближнего боя, есть болт-пистолет и полноценный болтер, и конечно есть уворот и парирование.
Тактика боя:
Пока враг далеко, стреляем с Болтера.
Когда близко, бъем мечом, парируем, восстанавливаем HP.
Добиваниями восстанавливаем броню.

К слову парирования убивает мелочь сразу, а более серьезного противника на мгновение , для нашей атаки цепным мечом. Вот добивания крупной дичи особенно кровавы! То космодес оторвет клешню тираниду и засунет ему под ребро, то вырвет позвоночник, то растопчет голову...брр...жесть!





Графика тут неплоха, именно что не плоха, не идеальна. Как по мне, графика, могла быть и лучше, но это моё мнение.
Да тут много графических мелочей, кровь стекает по броне и плащу ГГ, грязь цепляется на сапоги брони и разлетается в стороны от громовой поступи, взрывы, достаточно детализированы элементы брони.
НО! На первой же планете, цветокор такой странный выцвевше серый.... Когда заходишь в здания, яркость цветов возвращается. Не знаю, мож я что не так накрутил в яркости )

На моём не топовом ведре , игра идет с просадками до 70 фпс на максимальных настройках (за исключением размытия в движении, отключил нафиг).

На момент написания подключиться к серверам, тот еще квест. Потому компанию прохожу в офлайн режиме. Но как только игра стартанёт для стандарт издания буду проходить (или может уже перепроходить) компанию с другом.

PVP режим пока не смотрел, возможно дополню обзор позже.





Я взял ультра издание и не пожалел!
Игра стоит своих денег, комон ребята, это же ВАХА!
Красивая картинка с достойной оптимизацией.

Пройдя ""Операции"" на трёх сложностях (последняя сложность в процессе покорения), перепройдя пару раз сюжетку в соло и с товарищами, поразвлекавшись в PvP, думаю, пришло время и отзыв оставить

Если кратко - хорошо, даже очень, но есть куда расти и что балансировать и добавлять!
В совокупности моя личная оценка 4 из 5


Сюжетная кампания
Сюжетная кампания является прямым продолжением первой части. Сама по себе сюжетка короткая, примерно на 4-7 часов прохождения в зависимости от ваших игровых навыков и т.д.
Несмотря на столь короткое время, сюжетная составляющая вполне насыщена событиями, проработкой визуальной составляющей, различными кинематографическими эффектами и колоритным нарративом.
Лично я перепрошёл несколько раз и меня всё ещё цепляет своим простым, прямолинейным, но мясным и готическо-разрушительным пафосом.
В соло я сложность ""Ангел Смерти"" не осилил, задушился на охране генератора от ксеносов, не мог их всех в одиночку контроллить на две фазы + моя 1060 передавала привет по фпс в тот момент, поэтому, проходил на сложности ниже (Высокая) (уже починили, там теперь лучше, но в соло всё ещё на этой сложности очень тяжко)
Персонажи в основном сюжете имеют заранее заготовленный набор навыков и прокачки в сюжете нет, только линейное повествование и кетчуп с варп-пылью на экране.
Боссы в сюжетной кампании сделаны интересно, с хорошими, не идеальными, но хорошими, механиками.
Хорошие локализации на различные языки, в том числе и Русский!

Режим PvE, они же Операции, представляют собой, на момент релиза, 6 миссий, на которые отправляются вторая и третьи отряды, косвенно участвующие в основном сюжете, направляемые лейтенантом Титом и капитаном Акераном. В этом режиме игрокам уже доступна система классов, прокачка классов, оружия, полноценная визуальная кастомизация персонажей.
Миссии представляют собой коридорные миссии на прохождения, в которых нам показываются как раз таки события от лица доп. отрядов, упоминаемых в сюжете.
Миссии построены по похожим формулам, как в World War Z, Warhammer Vermintide 1-2, Warhammer Darktide: коридорные миссии с ордами врагов, в случайных местах есть лут в виде припасов и аптечек, а в определенных иных местах или смежных с ними более ценный лут в виде геносемени, подбирая который и донеся персонажем до конца миссии НИ РАЗУ НЕ УМЕРЕВ, В ТОМ ЧИСЛЕ НЕ ВОЙТИ В НОКДАУН, весь отряд получит дополнительный опыт (где-то +20% от общего числа за миссию в выбранной сложности).
По мере возрастания сложности игра увеличивает врагам ПРОБИТИЕ и их ЖИЗНЕСПОСОБНОСТЬ, а также, добавляет увеличенный шанс появления мини-босса (Нейротроп, Карнифекс, Хеллбот) на любой арене, даже самой неудобной и в самые неподходящие моменты, но, за него вам дадут чертежи арсенала, необходимые для открытия вооружение следующего ТИРа для класса.(зеленый на ""минимальной"" и ""Средней"", на третьей сложности фиолетовый чертеж, а жельтый на самой последней).

В целом, жду новых миссий, нравится + нравится.

КАЖДАЯ СЛОЖНОСТЬ В ИГРЕ ПОДПИСАНА, ДЛЯ КАКОГО УРОВНЯ ПРОКАЧКИ КЛАССА ОНА ГОДИТСЯ! НЕ ХОДИТЕ НА СЛОЖНОСТИ ВЫШЕ СРЕДНЕЙ КЛАССАМИ НИЖЕ, ХОТЯ БЫ, 7 УРОВНЯ, ЛУЧШЕ 10+! ПЕРЕСТАНЬТЕ ПОРТИТЬ ИГРОВОЙ ОПЫТ СЕБЕ И ДРУГИМ, ПОЖАЛУЙСТА!


PvP в этой игре представлена в виде классического арена-шутера, но от третьего лица с системой классов из ""Операций"", только без прокачки. В PvP три режима, которые можно описать так:
- ""Уничтожение"" - Team Deathmatch самый стандартный.
- ""Захват"" - опорный пункт, появляющийся в определенном месте карты, который нужно удерживать. За удержание начисляются очки. Крабим очки до максимума - побеждаем, не даём точку врагам. Всё просто.
- Ну и обычных захват трёх фиксированных точек.
При смерти, игроки, спустя короткое время, ""пробуждаются"" для битвы вновь, да.
Режимы играются вполне себе интересно, но, к небольшому сожалению ,на данный момент в PvP есть некоторые вопросы с балансом оружия и классов, но, это дело поправимое.
В PvP присутствует полная визуальная кастомизация бойцов-лоялистов""Астартес"" и частичная (выбор заготовки) для предателей-""Астартес"" они же ""Хаос"".
Подлатать баланс оружия и классов, добавить режимы и карты и, полагаю, будет вполне годно, но, предполагаю, аудитория у PvP будет небольшая.


Игра представляет собой шутер от третьего лица, скрещенный со слешерной боевой системой ближнего боя с использованием ножа, силового меча, молота и цепного меча, каждый из которых имеет свои черты, своё применение, сильные и слабые стороны. В бою, помимо стрельбы и ""без врага в морду и фарш"" присутствует система уклонение, блока атак, парирования. В случае удачного парирования, игра даёт возможность нанести контратаку с использованием пистолета и нанести мощный удар ближнего боя, в случае же ""провала"" - игрок получает по своему здоровью и броне крайне неприятно большое количество урона, так сказать, наказание за ошибку.
По началу, подобная боевая система может показаться ""мешающей"" или ""неудобной"", но, ежели к ней приспособиться, так сказать, приучиться к правилам игры, то данная боевая система вполне рабочая и ею можно хорошо пользоваться в самых разных боевых ситуациях (стоит ещё учитывать и классы в PvE, т.к, например, ""Поддержка"" не имеет оружия ближнего боя).
Есть, конечно, в игре и не очень приятные геймплейные нюансы (привет кривые хитбоксы Карнифекса, например), а также не очень удобное информирование игрока, откуда на него ведётся нападение с дальнобольног овооружения (обстрел от ксеносов, например, в жестком бою очень тяжело увидеть, порою, откуда в тебя стреляют), но Alt+F4 ещё прожато не было, а я вполне себе легко подгораемый человек, ага


Моя 1060 ещё не откопытилась и фпс на средне-высоких адекватный, да и картинка красивая, лютых багов с раннего доступа (кроме стреляющих через стены врагов) замечено не было.
Есть только серверные проблемы с подключением, но они всё реже и реже, это поправимо, учитывая то, что в игре работает кроссплей с платформами не только консольными, но и площадками а-ля EGS.
Единственное, что несколько дискомфортно - порою долговатые загрузки на SSD. В этой игре они дольше, чем в любой другой, не Тарков на старых патчах, конечно, но такой нюанс имеется.
Ещё хотелось бы поддержку NIS (NVIDIA Image Scaling) в игре, т.к в других проектах для видеокарт, подобной моей, NIS показывает очень хорошие результаты как по фпс, так и по визуалу (FSR2 даже в нативном варианте размывает картинку, NIS оставляет её чёткой и контрастной, не убивая фпс).

A great sequel from Space Marine (2011), so many improvement on combat that make things more satisfying and most of time you find yourself surrounded with full of horde and make you thinking you wouldn't made it but you made it anyway. The main story is pretty simple just like the previous one honestly, but rather than just rush straight toward objective and with very clunky map design, at least in Space Marine 2 there is some improvement with world design that you can walk arround first and feel the atmosphere of Warhammer 40K universe. And let me tell you, the details on world design in this game is very impressive, I can just give this game 10/10 just for the world design it self. It's really have warhammer vibes, from the beginning toward the end, you can just randomly take a screenshot and it can be your new wallpaper.







+The world design is very impresive, you can tell the designer really appreciate the Warhammer 40K universe.
+So much improvement combat form Space Marine (2011) melee combat is much more satisfying now, and oh dont forget about melta gun, that gun is shredded everything.
+Your own companion brothers have their own motive and have some narative at least. it make your squad more alive and meaningful.
+They have PVP and PVE after your finish your campaign or when still in campaign. its really rare to see video games these day to have both PVP and PVE content.
+ Is not a live service game, but apparently the developers still have some plans for future updates.


- For the game that come from universe that have so much lore apparently the lore in this game is very little and simple. Just like Space marine 1 there is no much lore in the world that you have played, you see.. they have Dataslate sort of like BioShock audio diaries. But Dataslate in this game is really boring and not much added to main story or not make it the world more interesting. And to make it worse these Dataslate are very hidden. Im type of player who seeking the lore and check every corner of the map and yet im still missing some of dataslate. atleast in Bioshock you can see these diaries everywhere and so much interesting and have their own additional strories that make the world much alive.
- (PVP) Im playing pvp just Day 2 after release, and oh sweet terra have a mercy.... so many cheater with infinite grenade in pvp. the game itself have their own anticheat but it doesnt work i guess.

The continues story after the original Space Marine. Captain Titus had been imprisoned and tortured for a century, but eventually he was freed and allowed to return but no longer as a captain. The main story is quite short, simple and yet still interesting at least for me, especially if you Warhammer fans or have played Space Marine before. The main campaign is around 6-8 hours but im very much enjoyed it every minutes of it, im rather have 8 hours of full enjoyment rather than 20 hours of nothingness. Unlike the original Space Marine, when the story it just about Captain Titus at least in Space Marine 2 the stories is arround him and his chapters.



For the main campaign and the PVE i'd say is really good and satisfying. It really improve from everything you hoped for in the original Space Marine. The horde of tyranids swarmp you and you have really overpowered gun that can blast them and melt them. The bolt and plasma gun now is not useless anymore and can be good in battle. The melee attack like chainsaw and of course the warhammer (hehe) have satisfying animation when you used them. Many animation like dash is not clunky anymore. and if you are good at the game you can parry the attack of the enemies rather than dodge them.

Sadly the gameplay for pvp isnt for me. And dont get me wrong, the pvp is pretty good but even though if you are in top frag and can kill many enemies, still there is something is missing, it just like when you killed the enemies but it just feel empty. I dont know what is called but i just hoping pvp is more intense and have satisfying combat effect. i just hope is more like Tintanfall 2 multiplayer kinda thing when there is a bot (like guardsmen) to make it more interesting and alive.

I think the soundtrack are good but is not really memorable tbh. I dont quite remember which the soundtrack in Space Marine 2 that have special in my heart like 'The Only Thing They Fear Is You' from DOOM or 'Rory O'More / Saddle The Pony' from Bioshock Infinite, i guess none from Space Marine 2. But hey at least the sounds really capture in every scene and get the job done especially at the end.

Space Marine 2 has much improve from the original and the attention to the Warhammer 40K worlds and it details is really impresive. The combat it much satisfying and not feel clunky anymore. Is it worth it? well for the gold/ultra edition still debated since there is no much content for it prices, but for Standard Edition its very worth it especially if you are Warhammer 40k fans. Like people have said it before, 40K fans are super protective of the ip and demolish stuff they don’t like so the positive reception to the game says volumes.",2024/9/30,en

Ska3o4nuk,1,171.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086745517/,"Император защищает эту игру

Я не единожды натыкался в YouTube на мысли о том, что Россия - это Warhammer 40к. И правда, есть у нас что-то такое от Вахи, много пересечений. Эта игра лишь сильнее доказывает насколько россияне тонко чувствуют эту вселенную, ведь данную игру разрабатывали разработчики из Санкт-Петербурга и на данный момент - это самая успешная и лучшая игра по Warhammer 40к. А до этого другие российские разработчики сделали крутую RPG Warhammer 40к Rogue Trader. Россия умеет и могёт, когда ей это позволяют. Иронично, что Warhammer придумали британцы, а идеально понимают его именно россияне.

Чем же игра так хороша? А давайте разбираться.

1) Абсолютное отсутствие западной политической повестки, которая на генетическом уровне чужеродна для россиян, как для детей Императора чужды идеи ксеносов. Тут есть только Warhammer 40к в своём грязном и мрачном великолепии, никаких небинарных личностей, противных феминисток и никто не ругает Дональда Трампа. Да, в этой игре нам дают поиграть за команду из белого, чёрного и азиата, которые после прохождения игры становятся как родные. А так можно было? Конечно, надо просто персонажей прописывать и подавать так, чтобы людям они понравились. Вот так всё просто, как оказалось.

2) Превозмогание. Какая же эта игра сложная, она прям идеально этим передаёт дух вселенной. В игре есть кооп и он тут не для галочки добавлен, без него будет тяжело. Чтобы вы понимали, в игре есть дополнительные миссии за другой отряд космодесов, это PVE, которое заточено под кооп. Если вы попробуете поиграть без братишек с ботами, то даже на самой минимальной сложности готовьтесь превозмогать и сражаться на пределе своих возможностей, ибо тираниды и орден Тысячи Сынов будут вас в прямом смысле уничтожать. И это после патча, в котором сложность снизили, а ""режиссёру"", который как в Left4Dead генерит случайные стычки с врагами, снизили агрессивность. Мне страшно представить какой Ад творился на максимальной сложности до патча, наверное проще было Богов Хаоса победить, чем это пройти.

3) Визуал. Игра передаёт дух вселенной своим внешним видом. Огромные индустриальные постройки, нет, не так, ОГРОМНЫЕ индустриальные постройки. Пафос, нет, не так, ПАФОС. Смотришь на это всё и не хочешь ни за какие деньги оказаться там, что абсолютно правильно, ибо Warhammer 40к - это кошмар, в котором есть место только для страданий.

4) Ода милитаризму и братству. Игра идеально передаёт дух товарищества и ощущения себя частью чего-то необъятного, чем и является Империум. Если до этой игры ты не знал про Императора, то после игры слова ""Император защищает"" станут частью тебя. Игра передаёт понятие ""героизма"" на все 200%, тут самые настоящие солдаты, готовые отдать всего себя во имя своей расы. Кадианцы вообще красавчики, бегают такие маленькие под ногами космодесов, а храбрости у них не меньше чем у Ангелов Императора, у которых специально в мозгах отключают страх.

5) Геймплей. Это то самое классическое мясо из DOOM. Оружие делает ""бах-бах"", а враг превращается в фарш. А что ещё надо для счастья? Ты чувствуешь вес доспехов, то какие космодесы тяжёлые. А враги действительно ощущаются угрозой, ради которой Империум и стал таким жестоким, выстроив вертикаль власти и выкрутив идеологию милитаризма на максимум. С такими врагами быть ф*шистом не стыдно, а очень даже разумно.

6) Орды врагов. Я обожаю эту технологию, которая позволяет на экране сделать очень много врагов. Мы её могли до этого видеть в потрясающей дилогии игр A Plague Tale, где были полчища крыс. А тут вместо крыс у нас тираниды, которые в разы опаснее и крупнее. Это реально впечатляющее зрелище, с которым ещё и сражаться приходится.

7) Тит. Главный герой, он белый цисгендерный мужчина натурал, который не ничтожество какое-то, а действительно великий герой, который даже в условиях Империума остаётся хорошим человеком. Господи, я с этими западными играми уже и забыл, что так бывает. Тит ну очень крутой, он невосприимчив к воздействию варпа, а ещё он походу Святой, ибо с ним сам Император разговаривает.

우리, 울트라마린 2중대는 제국의 방산비리 조사를 통한 자정 노력이 성과를 거둔 점에 대해 경의를 표한다. 오직 황제와 인류제국의 영광을 위해 싸우는 우리 아스타르테스로서는, 이러한 결단을 통해 제국 수뇌부와 아드미니스트라툼, 뮤니토룸 내부의 타락과 부패의 뿌리가 뽑히기 시작했다는 소식을 반갑게 맞이한다.

이번 감사와 조정 이후, 방어구의 품질이 개선되었으며, 또한 전장에서 전투-형제들끼리 밀착하지 않으면 파워 아머의 보호막이 오작동하는 문제가 완벽히 해결되었음을 확인할 수 있었다. 이는 전장의 최전선에서 황제의 뜻을 구현하는 우리에게 꼭 필요했던 희망이자, 제국이 우리와 황제의 뜻을 저버리지 않았음을 증명하는 신호로 받아들인다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 아직 더 나아가야 할 길이 남아 있음을 우리는 인지하고 있다.

우리는 볼터에 사용할 볼트의 품질 역시 어느 정도 개선되었음을 확인할 수 있었으나, 여전히 우리 아스타르테스 맞닥뜨리는 적들, 특히 카오스와 이단, 그리고 외계의 사악한 존재들을 철저히 소탕하기에는 부족함이 느껴진다. 인류의 번영과 제국의 안정을 위한 성전에서, 볼터 무기가 좀더 임무에 적합한 품질과 위력을 갖추어야 할 필요가 있음을 다시금 강조한다. 플라스마 무기와 멜타 무기는 예전부터 지금까지 변함없이 훌륭했으나, 플라스마나 멜타 무기는 볼터만큼 범용성이 뛰어나지 않으며, 그런 무기들을 항상 사용할 수도 없다. 아스타르테스 화기 편제의 주역은 그 영광스러웠던 시대부터 지금에 이르기까지 언제나 볼터였음을 기억하기 바란다.

우리는 제국 수뇌부의 결단을 환영하며, 이번 감사에서 보여준 단호한 의지를 긍정적으로 평가한다. 이러한 자정 노력의 지속적 실행을 통해, 더 큰 부패를 사전에 막고, 제국이 우리와 황제께 대한 진실한 헌신을 다할 수 있으리라 믿는다. 우리는 제국이 앞으로도 현명하고 결단력 있는 판단을 내림으로써, 황제의 전사들이 자신의 임무를 완수하는 데 필요한 모든 준비를 갖출 수 있도록 노력해 주기를 고대한다.

우리는 언제나처럼 황제의 뜻을 받들어 인류의 수호자이자 정의의 심판자로서, 황제와 제국을 위해 싸울 것이다. 황제의 이름 아래 부패가 뿌리 뽑히고, 다시는 탐욕이 우리 스스로를, 인류와 그 위대한 제국을 흔들지 않도록, 우리는 황제의 충실한 종으로서 제국의 자정과 개선을 위한 노력에 언제나 동참할 준비가 되어 있다.

울트라마린 2중대의 이름으로, 신-황제 폐하의 뜻을 받들어, 위대한 인류의 뜻을 받들어 우리는 싸우리라. 황제 폐하와 인류 제국에 무궁한 영광이 있으라.",2024/10/19,ko

Oynanış kısmında yakın ve uzak dövüş mekanikleri dengeli tasarlanmış olsa da, bazen yakın dövüşe zorlanmak stratejik özgürlüğü kısıtlayabiliyor. Düşmanların hızları nedeniyle mesafe açmak zorlaştığında, istemeseniz bile kendinizi sürekli yakın dövüşte buluyorsunuz. Bu da farklı oynanış tarzlarını tercih edenler için sınırlayıcı olabilir.

İçerik açısından ise görev sayısının biraz sınırlı olduğunu söylemek mümkün. Daha fazla çeşitlilik ve görev eklenmesi oyunun uzun vadede tekrar oynanabilirliğini artıracaktır. Ayrıca, silah çeşitliliği de daha fazla olabilirdi, çünkü mevcut silahların bazıları birbirine oldukça benziyor. Yine de, oyun mevcut haliyle keyifli bir deneyim sunuyor ve ilerleyen güncellemelerle eksiklerin giderileceğini umuyorum.

But my partner is a Warhammer nerd who also has a bunch of friends who are into it as well. When they have their Warhammer playtime I call them the 40k cult.

Anyway my partner showed me the trailer of space marine II which didn't seem too bad, and it's co-op so I decided to give it a try. Space marine II is surprisingly good. I never thought I would actually enjoy something related to Warhammer.

Anyway I don't know if it's related to my AMD card but the game keep crashing. In one session about an hour into the game it crashed 4 times. I've updated everything related to AMD and followed some tips from people having the same issue as me but nothing worked. I mean if that doesn't show how determined I am. I don't know what does. I know they are releasing a patch end of September so hopefully whatever it's creating the crash issue will be fixed.

However, the most recent changes the studio implemented are not good for the direction or the longevity of the game. These new updates completely destroy a cohesive gaming experience by artificially making the game harder if you aren’t within 10 feet of your battle brothers. With so many dynamic ways to play this game, you cripple viable play styles and tactics by restricting how far away you can get from your teammates. The other changes that were implemented regarding ammo economy and parry windows are negligible in comparison. With the proximity armor recovery, your Snipers, Vanguards, and Assaults cannot be utilized effectively as their primary purpose is to single out and separate to focus on specific targets in the battlefield.

🐒Monke🐒,1,64.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MasqueicoMonke/,"Primeiro e antes de mais nada, talvez essa análise seja enviesada pelo simples fato de eu curtir o universo de W40K já tem bastante tempo, mas vamos lá pras perguntas mais simples (o que normalmente a pessoa quer saber quando vem ler ssasporcaria):

O jogo é bom? Sim.

O jogo tá pesado? Tá.

Vale a pena comprar? Se tu tá com o dinheiro e não vai gastar com coisas mais importantes, com certeza.

Tem bastante customização mesmo? Tem, só que eu achei de certa forma limitada em relação a algumas coisas (por exemplo querer pintar determinada parte da power armor mas não poder por que ficou bem ""generalizada"" a colorização), além, de é claro, terem colocado basicamente todas as customizações como ""compráveis"" com pontos que você ganha quando joga missões no modo de operations, outra coisa, um negócio que achei de certa forma ""paia"" foi o fato de que não vai dar pra pintar as armaduras de campeão dos capítulos (no caso só tem dos ultramarines até agora mas muito provavelmente vai valer pras que lançarem no futuro também).

Qual versão vale mais a pena pegar? Cara, depende de se tu curte a franquia ou não, a season pass que é dada na Gold será mais pra pegar novas customizações do que qualquer outra coisa, se for pegar a ultra só pegue se tu pensa que jogar com uma minigun (ou algum outro trabuco pesado) estilo o Heavy do TF2 é legal/divertido (A classe tá legal mas eu prefiro jogar full melee), EU recomendaria pegar a standard se caso tu não for alguém que já curta o universo/temática de W40K.

Dá pra jogar solo ou é obrigatório ter amigo pra jogar junto? Bicho, dá pra jogar solo, o bot é meio burro mas ele ajuda. O jogo pra jogar com os amigos é muito bom, e, se caso você quiser jogar o modo ""Operations"" que é o modo PvE do jogo (fora a campanha), o matchmaking é bem rápido, sem contar também que tem o modo PvP que tem bastante gente jogando no momento.

Tem bastante variedade de arma? Mais ou menos. Atualmente existem as ""figurinhas carimbadas"" da franquia, algumas delas ficam meio que de escanteio por existirem armas mais fortes (meio que não são tão balanceadas), no futuro, pelo que falaram e pelo roadmap, serão adicionadas novas armas, então, é só aguardar.

A campanha é muito longa? Cara, pelo que eu vi, não tanto, é papo de 20 horas ao que parece (isso com você tomando seu tempo e jogando na calma), apesar disso, pelo que joguei, curti o rumo da história e a progressão. O que vai dar longevidade ao jogo é mais o modo PvE e o PvP.


(Só um adendo, como falei, o jogo tá bem pesado, além disso, aparentemente tem alguns bugs como por exemplo inimigos invisíveis e/ou o seu personagem também invisível, pessoalmente não presenciei nenhum bug até agora, jogo tá rodando de boas (apesar que meu PC tá uma porqueira pra rodar o jogo))

Визуал и оптимизация - моё почтение, очень красивая игра. Фирменный пафос ощущается буквально во всём.
Добивания врагов сочные, плюс их довольно много, что радует.
К лору W40k на мой взгляд, тоже отнеслись с уважением - приятно видеть отсылки и знакомые детали.

Но не всё так радужно, как кажется на первый взгляд, поэтому если вы не фанат ""Вахи"" обратите внимание на следующие недостатки игры на данный момент:

- Отсутствие контента. Я брал предзаказ и отдал за игру 4.5к. На мой взгляд,таких денег игра не стоит. Подождите, пока она наполнится, либо берите по скидке.
- Ужасный сетевой код. Играл с друзьями, были частые разрывы, долгие загрузки и невозможность подключения к сети. Слышал, что у всех игр Saber наблюдались подобные проблемы, надеюсь исправят.
- PvP режим скучноват, а-ля, ""как в нулевых"", ""чтобы был"" - зайдёт далеко не всем.

好了，打完剧情进行动模式才意识到那些幽默爆弹枪全部都是用来搞笑的原P玩具，整个游戏就两把枪能用，分别是热熔和多管热熔，而不能带热熔的原P全部都被溺死在了巢都下水道的屎水里，这就是原P武器库给我的自信，基利曼！哆啦考尔！我的弹药在哪里？！我爆燃枪呢？我重力炮呢？
但是最戳中我笑点的还属那直接照抄暗潮的技能树，怎么连牢兵的幽默蚊子腿增伤光环都抄过来了？但是隔壁四个贼配军面对尸潮无伤遨游打完血回满了还刷了一身的手雷，而这边三个原P刷波刀虫配武士那可是直接汗流浃背了，面对唐突刷脸上的红字战士猎马人小队搭配杀妈圣甲虫终结者甚至直接翻滚连打屋檐化身马拉松批宠爱切到冒烟嘻嘻嘻我要活下去，在grim dark的第41千年there is only 踹哈。
说个笑话：“死亡即为我的技能”（他真是这样说的）
再稍微一算为了这套幽默技能树和武器养成系统要把首发的这仅仅六张图肝多少遍以此得到从木棍打龙虾升级成+11暗金濡意金箍棒打誓约的嗜血狂暴龙虾王的史诗级游戏体验提升之后我终于还是绷不住笑成了个傻逼。
作为一个想要长线运营的游戏，堆料是必须的，而他的战役部分堆料勉强能够算是合格，而作为游戏核心的合作模式和已经被风灵月影战团给主宰的对战模式来说，他是不合格的，现阶段的料实在是太少太少了，只希望在长线运营上不要致敬传奇运营超级地球。

更新：
终于太空超雄人也迎来了自己的自由升级，喜提难度5，敌人强度和波次频率超级增强，特种单位更是一个接一个出，我何德何能让虫巢意志拍下来3个利卡特戳我？当年去炫狼崽子的种的时候但凡上这一半的心你虫能混成现在这dio样？更可怕的是这版本下脑虫的攻击欲望就和打了群勃龙加雌二醇的常熟战帅一样乳液更是狂飙。
CSM更是重量级，看到屏幕上出现一波敌人的下一秒拐角走出来两个圣甲虫终结者加一个巫师与此同时背后刷出来了三个红字战士我就直接鼠标一丢等死了。
除了明砍回击系近战判定之外，还暗砍了翻滚的距离和无敌时间，最让我觉得莫名其妙的改动是他把毒液炮的瞄准蓄力时间给随机化了，从以前可以按照时间预判来翻滚变成了只能盯着那条瞄准线激情目押，按歪来就瞬间失去半条血，真实还原面对现代桑吉尔夫而你是个只能搓升龙的脆皮的游戏体验。
这也就算了，加了一个从暗潮抄过来的兄弟情系统，战斗兄弟必须互相靠近才能回甲！而我翻遍了10版codex没看到哪里有写超雄战士身边没有战斗兄弟的时候就不能过甲保，上面只写了军刀的妈已经永远地迷失在了亚空间。你作为一个牢锤，你看到一群怪朝你扑过来你能忍住不跳起来砸地板的话你定力已经超越90%的青春期体育生了，而在这个难度5，你一个人飞出去的意思就是你会变成个不能回甲的废物，好吧，抛开牢锤这个废物职业不谈，如果你的队友是个需要站在后排获得射击视野或者避免队友挡炮的狙击/电浆特战的话也会遇到同样的问题，而先锋更是每次接敌都要做出抉择：是我一个人跳出去切掉后排的吞噬枪和毒液炮让自己和队友都不能回盾，还是保持战线被随机抽奖的毒液炮射爆？
超雄战士的人生抉择：在面对能够如同人生头一次看AV的青春期体育生一样能射的新版本双脑虫的AOE弹幕攻击的情况下，我到底是扎堆找机会杂兵回甲还是散开各凭本事？

All I know for certain is this: I am mere days from the system's edge, and within a solar week, I will be in the skies above Terra.

With me I bring the entire might of the Thirteenth Legion, and I am not alone; word has reached me from Russ and the Lion, at the vanguard of the Sixth and the First. Our numbers are enough to cleanse the heavens and tear the world from the Arch-traitor's grip.

Hold on to hope, brother. That is all I ask. Can you give me that? Can you stand your ground for these last, ultimate hours? Those elusive twins, Victory and Vengeance, are coming. This war ends the moment I reach Terra.

Space Marine 2 has a great potential and may become extremely popular co-op game. It's extremely fun to play this game in co-op. My wife also liked this game, I was really happy to play SM2 with her.

Story is good, combat feels amazing, world (level design) looks really cool and impressive, co-op is awesome (I was playing in team of 2 friends), boss fights are kinda challenging and enjoyable, graphics and performance is really good for my GeForce GTX 1070 video card, I have no problems at all. PvE aspect of this game is good, all 6 classes are more or less cool to play.

Waiting for some meaningful DLCs like new enemies (necrons, orks...) and biomes(lava world, ice world, ocean world (perhaps, it may be some giant ocean facility or something) for PvE and not just new skins.

P.S.: Would be cool to see Sisters of Battle/Adepta Sororitas as playable faction with separate campaign as DLC at some point (side story + co-op multiplayer stuff).",2024/9/8,en
†:MΔЯ▼:†,1,67.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978923182/,"Allright.

I am into warhammer for well over 20 years. I own basicly every 40k game there is from psp Squad Command to Chaos Gate for windows 95. I am an absolute Fanboi, there is no way to call it otherwise. I am a true nerd on that subject. Read the Books, watched the Films/Shows (Yes, the 80s VHS Movies and Warhammer+ Content). I own several Armies and collect the various army books since 2nd Edition.

With that out of the Way I can truly say, this game is a loveletter from the Developers to the Hardcore Fanbois. And I hereby and with my Purchase thank them for this absolutely Gorgeous game.

The 40k IP has been treated mixed. We had some great Games like Battlefleet Gothic, Dawn of War 1-2(not 3 though), some mediocre Stuff like Mechanicus (The OST is fire though), Rogue Trader and alot of Terrible Games. (Dawn of War 3, Storm of Vengance, The Mobile Games, Eternal War).

I am a Gamer for most of my life. Burnt my fingers on more Games I was exited about then I care to admit. I was very cautios with this one. I really hoped it would be atleast ""ok´ish"" and was very sceptical when I saw that ""Play 4 days Earlier for 40€"" nonsense. But boy, this game restored a bit of my Faith in the Gaming Industry.

Over the course of the last 10-15 years I watched a noticeable decline. For me, personaly, AAA was utter trash with a 60-80€ Price Tag. Indie Games where the stuff to go for and I havent Bought Anything from any ""Big Publisher"" for over 10 Years (Allright, with the exception of Anno 1800 and I regret that, but that does not belong here).

This Game is exactly what was modern Gaming was Missing. Its a Joyride, feature complete game on day 1. Not one of those games, and you know wich one I mean, wich turn into Games as a Service or thats actually ""Finished"" 2-3 Years AFTER release.

Hell, even if you´re not a total 40k nut like me, this game will blast you Away. The Story/Singleplayer Campaign is a 8-12 Hours long, 90s testoterone filled action Movie. Filled with a world to dive in, a world that engages you and makes you Forget your Job and all your Problems in Life. Its a Rollercoaster Ride you will remember in the Years to come.

The Game is full of Content. While most Publishers would´ve went the Lazy way and Recycle the Singleplayer for the Coop experience, this game offers a whole new set of Missions bound into the Story. That says alot. Ubisoft would´ve sold this as a several Game.

By the dark Gods, everytime I thought they hit the climax, they pushed it from 10/10 to 11/10 and in the End even to 12/10. I am glad Games like this still are made.

My Heretic heart jumps with Joy.

This game gets a Clear recommendation from me.

First of all I LOVE THIS GAME

BUTT

It has high highs and very low lows

----------WHAT I LOVE AND WOULD KISS THE DEVELOPERS FOR -------------------------------

1. World building ( I never knew what a battlebarge interior looked like and am trying to recreate one in another game so this helps a lot ) ( the little room of a marine )

2. Graphics

3. Space marine lines, interactions, roasts, voice actors - chefs kiss

4. The random interactions on the ship ( Relationship between serfs, marines, techpriests and servitors )
As a side-note, there was an interaction where a servitor reported severe spine injury and that did describe the horror of a servitor)

5. Gaunts dying from the psychic blast when a warrior dies is PERFECTION.

6. Marine movement, weapon sounds, all great

7. The way you can find random areas with weapons or dataslates.

8. Fisting flowers ( Imperial fist reference?)



----------What I hate, dislike, am confused about ( I may be wrong, I accept that, so feel free to discuss with me on this)

1. The armor colors on the customization menu are POOP. Mostly. A lot of colors are missing and some are completely different from the GW colors with the same name. Was it hard to sample bucket those colors from the GW website? AND WHY ARE THERE SO FEW?

2. The eliminator sniper seems way to weak compared to the tabletop

3. The pyroblaster flame looks terrible, range way to short

4. If a unit makes a special attack you cant react with a grenade or some other things, Titus stays there like a brain damaged guardsmen.

5. The way they made the tyrannid rippers is terrible. They are just floating 3D models that are not actually there like the rest of the units and for some reason are not affected by the psychic blast when a warrior dies.

6. The leman russes I saw never move their sponson weapons or USE THEM.

7. The game loads so slow I can take a nap in the meantime.

8. I had a heavy bolter with some rounds left, then I started fighting the LICTOR and I no longer had the weapon, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I was using that.

9. The cutscenes are premade and it does not matter what loadout you selected, it always shows one weapon. A BIT LAZY

10. The enemy variety seems poor, when you see how many units tyrannids actually have. Many of them could be bosses. ( I write this not having finished the game yet so I may eat my words later on)



----------What I wanted but did not get, maybe for now --------------------

1. Letting me play the campaign with custom colors and armor. LET ME PRETEND I AM FIGHTING WITH MY HOMEBREW ARMY. PLEASE!!!

2. Did not see a way to apply custom chapter badges ( homebrew reasons as well )


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- NEW REVIEW AFTER I FINISHED THE MAIN CAMPAIGN --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

WHAT I AM MOST DISAPPOINTED

1. The campaign is way too short, took me 2 days to finish

2. The tyrannid enemies and variety is VERY LACKING
WHAT YOU GET - Rippers, Gaunts, Warriors, Lictor, Carnifexes, spore mines, Harpy, Raveners, Zoanthropes

WHAT YOU DID NOT GET - Bio-Titans, Genestealer, Hive guards, Mawlock, Pyrovores or Biovores, Tervigones, Tyranofexes, Venomthropes

3. Sometimes the guard units just stop and wait for the player to move to the next area, like in poor designed games when the animation just finishes and nothing more happens ( more specifically the bridge section )

4. Random lore aspects that don't make sense like the tyrannids collecting corpses but there are no reclamation pools or tendrils OR having both first-born vehicle models and primaris models

5. Forcing me to use certain weapons in the latest boss battles, when I was saving some special weapons.

6. Like I said before, Leman Russ tanks not shooting their side weapons at all.

7 . The guardsmen depiction is kinda ♥♥♥♥ in regards to their equipment ( they never use mortars, heavy weapons, sentinels, hellhounds, special weapons AT ALL) ( NOT EVEN A BASILISK BOMBARDMENT )

8. No mission with a usable vehicle, just teases us ( at least implement one with an invictor suit )

9. Most of the game is filled with massive teases ( seeing a baneblade stationary BUT NEVER AFTERWARDS, NEVER IN COMBAT) ( a helldrake that suddenly becomes irrelevant )

10. The fact that I have to unlock colors that are WAY TO FEW and INNACURATE

11. The price of the game when you take into consideration all of its negative aspects


The whole game feels like a cash grab, but with some effort put into it because there are still many pozitive aspects.

If with the next patches they change some things I WILL CHANGE THE REVIEW.

I am just disappointed.",2024/9/8,en

ゲームシステム特にPvEモード中心にレビュー書いていきます。
※ちょっとネタバレあり

総評
シリーズファンや臨場感と世界観を楽しみたい方、昨今のシューターにありがちなチャラチャラしたキャラクターにうんざりな方、ソウル系シューター好きにはオススメできるかもしれない。
ホードシューターだと思って買うと後悔するしお勧めしない。少なくとも自分には合わなかった。
ホードシューターとソウル系、ハント系を無理やりくっつけたような印象を持ったが、ホードシューターとしては上位の敵が硬すぎるしソウル系、ハント系としても雑魚敵が多すぎる。

いいと思う点
1:アーマーのカスタマイズが結構しっかりとできる(キャラクター自身は役割に応じたむさいおっさんで固定、でもそこがいい)
2:しっかりと固められた世界観からくる臨場感
3:ひるんだ敵をずたずたに引き裂く爽快なフィニッシャーが連発できる

自分には合わないと思った点
ゲーム全体編
1:ホードシューターと見せかけたソウルライクで頭空っぽにしているとすぐやられる
2:動きがもっさりしている(ある程度は重厚感があっていいと思うがちょっとやりすぎ、大群相手ではストレス)
3:中から上位の敵に隙が無いか少ない、某モンスターを狩るゲームのように1vs狩人とかならそれでもいいかもしれないが大量の雑魚敵と四方八方からの遠距離攻撃がある中では情報過多でキツイ
4:こちらの銃は豆鉄砲ばかりなのに敵は撃ちまくってくる上に空まで飛ぶ、シンプルにつまらない
5:大群に襲われるのに大群相手に向いている武器が少ない、頑張ってレベルを上げると弾丸の貫通力を強化できるものもあるようだが、自分はそこまでやろうとは思えなかった
6:このレビューを書いている時点ではアーマーがもろ過ぎる上に体力を回復する手段が制限されすぎていると感じる、個人的にはもっと気軽に楽しめるゲームが好きなので自分には合わなかった

ターミニッド
1:中から上位の敵が硬すぎる上こちらの銃の威力が微妙でスポンジを撃っているような感覚、爽快感は全くない
2:上位の敵の浮いているやつが隙が無く、体力がやたらと多く、バリアを張り、遠距離攻撃を撃ちまくってくる
3:下位の敵は周囲の中位の敵をすべて倒すと勝手に倒れるが、肝心の中位の敵がバレットスポンジな上に結構集団で出てくる

カオス
1:中位の敵が硬い上に銃で撃ってもひるまず、殴ってもすぐテレポートで逃げ、敵の方は無限に四方八方から撃ってくる。はっきり言ってクソ
2:下位の敵の中に盾持ちがいてなかなかの人数で頻繁に湧いてくる。クソ
3:上位の人型遠距離タイプがひるまないうえに無限に高火力ブッパしてくる。クソ
4:色が気に入らない。クソ
5:カオスはクソ",2024/9/16,ja
Legendz-Senpai⚜,1,71.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Legendz_Senpai/,"I can confirm that Space Marine 2 is probably the best game in the Warhammer 40k universe ever released so far, especially in 3-player co-op, it's enjoyable and awesome.
the game is really beautiful graphically, the scenario is solid and respects the universe of warhammer 40k very well if you like the universe you will really be served. There is a pretty crazy attention to detail in the game the number of enemies that are displayed by combat is really impressive the same for the enemy and allied units in the distance that you can kill there are many different ways to play the game even if in the end it remains the same thing you have a lot of weapons in melee and at a distance. The animations are so enjoyable the cinematics are really magnificent worthy of a movie. The modus operandi is really nice and allows you to play with your own squad at the same time as the main missions of the campaign (always with 3) which allows you to explore the actions during the campaign a little more. And if you are interested in multiplayer for the moment it is really very nice worthy of the first opus of space marine and the future content that the studio plans to put really gives me good hope (new pve mission, pvp mod, horde mode, new weapons etc ...) In short to be honest I never buy games in advance and even less at 80 € to play them in advance but I must say that I am so impressed by the qualities of the game that I recommend you to play it even if you are not a hardcore fan of warhammer.

OliveWizard,1,39.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/olivewizard/,"В ходе размышлений о лучших играх 2024 года мне в голову приходят два варианта: Helldivers 2 и Space Marine 2. И там, и там суперсолдаты будущего истребляют гигантских жуков из далёкого космоса, но Sony опять подтвердила звание «конторы», поэтому сегодня я пишу лишь о Space Marine 2 как об игре года.

Игра старомодна. Она сделана по формуле из нулевых: каждый уважающий себя блокбастер должен иметь кампанию часов на десять, мультиплеер и кооператив. Но именно потому, что сейчас таких игр не делают, она ощущается глотком свежего воздуха. Ещё и не имела даже на старте проблем с багами и техническим состоянием.

выветривается из головы сразу после прохождения, но я точно помню, что проходил её буквально с открытым ртом. Это самый достоверный на данный момент Warhammer. Знакомые по книгам сооружения планетарного масштаба и бесчисленные орды врагов здесь есть и сделаны они с максимальным масштабом и детализацией. Поэтому мой космодесантник долгое время не бежал навстречу целям миссий, а кропотливо изучал каждый метр ульев.

явно не создавался как основной режим. Но подобно старым частям Call of Duty позволяет просто весело побегать-пострелять. Короткие матчи, маленькие карты, мгновенные возрождения, забавные фразочки, награды за каждое действие. Старая добрая классика времен игр в джевеле за сотку.

заставит попотеть. Путь к максимальному 25 уровню представляет тяжёлый подъём к вершине. Ты получаешь по лицу, поднимаешься, поднимаешь уровни оружия и класса, учишься играть и начинаешь чувствовать себя увереннее на этом уровне сложности. Потом переходишь на следующий уровень и… уже в самом начале миссии игра ставит тебя на место. Ты снова никто, иди учись играть. Рано или поздно ты доходишь до последнего, пятого уровня сложности, который станет сложнейшим испытанием твоих навыков. Может быть ты так и не осилишь его, но к тому времени хотя бы прокачаешь оружие и навыки.
А потом оказывается, что ты прокачал только один класс и один комплект оружия. Все остальные нужно качать точно так же с нуля. А в игре только 6 (после обновления 7) миссий. Проходить их нужно раз за разом. Знаете, что такое безумие? В этом режиме слишком медленная прогрессия.

В общем, я рекомендую попробовать Space Marine 2 даже тем, кто не является фанатом вселенной Warhammer 40 000. Она красивая, необычная, бросает вызов и награждает за его преодоление. К тому же это игра от «наших» разработчиков. Такие выходят нечасто, но всегда радуют. Если это не Смута, лол (но её и игрой сложно назвать).
Разве что цена в 3200 слишком высока. Игре бы подошел рекомендуемый Valve эквивалент 60 долларов - 1900 рублей.",2024/11/30,ru

Bei dem PVP Modus ist dies nicht so schlimm doch bei PVE geht die Lust leider nach den 6 Missionen schnell raus. Server Probleme gab es jedoch nicht viele. Einige haben Grafikprobleme und sehen unsichtbare Charaktere wo aber dran gearbeitet wird. Ich persönlich hätte mir gewünscht das man seinen Space Marine individueller gestalten kann z.B. das man Namen, Stimme und Gesicht ändern kann.

Der Rest an dem Spiel ist sehr positiv. Das Kampfsystem macht jedes mal Bock und auf die Grafik wäre sogar der Imperator stolz da sie sogar sehr flüssig läuft. Interface und Audio wirken sehr gut überarbeitet und besonders die deutsche syncro kann sich durch aus hören lassen. Das absolute Highlight ist meiner Meinung nach die Kampagne. An der kann ich absolut nichts kritisieren da sie viel Spaß macht und die Inszenierung mehr als gut gelungen ist.

Дальний бой в игре ощущается кастрированным. Ближний бой гораздо практичнее, но при этом импакта от него почти никакого. Астартес будто палкой машут.

Дизайн конечно ебёт, но сильно расстроило, что опять в игре по вселенной появляется именно ересь Тризнча. В конце прошлого года уже выходила великолепная Rogue Trader, в которой тоже в основном были демоны Тзинча в основной сюжетке. Хочется в крупных играх посмотреть и на других хаоситов.

В целом я уверен, что эти разработчики еще наполнят игру множеством контента. И если игра будет интересна людям, будут её поддерживать несколько лет. Но на выходе для игры за 5к деревянных ну слишком слабо и пусто. Тот же Rogue Trader на релизе хоть и имел множество багов и сильные перекосы в балансе, но зато контента в нём было на 100+ часов. Да и стоил он сильно дешевле. Дальнобойное оружие все одинаковое по ощущениям, пользоваться чем то кроме тяжелых болтеров и мельты в целом и не хочется. Видов противников тоже крайне мало - 5 у тиранидов и 4 у хаоситов. Миссий мало, задачи на миссиях сводятся к нажиманию кнопочек на терминалах.

Еще показалось, что игре нехватает саундтрека. Не запомнилось ни одного трека, играющего на фоне. Как будто специально старались написать музыку, которая будет слегка и максимально ненавязчего приседать на ухо в момент перебежек по локациям. Но это же ваха, тут должны быть эпические оркестровые композиции. Как было в том же Rogue Trader, к слову.

С техническими проблемами не столкнулся вообще, один раз только из 20-30 сессий в операциях словил дисконнект, но больше было похоже на локальную проблему с сетью.

Если думаете покупать, но сомневаетесь - лучше подождите полгода-год. Тогда может и контента завезут, и скидки подрубят. На релизе нормально себя развлечь смогут только совсем отбитые фанаты вселенной.

DanWardog,1,141.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994343052/,"The style of the game is on point with satisfying gameplay, but it has some GLARING issues. I'd recommend it, but I hope it gets some polish soon!

Pros:
Style: The feel of the 40k universe is really hit on the head. This alone has probably gotten me through the game. I just really adore it.
Audio: Crunchy sound design is very satisfying.
Weapons: The gear you use feels pretty good, the design is limited, but it's loyal to the universe.
Gameplay: Fairly rhythmic fighting with parries, counters & dodges.
Big enemies: Boss fights can be tough ( Angel of Death difficulty ), but typically manageable ( caveat below ).
Story: The story is a bit shallow, but good enough.

Cons:
The most glaring issue is ally AI. It's horrendous, pathetically bad. This can make some boss fights an absolute slog when you're trying to balance yourself to proceed through the fight. It also destroys immersion seeing an Astartes knuckle f***ing himself in the corner while you're fighting for your life.
Hit boxes: The hit boxes are bad. You'll get hit at bizarre ranges & you'll often shoot invisible walls when attacking enemies. I've also been struck countless times through cover from ranged attacks.
Homing Melee Attacks: One the most annoying things in this game is enemies leaping at you ( not talking about parry counters ) & having them turn in the air or have them YA YEET themselves after you when you dodge.
Stun Lock: Though I understand it's a swarm hitting you & that's sort of the point, getting stun locked is just a poor choice. No one likes stun lock. No one likes losing control of their character. No one wants to have 2/3 of their health gone from 3 gaunts.

Edit:

Tacked on Feature: After finally playing the PvP I gotta' say it's pretty dog-sh*t. The fact that you have to re-level up just to use weapons is a very brain-dead decision. It's artificial play time that should not exist in a game where PvP feels like a tack-on to begin with. Being dumped into games where the majority of my team is > Level 10 & the opponents are < Level 20 is laughable. Less options, less-powerful gear ( in some aspects ) & less experience vs a team higher in all regards. Trashy.",2024/9/10,en

Internet ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ Hero,1,169.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MeuwMeuwich/,"Неплохая игра с сюжетной кампанией, которая не успевает надоесть.

Плюсы:

Отличная графика и дизайн, люди работавшие над окружением, оружием и бронёй - большие молодцы,ehe

Хорошие анимации оружия ближнего и дальнего боя, персонажей и боссов (особенно в кампании).

Сюжетная кампания была ОК, но общая тональность происходящего не ощущалась серьезно или мрачно.

Кооп хороший, все кроме скверного баланса меня радует. Особенно порадовала недавно добавленная 7 миссия.

PVP не трогал, но его наличие в качестве дополнительного контента тоже радует.

Минусы:

Тупиковый баланс сложности - мы просто сделает мобов на 400% жирнее.
Подавляющее часть оружия дальнего боя стреляет горохом вне зависимости от уровня редкости. Человек, который решил, что болтганы должно наносить мизерный урон, иметь огромный разброс и еще сверху накинуть ограниченный боезапас - ты нормальный? Урон оружия ближнего боя по элитным врагам тоже вызывает вопросы, хотя 10 ударов по одному (не мини-боссу) врагу не так раздражает как 30 выстрелов в голову до состояния добивания, что очень сильно вредит ощущению от стрельбы.

Ужасное микширование звука - сами звуки неплохие, но из-за микширования в них отсутствует импакт и ""сочность"".

Отстойный саундтрек, который уступает даже первой части. Особенно это касается музыки во время боя, когда играет какое-то напёрдывание или удары молоточков зацикленные по 10 раз. Заглавная тема - просто дженерик без харизмы, который не ужасен, но и забывается сразу после нажатия ""начать игру"". Эмбиент на Боевой Барже ""ОК"", но не более.

I want to like this game, but I can't recommend it when the first game is better in every way. Saber Interactive clearly has some big fans of the franchise in their midst, but the gameplay needs a lot more time in the oven.

Visually, the game is stunning. If you're a lore enjoyer, you're in for a good time.

The gameplay is passable to bad in the best of times. They attempt to wow you with some cool swarming tech, but once the novelty wears off, you're left with a lot to be desired.

Gunplay is bland and simple while Melee is clunky and unpolished. Hitting enemies feels like hitting a sponge. Dodge and Parry prompts aren't responsive and sometimes simply wont do anything at all. You'll take 3/4 of your health in damage for failing a prompt. Better hope someone on your team is killing the ranged enemies or that failed prompt will end with you dying while your character tries to stand up.

When an enemy's health gets low enough, they're stunned and prompt you to run over and Execute them with a special animation. When executed, you'll restore armor (not health). This would be great if smaller enemies didn't die in one hit, preventing you from executing them for armor. Don't forget that you're getting hit for a majority of your health, so, good luck! Sometimes it feels like it's is more efficient to recover health/armor by dying and letting your AI companions resurrect you. The overall flow of battle feels terrible when you're supposed to be a walking tank.

If you want to feel like a Space Marine, play the first game again.",2024/9/7,en

甚至完全不如暗潮爽。
有几个非常大的问题希望你们9号游玩前知道。
1.枪反无法打断指令，而且不完全无敌，高难度下高血精英无法直接接处决，所以还是推荐近战处决。
2.奸奇在有些图是有bug的，上个场景（上个阶段）中未击杀的巫师会跨图复活千子，导致游戏几乎无法进行。
3.格挡有两段，二段是一个推击，但是推击是没有格挡的，以及格挡本身性能不强，无法支持混潮或者复数精英时的情况。
4.指令除了能被处决和格挡打断外，翻滚无法打断，也就是说你要翻滚必须结束上一次动作。导致雷霆锤这样动作帧很大的武器受苦。
5.这游戏目前没有奶妈，战斗回血比较严苛，有以下三种情况，一是盾卫在你旁边开大你立即接处决，二是守护道路复活后立即接处决，三是受伤后虚血立即处决。所以满盾该放给队友处就给队友。
6.高难远程生存能力不足，很难在清周围杂和处理精英得到平衡。目前两个主远程都有问题，主要体现在处理精英过慢，和没有队友很难处理利卡特和蛇虫。
7.机制方面，盾的作用其实是衔接，有盾-清杂/打伤-没盾-处决循环 保持战斗节奏用的，但一旦被远程近战黏上盾分钟没有的。

cello523,0,208.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048106189/,"Love this game, but the latest patch has significantly lessened the enjoyment for me.

Specifically, the latest mechanic that requires your character to be in close proximity to your teammates in order to both regenerate armor (after ~25s of taking no damage) or regain armor through combat (parries/gun strikes/executions), absolutely needs to be adjusted or removed entirely.

This mechanic is currently broken (or at least I hope it is not intended to be this way) when you are the last survivor in your squad. The game does not allow you to regenerate armor, PERIOD. Good luck trying to survive an enemy wave on Lethal difficulty for 300s as you wait for team to re-spawn. It should be turned off when you are the sole survivor.

I swear the distance required to be considered within range of your squad is shorter than the distance I can throw a Melta Bomb. It also seems like the 25s armor regeneration timer resets if you happen to step out of that range. This can cause you to be without armor for what seems like minutes at a time, even if there is no enemies around. You can only pray your brothers don't just run off while your back is turned to them because you're Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palming a massive Tyranid wave trying to survive.

Sniper gameplay is significantly impacted by this change. It's hard to gain line-of-sight of ranged enemies or maintain safe positioning away from enemies when you're required to be within spitting distance of your team.",2024/10/22,en

Stefan_Melchiott,1,81.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolf_Ratnik/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - натурально, одна из лучших игр 2024 года.
Сразу стоит отметить, что я не ярый фанат, играл буквально в пару игр по вселенной, когда-то пытался разобраться в настолке, но бросил. В первую очередь я заинтересовался проектом, как АА-игрой от своих земляков.
Проходил Space Marine 2 в соло, изначально были планы поиграть с друзьями, но не срослось и сразу отмечу, что играть без кооператива ничуть не сложно даже на высоких сложностях, поэтому, если кто-то вам рассказывает о необходимости играть с компанией друзей - это необязательно.
Ещё важно отметить отличнейшую оптимизацию (на фоне других тайтлов 24 года, игра выглядит великолепно, но при этом требует куда меньше ресурсов).
Сюжет охватывает продолжение истории ультрамарина Тита, который вернулся из Караула Смерти и принялся за новые задания (советую первую часть пройти, чтобы полностью погрузиться в игру). А далее мы просто следуем указаниям командования, выполняем задания и по итогу прошлое нашего героя смешивается с настоящим, что выстраивается в новую эпичную историю.
Геймплейно игра охренительная, Очень сбалансирована сделана боевая система, где необходимо пользоваться не только огнестрелом, но и холодным оружием. Игра заставляет всегда находиться на средней дистанции, не уходить далеко от врага, но и не врываться в самый эпик. Есть множество миссий, которые приносят абсолютно новый опыт, какие-то интересные механики.
Помимо сюжетных миссий есть дополнительные задания, которые охватывают события, что происходили на фоне в главном сюжете. Здесь уже появляется прокачка, разные классы, что добавляет игре интереса. В дальнейшем разработчики обещают добавлять всё новые и новые миссии.
Мультиплеер отличный, в кои-то веки нам не надо бесконечно качать какие-то пушки, выбивать какие-то ранги. сетевая игра просто дарит веселые эмоции, чего давненько не хватало в современных играх.

Однозначно советую игру, как соло, так и командным игрокам, вы весело проведёте время.

One of the most cinematic game stories I've experienced in a while! It's about 8-10 hours long, but it was fantastic!!! 
While I loved it, there are a few points I'd like to note.

A CHECKLIST

-----------------------------------------
✔️ Playable on GeForceNOW. Thank you developers!
✔️ An amazing campaign! While short and simple, it was full of action, an intriguing story and interesting characters!
✔️ Really impressive art design, brought to life in a lore-accurate direction. The brutality and bleakness of W40K are masterfully conveyed.
✔️ A simple, yet well-written storyline with plausible characters and interesting turn of events.
✔️ It gives you the feeling of a ""classic"" game. It's reminiscent of something we've lost in this oversaturated game market, but this game brings it back.
✔️ I don't know how it was for other people, but the game ran great for me. I didn't need to fine-tune any settings, and it was a great experience!
✔️ The game's universe has an incredibly passionate community around it! This will make you want to be a part of it and stick around.
✔️ The game was made to be played in co-op (I, however, played it solo). After finishing the campaign, you can do missions over and over in 3 game modes, with a progression system.
➖ While overall fun, I'm not always a huge fan of the combat. This game's combat feels like a combination of Doom and the Batman series' combat style, but needs finer tuning.
➖ It's not an open-world game, but that's not a bad thing. It's accessible for anyone to pick up and try, and it won't waste your time.
➖ Not a lot of content; however, I can say that the content that is there at the moment is good enough for you to pick this title up and give it a try.
➖ Not really a high variety of enemies, but then again, the game was less than 10 hours long, so it's understandable.
➖ It's not really a role-playing game as we (or at least I) are used to. There are no options in the dialogue; the story is cinematic and the same for everyone.
❌ Installs Epic Online Services automatically without prompting you for a choice. You can uninstall it anytime and the game will work just fine, but I really dislike these practices.
❌ Pfew, I'll say it. A POV slider would have been nice! The character takes up WAY too much of the screen space imo.


🕘 Release date: Sept, 2024
🕘 I've played it in: Oct, 2024
🕘 This would be my first experience with the Warhammer universe. A friend sent me a clip which got me hooked, and I ended up really enjoying the game!


⚠️ One of the greatest criticisms I have for this game, to be fair, is that ""there isn't enough of it"".
⚠️ The developers were clearly passionate when making this game. After learning about it and leading up to the first time I booted it up, I started ""going down the rabbit hole"" of the W40K universe. What I can see is that people, including the devs of this game, are strongly passionate about this universe. Their passion almost mirrors that which World of Warcraft had back in its ""glory days,"" which is really nice to see again. You can be sure that this game has had its details perfected! I'm glad I got acquainted with the W40K universe before starting the game so that I was able to notice those details.
⚠️ I have not addressed the co-op/multiplayer aspect, because I haven't tried it yet. Once my friends get the title too, I'll cover that as well. The game seems to be made for multiplayer overall and it looks like the multiplayer part is quite enjoyable, but it will use the same chapters from the campaign, making them replayable and giving you a progression system.
⚠️ Community Rating at time of review: Very Positive


🔙 I've not played the first game, just this one so far. I'm seeing that many people played the first game and were in awe to have a sequel even after a long time. The devs/publisher did them justice with this entry!
🔙 I played on Normal difficulty, as I no longer have the patience for constant struggle, but the tuning felt odd sometimes. Missing a dodge could cost 80% of your HP, while executing an enemy only restored 1%. The execution takes a few seconds, locking you into the animation and making you immune to the swarming enemies around you. It seemed unsatisfying that even the tougher foes only granted 1% regen. In my opinion, 5% would have made it more rewarding and fun. The contrast between losing 80% HP for a dodge failure and gaining just 1% from an execution felt odd. What topped it off was the fact that you were never in danger, due to your teammates being able to revive you. I did not die a single time. This seemed a bit strange to me.
🔙 Never cared much about Warhammer until this game showed up. Now, I've cast away the heresy and fully embraced the Emperor's light. No longer do I wander in the shadow of ignorance!

Сюжет
Сюжет очень простой, спойлерить не буду, но она мне зашла, тесно пересекается с сюжетом первой части(которую я не играл, но обязательно сыграю), что могу сказать вообще об сюжете - cюжет по типу ""этот злой того надо убить, а этот предмет надо сломать"", но даже так игра может удивить резкими поворотами, а в некоторых местах ты вообще не ожидаешь что произойдет дальше, в общем сюжет - нормальный, ставлю болтганов 7 из 10
Геймплей
Геймплей - обычное рубилово, но зато какое, крови жопой жуй, разных добивашек и анимаций тоже ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, есть парирование, уклон и какой то там выстрел и самое кайфовое это добивание... Тут добивание как в думе такое же кровавое и кайфовое, разные добивание на всех видов врагов от маленького жука тиранида до ебучего... А вы сами потом увидите кого можно добить, по крови тут 10/10 ее ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ и мне это нравится. За гемплей ставлю 9 ВАААГХ из 10.
Графика без вопросов - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, как будто фильм смотришь, мимика лица, качество брони, детали карты и вообще всего что есть на карте выглядит ахуенно. Про атмосфера карты и самой игры так же зашкаливает, в некоторых моментах идут мурашки по коже, настолько она ахуенна.
В общем ставлю 10 цепных мечей из 10
Главный герой он максимально продуман, его характер, его речь просто ахуенны, когда играешь за него ты ощущаешь себя настоящим лейтенантом роты ультрамаринов.
Капитан, Капеллан и Калгар - все они тоже сделаны прикольно и продуманно, у каждого из них разное отношения к гг, капеллан например не особо доверяет главному герою и говорит что он будет следить за ним всегда, капитан же любит гг(не в том смысле) он доверяет ему и выдает сложные задания, а Калгар просто обожает гг, он сильно доверяет ему и верит в него
Второстепенные персонажи - два второстепенных персонажа которые проходят с нами компанию они сделаны тоже очень хорошо, у каждого из них свой характер и говор, каждый из них относится к еретикам, тиранидам и гг разное, есть моменты в которых я за них сильно волновался
Персонажи в виде классов - играл я только за двух конечно, но потом обязательно сыграю за других.
Класс ""поддержка"" - молчалив и строг, общается только военными фразами и словами, за него убивать кайф, тяжелый болтер делает рататата и вот взорвалась врага голова
Класс ""Штурмовик"" - также молчалив, но менее строг, убивать за него отдельный кайф, он просто ненавидит еретиков и ксеносов, поэтому и кричит как он их сильно не любит
В общем за персонажей я ставлю 8 капелланов из 10
В общем я уверен что эта игра года, если же нет - меч императора мне в жопу, игра абсолютно заслуженно получила столько положительных отзывов.
Ставлю 10 сестер битвы из 10(прошу строго не оценивать мою оценку, делаю такую подробную впервые)",2024/9/30,ru
Zacirus,0,86.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zacirus/,"Pre patch 3, this game would have been one of my highest recommended Warhammer 40K games ever made.

Now? Probably not.

Gameplay loop and game feel were fantastic PRE Patch 3, some balancing was off, but overall it was hectic fun challenge on Ruthless/Angel of Death (Difficulty 4) and it felt like an earned victory when you and your buddies pulled it off.

Post Patch 3, there are practically no enemy hordes throughout each Operations level, certainly none that are overwhelming. There are tiny little groups of enemies that pose no real threat scattered distantly from each other so you have plenty of time to to kill the five or six enemies on screen and then run for 2-3 minutes taking in the sights with nothing to do to the next tiny group of enemies, any big bad type enemies spawn in basically solo, so you can easily focus them with no pressure and destroy them in seconds. Can now easily Duo every Operations on Difficulty 4 and grind with no real challenge, but why would I? It's dull to play currently and more prone to crashing.

The campaign was a fantastic, and focused fight for your life on launch and the story beats are still wonderful, loved seeing Titus make his return. Played on Angel of Death the first time through with a buddy and it took us about 10-12 hours. It was a really fun overcoming the odds by being a good team and covering each other. Not anymore.

Currently I could replay the campaign post Patch 3 on Angel of Death and solo it without resistance. That's not fun or a challenge. Why even have different difficulties at this point if they're all easy mode.

I will gladly change my review if they fix the spawn rates, fix the constant crashing and make this fun to play again.",2024/9/27,en

Crocchiaossa,1,19.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/crocchiaossa/,"Quando ho completato la campagna single player di Space Marine 2, mi sono trovato in una situazione piuttosto frustrante. Da un punto di vista estetico, il gioco è sempre stato eccezionale: graficamente impressionante e perfettamente fedele all'universo di Warhammer 40,000. Le battaglie epiche e gli scenari mozzafiato erano in grado di immergere completamente il giocatore, e l'esperienza single player, anche in modalità cooperativa, funzionava a meraviglia, offrendo ore di puro divertimento. Tuttavia, a quel tempo, c'era un grosso problema che mi impediva di godermi il titolo appieno.

Quando provavo ad accedere alle modalità multiplayer PVE e PVP, il gioco crashava costantemente dopo pochi minuti dall'inizio di una partita. Non ero il solo ad affrontare questo problema: molti altri utenti riportavano situazioni simili, il che rendeva la frustrazione ancora più grande. Avevo provato diverse soluzioni, ma senza successo, e mi trovavo costretto a valutare negativamente un gioco che, nonostante la sua qualità visiva e il suo potenziale, risultava ingiocabile per una parte significativa dell'esperienza.

Fortunatamente, con l'ultimo aggiornamento, tutto è cambiato. Gli sviluppatori hanno finalmente risolto il bug che causava il crash nelle modalità multiplayer, e ora posso dire che Space Marine 2 è tornato a essere un titolo che merita davvero. Le modalità PVE e PVP funzionano perfettamente, e posso finalmente godermi l'intero pacchetto di gioco senza problemi.",2024/9/21,it

Azhek Ahriman,0,16.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006679733/,"This review is long and will feel like a rant but its my genuine feelings and I don't think I am being too reactionary here.

Starting with the good/okay aspects.

The atmosphere in this game is truly incredible, you feel completely immersed in the 41st millennium and the sound design and animations are gorgeous.

The campaign is a solid 6.5/10 it is quite literally, just the first games story, rehashed slightly, complete with fun and interesting enemy, who you get to fight for too short of an amount of time, before the tedious and boring one. It fulfilled the power fantasy and was a compelling enough story that once it kicked off I wanted to see it through as quickly as possible.

The PVE Operations are the strength of this game by far, it is a lot of fun playing with two friends and earning gear and unlocking perks. I look forward to seeing how they expand on it.

Now for my issues with the game.

Customization is hidden behind a grind, which is fine, progression isn't inherently bad, however, the way you unlock emblems and color palettes feels needlessly convoluted, they can only be unlocked in a specific order once you pick a faction and the currency used to unlock things is shared with the PVE game mode perks, and the weapon skins making it a bit grindy. These customization options are really cool! But don't think you can place that particular Iron Warriors Skull on your RIGHT pauldron, I am afraid that one is restricted to the LEFT pauldron only. That really cool metallic you found that would be perfect for your chapter's main color? Sorry, that is a tertiary color only, it can be used for trim and nothing else.
Speaking of traitor marines, the customization for them is basically non existent (On a side note, after customizing my marine, I have played 12 straight games of Chaos where I can't see it, which is hilarious).

PvP is okay, but it feels more like a demo for the game mode that has yet to be released. There are only 3 maps, and 3 game modes. The classes all feel well made and overall balanced. Close combat however feels like it has the depth of a puddle, it is generally whoever lands the first attack wins. Parrying does nothing but block damage, there is no stagger, no window for you to attack back, your opponent can just keep flailing away and you must hope a teammate comes to your rescue. I think utilizing the very fun parry system in the campaign would've been a slam dunk and added depth. I mostly play sniper so this isn't hugely impactful for me, but still.

I could go on more, but honestly this game feels more like a demo than a full release, which is crazy to say after a decade of waiting. I will continue to play here and there with friends because I love the universe, but if this game was anything other than 40k I would not be playing it at all.",2024/9/21,en
Spidson,1,40.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/spidson/,"+I WILL BE USING THIS MORTAL VESSEL TO PASS MY JUDGMENT+

+It is with a gaze that has witnessed a million battles, a gaze that sees far beyond the limits of mortal comprehension, that I have deigned to examine this creation worthy of your time. And though the centuries have weathered countless conflicts, none have dimmed the fires of my eternal judgment. Hear me now, for my word is as binding as the stars themselves.+

+This... recreation of warfare seeks to glorify the deeds of the Adeptus Astartes, the finest of my creations, who carry my will into the void. In this, it is an admirable representation, capturing the brutal reality of battle with an unflinching hand. You, the player, are placed into the power-armored boots of a Space Marine, a once Captain of the Ultramarines, no less. Titus, once a hero of legend, returns to unleash righteous fury against the xenos filth that dare threaten the Imperium.+

+The graphics, like the eternal architecture of Terra itself, are grand and imposing, crafting a galaxy teeming with life and war. You will witness the burning skies, the shattered ruins of planets, and the never-ending tides of the enemy with such clarity that you might forget, for a brief moment, the fragility of your own existence. The immersion is total; you are the embodiment of my wrath, and for that, I commend the creators.+

+But let it not be said that my judgment is blind to faults. The enemies, while numerous and suitably grotesque, are repetitive in their design, much like the countless masses of orks and tyranids I have destroyed over millennia. Their minds are as predictable as the winds of Cadia before its fall. And though the combat is fierce and satisfying, there is a rhythm to it that one may find tiresome after enough time. Yet I understand the limitations of mortal creativity, and I am forgiving.+

+Where the game shines, however, is in the portrayal of the Adeptus Astartes. Each blow, each strike feels heavy with the weight of a thousand years of warfare, and each step resounds with the thundering presence of an unstoppable force. You are no mere man in this world, but a demigod among men, and the gameplay reflects that truth in glorious fashion.+

+The story, though not as intricate as the weave of fate I have spun for humanity, serves its purpose. It is a tale of defiance in the face of oblivion, a tale the galaxy knows all too well. Titus stands, as all Space Marines must, as the last bulwark against annihilation. Though his struggles are but a fragment of the grand narrative, they are a necessary reminder of the eternal struggle against darkness.+",2024/9/20,en

First off, the graphics? Stunning. The environments are drenched in that grimdark aesthetic we all crave. You step onto the battlefield, and it’s like stepping into a painting, only this one’s drenched in blood and glory. You can almost taste the power oh, how I love that taste!

Now, the gameplay. It’s intense, brutal, and oh-so-satisfying. You’re a Space Marine superhuman, unstoppable. You charge into the fray, and every swing of your weapon feels like a symphony of destruction. The visceral combat? It’s poetry in motion, folks. You’re not just playing; you’re dominating.

And let’s talk about the enemies. These guys are nothing but fodder for your glorious rampage. You’re the hero, the legend, the one everyone looks up to. You know what they say: if you’re not fighting for humanity, what are you even doing?

Metuz,1,87.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vinceh/,"As of writing this review I have never been more torn on whether to recommend a game or not.

The campaign has moments which will make Warhammer fans giddy like a kid at Christmas, especially on the last two missions (if you've played it you know.) Even non Warhammer fans will have a good time with this. The voice acting, graphics and audio are all strong.
However, it's criminally short. Took me about 5.5 hours to complete and I died...a lot.

The AI in this game is something out of 2004. Squad mates will watch you getting annihilated and not budge an inch, or decide to stand in front of you as you attempt to lay waste to heretics. It's infuriating, and something you'll need to get used to because the online matchmaking in SM2 is straight up cheeks. I hope you enjoy restarting your game a lot, and loading screens, because you'll become familiar with both.

Bugs, crashes, loooong loading times, and infinite loading times are going to likely infest your experience worse than any Tyranid could, and this after the game was already pushed back a considerable amount of time.

The core game play of SM2 is really solid. Any third person shooter fans, especially those that enjoyed Gears of War are going to have a great time. It's challenging, brutal and unapologetic in it's approach. It knows it's target audience and swings for the fences, and most of the time it connects.

This game will live or die in the next 3-6 months on how much the Dev will support it.
Fixing the myriad of tech issues, and bringing more content to coop and multiplayer. More maps are needed, it's a non-negotiable.

SM2 is a real mixed bag. A frustrating, disappointing mixed bag all within a room filled with potential. This could be something truly special but it's not there...yet.

I'm going to reluctantly recommend it purely because I'm a Warhammer fan, and there are moments in this game that are perfection, but as a non Warhammer fan wait for a sale. By that time you'll have a feel for how many of the issues have been fixed, and what the landscape is looking like with more content to make it worthwhile.",2024/9/17,en
Die Happy,1,129.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/die_happy/,"So 80 Hours in this game features 3 distinct parts.


TLDR: game looks and sounds great, very true to source material

campaign story is decent but nothing to write home about. great spectical but obviously parts were cut from it. maybe not enough time, still good fun, specially in coop.

PVE mode 3 player coop in style of darktide, L4F etc, has a lot of meat to sink your teeth into, customisation, leveling etc.

PVP more 6vs6 with 3 game modes and 3 maps. fun but lacking a lot of content and is a 2010 style shooter.

BUY if you like the PVE or PVP campaign is not worth the full price

LONG VERSION

outside of PVP the gameplay is a 3rd person shooter where you can often run out of ammo but that where melee comes in. this has a whole melee system with attack combos, blocking parrying, doging in it. kind of like the lastes god of war games. if you take damage you lose armor which regenerates after 30 seconds or you can execute enemies to get some back. when out or armor you loose health which you can get back by doing damage a short time after taking it. like in bloodbourne. if you miss that short mindow there are me packs that restore some health and some classes can get health back r hel other with it.

so now you run around and 20 small enemies + a handfull elites leading them show up. you shoot and melee the hell out of them taking damage, regenerating armour by executing which also give you i-frames. blocking, doging parrying etc. with enough pratice it becomes a dance of death. which can be really fun when you get into ""the flowstate"" of the combat.

a single player campaign:
playable with up to 3 players in coop. this is the main story. features no progression or leveling or armor customisation. the story is and plot is ok. nothing fancy but servicable. in terms of looks and sound its great though. bombastic and warhammer as hell. depending on your difficulty you will play this for about 8-10 hours. good for one playthough but thats it. there are a lot of shooters that deliver a better story. but the spectacle is here.

adjacent to the campaign is the operations mode:

you play 3 marines can choose from 6 diffent classes featuring unique skills and skill trees ofthen even unique weapons. you play 3 player coop missions kind of like darktide, left 4 dead etc. with a director that keeps thing fresh and sets up enemy spawns etc.

this mode features full leveling of weapons and classes with skill trees with 4 difficulty levels. this is where i spend 90% of my playtime. leveling different classes and their weapons earning ingame currency to buy their gear and customize their armor look from the 9 loyalist legions + a plethora of 1st and second founding astartes chapters. armor visual customization looks really good. in this mode i have arnound 60-70 hours and have maxed 4 of the 6 classes but often just a handfull of their available weapons.


next is the 6vs6 pvp modes, it is disconnected from the other modes in terms of progression and although you have the same classes some skills are slightly different and you only unlock weapon loadouts & cosmetics. there are no skilltrees or weapon skill trees. you also earn ingamemoney you can use in the operations mode to unlock new cosmetics and weapons.

you play loyalist vs traitors while for loyalist you can customize way the traitors models are locked in in terms of model but you can customize colors & emblems. so for example the vanguard is always a world eater, the heavy always death guard. but you can color them differently.

3 game modes, deathmatch, domination and capture and hold. on only 3 maps.
the game modes are fine, the maps are fine but it is all very COD 2010. spawncamping can easily happen. matchmaking isnt great. the melee system is gutted compared to pve modes, you can parry and block but besides negating damage but you dont get an advantage for it over the enemy. thoug melee ignores armor. besides that you regenerate armor faster than in pve and even heal quite fast.
it is fun but has its problems lacking content and using dated mechanics.

still very fun game and if you play the PVE coop mode or enjoy the PVP you can get a lot of hours out of it.
if you are only here for the campaign. better way for a sale.",2024/9/16,en

This latest installment in the Warhammer 40K universe sets a new standard for action-packed shooters with its impeccable blend of brutal melee combat, strategic gunplay, and stunning visuals. Saber Interactive really came through with this installment. It is a game that long time fans of Warhammer 40k truly have been asking for.

From the moment you step into the power armor of a Space Marine, the game impresses with its attention to detail. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking paired with a bombastic audio design, Space Marine 2 showcases the grimdark universe with a level of realism that immerses you completely. The environments are richly detailed, from the war-torn landscapes to the imposing architecture of the Imperium’s strongholds.

The combat is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The gameplay feels both fluid and weighty, with a seamless transition between hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry. The abilities and upgrades add depth and variety, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and exhilarating. The game’s AI is notably sharp, presenting a formidable challenge that keeps you on your toes without ever feeling unfair.

Narratively, the game excels in delivering a compelling story set against the backdrop of a galaxy in turmoil. The voice acting and script are top-notch, with a storyline that feels both epic and personal.

Multiplayer has a offering of diverse modes and a progression system that keeps the action engaging and competitive. Whether you’re battling in co-op missions or competing in PvP, the multiplayer experience is both rewarding and addictive. Looking forward to see what Saber Interactive does with future content.

In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a masterclass in combining thrilling gameplay with a deep, immersive world.

Craftless Rogue,1,12.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Revendawn/,"My Dearest Martha,

I write this letter having been beset by Tyranid scum and Chaos villainy. I have finished the main campaign with my AI brothers and there is much to say.

They say war is hell and while that is true here it is a very pretty hell. The sights and sounds of battle are massive in scale and in quality. Watching enemies explode into bloody bits or some magical dust ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was always satisfying. While most of my time was spent with two other squad mates there was always a feeling of a larger campaign at play. Sometimes from background battles raging, but also in those moments when you are charging forward alongside a massive army.

The spectacle is really incredible and I found, in general, the combat to be fun. Guns felt like that had impact and ""oomph"" melee weapons had weight. It felt good to run around, see the sights, and fight. All the pieces make for an extremely compelling experience that I couldn't walk away from, even if occasional issues would cause the odd rage-quit.

So let's talk about the bad stuff, because this has not been all roses. For every time you get a jump pack and the game gets 100x more fun there are a few things and missions that bring the overall experience down.

First off - this game is clearly a multiplayer/COOP game first. The AI squad is awful. They get the most important part right, which is trying to revive you if you go down, but beyond that they are poor in combat, and almost non-existent when it comes to objectives or tactics. Now it's okay to make a game where you want COOP as a focus, but if you are going to advertise and push that it's a solo game too you do need to properly support that experience and I think the game falls incredibly short in this key area.

In fact I think that if you had a better, more effective, and/or commandable squad the other issues I have might not matter. I also felt that for a giant armored Space Marine I felt like dolled up tissue paper. The game asks a lot in terms of special blocks, regular blocks, special dodges, regular dodges, pistol counters, executions, ranged fighting, and melee swarms all at once, but gives very little health and armor to support all of that even on the baseline difficulties. It doesn't make the game impossible by any means, but it does make it a little less fun.

Still I can't help but think that much of this is less of an issue if my squad was doing a better job of not making me fight everything mostly alone possibly while juggling objectives and in one really bad stage while also using a flamethrower to keep swarms at bay.

While I've focused on issues a bit I think overall my net experience with the game is far more better moments than troubled ones. There was only one stage I hated (the swarm bunker thing) and a few objectives that made me long for less brain-dead brothers at my side. It didn't prevent me from completing the campaign over a few days because I couldn't stop playing. They are also all issues that can be fixed.

So often we see games come out with problems way beyond the scope of a patch, but in the case of Space Marine 2 I don't think there is anything that couldn't be improved down the line. Hopefully they actually make some of these improvements, because I think this game could be damn-near perfect if they did.

Also as these issues are almost all tied to the single player experience, if you are playing online or with friends I think realistically you are just going to have a much better time. So it's an easy recommend to online/COOP players and while I still recommend it to solo player I do warn that there are some pain points, especially on higher difficulties from your AI companions.

At a time where my gaming has been an hour here, an hour there, try this, try that, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 became my world for a few days. Despite the blood and carnage of it all it was a glorious focus and a stellar time.

For the Emperor,

Alexai26,1,45.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198311354476/,"Para empezar habría que dividir en dos partes, una para personas normales y otra para fans de W40K, yo creo que seria la mejor forma de describir lo que es este juego.

Para personas normales, el juego se ve muy bien gráficamente, lo peor son los personajes, que se ven bien, pero no llega al fótorealismo de los escenarios, en cuanto a rendimiento, no lo estoy jugando a todo en alto/ultra menos las texturas, porque me pide más de 8 Gb de Ram de vídeo para poder usar textura en ultra. Yo he usado DLSS y obtengo una media de frames sobre los 60 a 2K, lo cual me parece muy bien optimizado, y no suele caer cuando llevan cientos de enemigos en pantalla. A mi me resulta muy familiar este juego con World War Z, en cuanto a mecánicas y dificultad, para mi no es un juego fácil, al igual que WWZ necesitas mejorar mucho tu equipo para poder sobrevivir a las oleadas, pero acaba de salir y todo esto estará sujeto a cambios. En un buen juego, para relajarte unas horas al día, masacrando enemigos de manera brutal, pero si quieres estar muchas horas enganchado, en mi caso me cansa, es decir, perfecto para jugar unas horas al día, pero a partir de 2 o 3 horas, puede hacerse pesado ese día, pero al día siguiente lo vuelves a disfrutar como un niño. Pese a la campaña, y los modos de juego PVE es necesario estar online para subir experiencia, si juegas offline, pues no avanzas, y en PVP evidentemente online siempre, ahora mismo el juego lo veo algo falto de contenido, supuestamente con el roadmap, van a seguir sacando nuevo contenido, pero hoy por hoy, para mi, lo veo escaso, el juego consiste en repetir y repetir hasta conseguir las mejores puntuaciones, tiempos y con la mayor dificultad.

Para fans de Warhammer, con todas las opciones de personalización en cuanto esquema de colores, adornos, insignias, te pasaras horas diseñando tu marine espacial preferido, tu propio capitulo e incluso si le echas imaginación tu propio personaje. Y en el modo foto, es como si tuvieras su partida de mesa de Warhammer en tu pantalla, todo el ambiente te lleva al loco y distópico futuro de W40K.

En resumen, el juego esta divertido, el contenido cosmético extra solo lo veo necesario si eres un fan aférrimo del W40K y te puedes permitir la burrada que vale cada tontería. Para una persona que no conoce W40K, puede parecerle caro o poco contenido, y que hay otros juegos mejores, para gustos los colores, solo espero haberte ayudado con esta reseña. De todos motos si no lo tienes claro, espera a la demo o ve vídeos de gameplay en youtube o streaming, ahora una cosa, el codec de vídeo no le hace justicia a como se ve el juego en tu pantalla.

NOTA: El juego usa servidores para el progreso y modos multijugador, pero según roadmap, se podrá crear un servidor privado y offline, y deberías subir experiencia, o al menos en modo offline como ocurre WWZ (esto esta en el aire, veremos a ver como lo hacen al final), se puede jugar perfectamente sin conexión a Internet en modo desconectado, o simplemente sin conexión a Internet. Lo único no avanzas en experiencia a tus personajes, por tanto no desbloqueas, mejoras, cosméticos, etc,

Como aclaración en WWZ, que tiene dos modos el online que tiene su propio nivel de progreso, y el offline, es decir, si yo juego online, y llevo a nivel 10, en el offline sigo a nivel 0 o viceversa. Yo me gusta así porque siempre no quiero jugar con gente desconocida, y simplemente me apetece macharcar Tiranidos a mi bola tranquilamente sin que el subnormal de turno me este disparando para que corra (esto es ya verídico, y si, hay fuego amigo).",2024/9/7,es

While having some fundamental changes to the mechanics, the core is still there - and the additions / changes don't remove anything; in fact it contributes to the power fantasy. With practice and dedication - and some nice Relic weapons, you can wade through Lethal like it's your first time doing Substantial.

The graphics are awesome, attention to lore is fantastic, and the overall feel of the game gives you a level of immersion I haven't had in ages. Some mentioned this is a reminder of what we've lost, but look at what's been found.

And consecrated by the gaming community!

Relic's done a pretty decent job so far handling the community, and their responsiveness and willingness to engage is a great predictor for the future of this game.

The Bloodiest Magpie,1,52.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019816127/,"Space Marine 2 is a long-awaited, much-hoped-for sequel to the first Space Marine game. You play as <REDACTED> (jk it's freaking Titus like that wasn't obvious enough) who starts off using Primaris-styled equipment as a regular first-born marine. Hmm. Can't say that's particularly lore accurate, but whatever, it's Titus so that's cool. Unfortunately he's no Mark Strong this time, can't blame him after everything that happened. Be aware.

I tried playing the campaign missions on Angel of Death difficulty. This will color my breakdown below.

The 'nids are, as expected, annoying ass space bugs that swarm you faster than skaven do at a Warpstone rave party, and they're fairly dangerous. In fact, each of them individually might not seem like a problem but start throwing in 3 or so hormagaunts and you'll start having more stab wounds than a mugging victim in London. The termagaunts, those little annoying freaking shooty bugs, appear to not wield regular fleshborers, since the damn things flash green like miniature rapid-fire venom cannons. If you don't know what a venom cannon is, I'll explain it further down below in the Warrior section.

All of these swarm mechanics overwhelming you through sheer numbers is really pronounced. I started having to take engagements carefully and seriously right from the get-go. You can't regenerate any health from simple executions this time either, you need to have taken damage recently (a la Bloodborne) and this makes Titus not only feel like tissue paper, but unable to recover easily. You need to use the medical stims and those are far and few in between, so they definitely took the 'its too easy' critique about the first game too much to heart. Titus will find these enemies dangerous and annoying in equal measure as a result, so don't go thinking you can charge into the jaws of hell and not get tarpitted harder than Abbadon facing a 50 block of guardsmen backed up by a Commissar Lord. They are just as fearless as said guardsmen and unlike Abbadon, Titus can't ♥♥♥♥ out like 10 attacks in a single round of combat, so you better hope you're good at parrying.

Note that while parrying or dodging or attacking, you are more or less animation locked. You can't cancel easily, and this honestly makes you feel a lot more sluggish than Captain Titus, who is now obviously the best version of Titus there was. This means you have to thin their numbers at range, hopefully reducing the 'gaunt variants down to less than 3 by the time the Warrior rushes you down.

Let's talk about Warriors. Warriors are the big 'nids that have that annoying ass whip, that annoying ass paired boneswords, that really annoying ass devourer, or that annoying ass venom cannon (that long snout thing).
The Whip is not too bad in a 1 on 1, just make sure to either stay clear of it while wiping out the small forms or...dunno, charge in and beat it to death before it can get really annoying. When it does that lash combo attack, it's very hard to parry so you're better off just trying to keep your distance and shooting it down.
The twin boneswords is just tanky. That's it.
The devourer is basically a rapid-fire fleshborer, and the Warrior who uses it is the most irritating PoS you will ever encounter. It will constantly skate away to the backline to pepper you with clusters of projectiles and it adds up a lot of damage very fast. Snipe this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as soon as possible. If you try to close in melee, it will sometimes unload every shot into you at point-blank range and you can die from this.
The last one, the venom cannon wielder, is the sniper variant. A venom cannon is like a biological railgun except instead of shooting a metal projectile it shoots this venomous acidic crystal that is superheated by the electrical discharge (yes, this is how it works in lore) and is launched at high speed to penetrate vehicles...or something. It didn't really work against real vehicles, but it definitely works against MEQ (shorthand for 'marine equivalent') like Titus. You will get a warning in the form of a sickly green laser tracking you and you can dodge the shot quite easily with good timing. The real problem is when one of them shows up and you are fighting a swarm or two and their Warrior melee cousins all at the same time, which is when things get nasty. Even then, its particular attacks are not hard to avoid, so either trust in your mobility or kill them off first, your choice.

There's more bug variants and their stupid tactics but I'm tired of talking about bugs so let's talk about weapons.

Gunplay and melee aren't mutually exclusive, it retains the general fluidity of the first game and you can swap between the two styles of combat very fast. Pistols are actually useful, they take their own slot and can help offset some disadvantages of your primary, while also serving as a way to perform kill shots on parried enemies.

Bolters. Holy Emperor the bolters. There are so many bolter variants, and some of them being very cross purposes with their actual function to the point it makes you wonder who needs this many variants. They are all lifted from the Primaris arsenal, and you get the whole freaking line of them (except Assault Bolters). Bolt carbines, heavy bolt pistols, auto bolt rifles, you name it they have it. In fact, I would argue that there are simply too many bolters. In the first game most of the same roles were replicated by unique weapons, such as the plasma gun, the lascannon, the vengeance launcher, and so on. Now you get...bolters.

Some of them are effective and some are not, but all of them are only average on Angel of Death difficulty so I didn't really find them to be that unique. What stood out were the non-bolter weapons, the Plasma Incinerator and the Melta Rifle.
The Plasma Incinerator is like a cross between the regular plasma gun and a very small plasma cannon, and it performs well enough in that role. It's plasma and it hurts.
The Melta Rifle is basically just like the melta gun from the first game. Tight AOE cone that does more damage the closer to the center of the aiming circle you get, huge shotgun blast that can melt anything.
There's some other stuff like the Las Fusil, which is basically just a lascannon if they scaled it down and in-game it's basically a Charge Rifle from Titanfall. It's still a good weapon, but they clearly learned their lesson from the first game where the lascannon's instant shot could utterly destroy an unfortunate enemy's face at close range.

Melee weapons unfortunately all feel a little samey. The chainsword is effective but it only swings in tight arcs and relies on a charge attack combo to stun enemies, which is extremely awkward compared to the first game where your stun/charge attack was another key altogether. This means it is very easy to start a chainsword combo then get hit for your trouble because you have no way of interrupting your enemy.
The power sword is a little more forgiving as it has actual stances that emphasize AOE or single target combat. It still has the issue of not being able to stagger big creatures reliably, or having a charge attack combo that matters, but it is reliable enough with its large sweeping attacks to actually outperform the chainsword on a regular basis.
The thunder hammer took a big hit from last game. It is just as sluggish and slow despite Titus' better augmentations, but is weaker. You can put a lot of hurt on enemies, but you have too many gaps open that leave you unable to defend yourself properly. Compare that to the first game, where the hammer's instant-kill damage and reliable stun combo can AOE wipe out hordes of daemons or whatever. It's very weak in this game.
The power fist staggers most enemies. Good enough.

So Is game gud? yes. Get. Play. Keel bug.",2024/9/10,en
RamboKush,1,35.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032228335/,"This is a rather difficult game to review as a non-Warhammer fan. Because from my perspective it is a competent hack-and-slash-shooter devoid of personable characters or any intriguing plot-elements. But to a Warhammer fan it is grimdark-personified; each human a cog in the Emperor's ever-marching war machine which renders every man and women as barren of life as the land itself.

Thus, this is less of a review of the story, and more so the game itself. Graphically, it looks rather stunning--with majestic vistas of the skull-regaled factories of the city worlds to the gruesome, steaming swamps of the backwater worlds. And while some people have reported issues of high-temps and crashes--issues that should be looked into and addressed--for the most part, and across a variety of systems, the game seems to run rather well. That shouldn't be a pro for any game, it should just be the standard. But it's 2024, so... bar's been pretty low for a while now.

The overall gameplay loop consists of running down un-inspired corridors to face random-sized groups of enemies. And while the campaign is mercifully and justifiably short, devoid of any diversity of gameplay or objectives, what you're then left with is the Operations Mode. Best described as a Raid Mode of sorts. You're expected to run through these over and over to level up your character(s) and your equipment to then run these maps on a higher difficulty. And therein shines both the game's main strength and its main flaw. In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war. And that motto does a lot to encapsulate the gameplay loop. There is only combat, and random objectives that rely on more combat. So it's a damn good thing then that the combat feels so damn good. Taking a chainsaw sword to a group of alien-baddies twice as short and thrice as frail as you will have you feeling like the Emperor's Chosen; pistols sound like a cannon and kick just as hard, and destroy just as much. Sniper Rifles are downright busted in the right hands. And I'll never, ever tire of grappling toward an enemy to deliver a skull-crushing dropkick. It speaks volumes that in a game with such limited enemy-variety and such non-existent diversity of gameplay I never got bored of the combat. It is fun, fluid and epic. It rewards aggression by granting you shields for each enemy killed through executions or perfect parries, and the ability to regen a bit of health lost to attacks if you're quick enough to retaliate. What isn't epic however is the un-inspired level-design, the lackluster repetition, and the horrid war of attrition that each mission eventually boils down to.
Each mission has a fixed layout and main objective, they don't change from match to match; instead, what does change is the placement of enemies, the number of them, and the amount required of each objective. Sometimes you'll be forced to place two bombs, another time you'll be forced to place five. And while this doesn't do a whole lot to shake the tedium of repetition, what it does do--however--is change the difficulty rather drastically. You can run into a couple of tiny one-shot guys one run, and a horde of huge, melee-focused guys another. And that would be fine if it wasn't for the limitations of their combat system. Because while it is fun, it is also rather limited in your ability to utilize it for your own survival. Like I said above, you can regen a bit of health lost if you're quick enough with a melee attack, and you can regain shields through executions or a shot to the head through the use of a perfect parry. What this does is promote an aggressive playstyle that rewards parries of the smaller enemies, and the executions of the larger ones. However, larger, melee-based elites don't give shields for perfect parries. And so, with the random spawns of enemies, you could find yourself surrounded by ten melee-based enemies and be unable to regain shields--meaning you'll watch your health dwindle and be unable to do anything about it. Worse, if you're then at the same time getting pummelled at range, which completely removes the ability to act quick enough that you regain a bit of lost health. Well, you can get better perks, of course. But that doesn't change that fact that random spikes in difficulty that skill cannot compensate for aren't fun; difficulty doesn't mean tediousness. And with a failed run meaning the potential loss of gathered upgrade materials, it being up to chance rather than skill is frustrating at best, and infuriating at worst. I'm not max level yet, and so maybe there are more perks to counteract such things, but it doesn't make the grind to get to max level any less annoying.

Class Progression is rather limited. You've no choice in what perk to begin with, meaning there's not really any build-variety. Weapon Progression offers a bit more variety, allowing you to choose whether you favour less speed and more damage, or vice versa.

Multiplayer is fine. It's a nice little relic of the early 2000s obsession with tacked-on versus modes. Little unbalanced, perhaps. But all the more nostalgic for it. It has a rather limited customisation-system. Grapple-hook dudes can use a Knife and a Sword but cannot use a power-fist. Shield-Bros can use a power-fist but cannot use a hammer, etc, etc. Fans might blame that on lore--but if that's the case, I don't really see why you'd offer customization at all. Better then to do perks, rather than equipment.

I do find it rather strange how unwelcoming the game is of newcomers. It doesn't go out of its way to ever explain any role, word or lore-based concept. And while one could argue that it is a game for fans, thinking that a Triple-A publisher would ever make a game of this size and not want to attract newcomers is downright naive. If you're not already a fan you'll either be real confused about a lot of what they're talking about, or you'll be spending half your playtime on the wiki. Overall it's a decent hack-and-slash-shooter that won't ever impress any non-Warhammer fan or person who enjoys a greater diversity of gameplay; it's all corridors and button-presses and horde-styled defence finales. But on the flip-side, it seems to be a delight for Warhammer fans; a crunchy, blood-soaked romp through a world of stainless steel and great, towering cathedrals, filled with horrid tech bonded with flesh, robot-skulls, and weapons galore, all of it in the Glorious name of the Emperor!",2024/9/15,en

I guess Saber is unaware what happened with Helldivers 2, I just hope it doesn't take them as long to realize no one wants these changes. Limited ammo uses, sounds really dumb for heavies and snipers that rely on ammo but ok, tougher enemies, they already take 3/4 of the mag to get to the executable stage but ok.
-70% melta-bomb damage to bosses? It only has one use, and that was its designated purpose, what were you thinking? The worst offense being, putting the imaginary leash on teammates so if the need to restore armor is present it CANNOT be done unless teammates are nearby? Who thought that was a good decision, I would love to see how that idea was received in the board room if Saber even held a meeting for this design choice.
Either none of Saber plays their own game or they just wanted their player base to leave because playing one game would have told you that snipers, assaults, and vanguards tend to leave their allies to focus on damage dealers to help the team but now they are punished for doing so. Having to constantly check to see if your team is near you so you can restore your only source of replenish-able health is insanely stupid and means that if we use our ability to grapple, or jump pack to a distant enemy (which is what its class is literally SUPPOSED TO DO) we are punished for it by not receiving armor back.

Hart,0,30.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994056144/,"Very pretty, but if you're looking for interesting gameplay, look elsewhere.

The environments are very well designed and the graphics engine does an admirable job of bringing large hordes of enemies to life. The art team clearly loved this game and the wealth of visual inspiration found in the 40k universe makes for an environment that's consistently grimdark and occasionally breathtaking despite the dark, oppressive story beats.

However, the gameplay is too basic to remain entertaining for long. Melee is a one-button affair with a push-X-to-parry system that wants to draw comparisons to Arkham Knights but feels more like a ""push X to not die"" scene from a mid-2000s action game. You do not dictate the pace of combat and any aggression on your part is immediately punished with chip damage from ranged fire and minor foes on your flanks. That chip damage swiftly mounts into fatalities. You -must- parry and retaliate, exploiting the invulnerability allowed by the retaliation and execution animations to restore your armor, slowly wearing down swarms of foes at a pace that is simply out of character for Space Marines.

Guns are inaccurate unless you're aiming down sights, ammunition is sharply limited, and anything worth shooting is also either resilient enough to shrug off ranged fire or capable of blocking sniper rounds with a sword. If an ally engages an enemy you can pop off a few head shots to knock it into execution range, but for the most part you're better off wading into the melee horde yourself and tediously retaliating your way to victory.

The visual character customization is beautiful but harshly restricted and/or greedily monetized, the equipment specialization and character growth are slow and ineffectual until you get one of a the handful of major abilities scattered throughout a 25 level grind. Relics and other equipment make more of a difference visually than in combat effectiveness - an additional 10% damage doesn't take you from 6 heavy attacks to 5 to stun a warrior, but the max rank sword sure does look a little prettier than the starter sword.

To cap that all off, in multiplayer every player has to play as a different class - but you can't select your class and then queue into a team where you're not competing for that class spot. There's about a 1 in 3 chance that someone has already selected the class you want to play when you join a team, and you can't progress your class if you can't play it, so expect to have to leave and re-queue, sometimes multiple times in a row, in order to play a preferred class in multiplayer.

The final nail in the coffin, then, is that despite the shallowness of the gameplay and the general jank of the multiplayer system, this game is terribly short, confusingly lacking in content despite having so little depth. There are only six campaign missions, which have no replayability. The only other option for PvE are operations, but again, there are only six operations. This is a full-priced $60 game that you could finish in a day, that nonetheless expects you to grind out 48 mission completions with each class to unlock visual armor.",2024/9/7,en

Quackers,0,52.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/QuackerCracker/,"Please realise that this is literally one of the only games I've been looking forward to for a very very long time. I was hoping of actually enjoying a game for the first time in months, just for everything I feared to manifest after more than just a few hours of gameplay. Initially I thought the game was phenomenal, the weighty thump of the bolters, the tearing viscera of chainswords, the diverse abilities and a 2010s storyline packed with an explosive finale. I finished the game on the 2nd highest difficult, as reccomended, and wanted to try out more gameplay.

So I decided to play outside of the story mode.

The highest difficulty, Ruthless, shows the true colors of this game. After breezing through the first three difficulties and getting my class to high level, more issues began to arise as I became more intent on progressing my weapons. That's when the most glaring problems began to show; the combat is incredibly clunky with parries and snapshots almost guaranteeing you will be hit by 2-3 other enemies if you take them. The enemies themselves are monotonous to fight against with less AI responsiveness than even Halo Reach had, a game 14 years old. There's only six operation missions in total that most of them range from tedious to straight out not fun (people know the agony of the Heldrake mission while playing as Assault/Vanguard/Bulwark). The assault fails in any degree of melee, despite being for its namesake an ""assaulting"" class to get into close combat, meanwhile the fully-ranged heavy's best weapon is its close range multi-melta. PvP is a mess with a TTK that feels either like I'm playing HLL/Squad but swaps to Halo Reach but everyone has armor lock in an instant. Trying to play the campaign again shows how much the story was the definition of a one-time experience with much of the plotholes and abandoned storylines showing far more glaringly on the second playthrough. Almost all the weaponry is borderline identical save for the melta which is the only usable weapon in high level Operations, of which you will probably be kicked if you aren't using a melta or playing Bulwark 60%%+ of the time. The lack of mechanical flow in the melee kills any degree of skill-based gameplay with even using core mechanics like parrying and snapshots working against you 90% of the time by opening yourself up to other attacks for a solid 1+ second. In melee you are entirely powerless against any more than 3-4 enemies even if its just gaunts or tzaangors. Of which, even the most minor of enemies take several shots/hits to even stagger them (again, unless you use a melta). Tack all of this onto a subpar overall multiplayer experience with three total maps, 60-90+ second load times on a current-gen PC, an AI that would barely function as a support chatbot on a corporate website, borderline unfair enemy spawns (neurothrope vs melee-centric teams), ranged enemies that you can't even see shooting through entire buildings and walls, and to cap it all off I can't even play as a custom or my favourite chapter without hearing them recite a voice line about Ultramar or the Guilliman every 15 seconds.

It feels like they were rushed to do the bare minimum to call it a ""complete"" game, but failed to do any quality testing beyond the initial gameplay mechanics. These are all things they can, and I hope certainly will, fix in a few weeks to months of patches, but if you want a complete list of changes I would suggest and that I've seen others propose, you can read them below.

- Add I-Frames to parry/snapshots like executions currently have
- Have melee regenerate small amounts of HP on kill or increase the current healing mechanic in melee dramatically as stimpacks are way too far and few between while having no real way of getting HP back
- Nerf the melta's HP regen while buffing ranged HP regen hit (You can go from 1-100% HP in a single shot of melta vs getting maybe 10-15% of your HP back with a bolter)
- Remove the stagger from the melta (I don't think anyone can argue that having a melta on Ruthless makes the game 10x easier when the enemies can't even swing back and hordes disappear in 1-2 shots)
- Increase practically all bolter damage to actually be a real bolter and annihilate soft targets in 1-2 shots
- Rework Operations Assault entirely - Copy/pasting the current PvP Assault mechanics onto Operations, make the hammer viable with faster swings/heavies, make the fist viable by doing massive single-target damage
- Add more boss-oriented Operations or alternative endings (the final boss fight in the campaign was 10/10 and the Hive Tyrant was pretty good as well)
- More melee weapons that actually feel different. A power axe for anti-elites, eviscerator for anti-horde, and so on.
- More hordes. There's too many times where I feel like I'm fighting a probing force rather than an entire hive invasion fleet.
- Make walls actually solid and ranged enemy attacks not go through them (pretty obvious)",2024/9/18,en

I don't have time for 4000 hours to drop into this game as I got university and a job to upkeep. I play games to relax. This is not what I want outta SM2. Sure add another difficulty bar, make higher levels higher and more difficult, that is fine. This doesn't mean you should make the other lower levels harder just because you felt like it. This is not the way to make a good game, this makes people hate it.

Industry-wide people hate the everloving crap outta nerfs, especially in co-op PVE shooters. Helldivers 2 is an excellent example. They had extreme nerfs which caused people top recoil and despise it, only to return when Arrowhead released the mother of all buffs to win back player loyalty. And it worked, maybe not a whole lot, but its a step in the right direction and what you need to do as well.

Nerfs are never the answer, making a game increasingly punishing for casuals isn't either. This is your Helldivers moment, Saber, don't ♥♥♥♥ this up.

Griselbrand,0,40.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/griselbrand/,"Game is fun, great action, beautiful set pieces. But my god, this game has some serious bugs to work out. And they randomly seem to get worse.

Matchmaking is horrrrible.

I spend so much time just trying to get into a match and every step along the way the game is likely to give you an error after a long load screen. Sometimes immediately upon selecting match make it gives you loading screens and then times out, sometimes you're still in your own world and someone else tries to join you and times out. Sometimes you are trying to join someone else's match and long load screen and... times out.

Then, when you finally manage to join a match with other players, half the time you've both chosen the same class and one of you is forced to leave or change to another class that you may not have leveled up high enough to the difficulty you've already selected when choosing matchmaking, you now have to quit the matchmake or risk sabotaging the match for the other players because you dont have the right perks/weapons on this character to pull your own weight.

It's just a badly designed process. And this could at least be balanced out if the game was tuned in a way that you could actually manage things solo. But that's not possible with the garbage NPCs they give you for squadmates. Unless you're max level with max level guns, you're likely not going to be able to pull off even the first operations on easy difficulty.

So much of this game needs more time to cook. Look at the subreddit and you'll see posts like where you upgrade the same weapon and some of its stats go down. Why is that a thing? Not a variant weapon, but the same one has lower stats at a higher level. It's just nonsensical stuff.

I have yet to successfully close the game via the ingame menu without it freezing. Have to alt+f4 or force it to stop via steam. At the end of every mission I either get disconnected or sit through incredibly long load times as the game hangs, then disconnects me from the squad I was with.

Oh, and then the few times I've managed to get a really solid group together and are crushing a mission, 30+ minutes in, the game can hard crash where I'm then forced to reboot my PC and there is no option to rejoin squad mates. So not only do you not get to complete the mission, you get literally zero rewards from it. No XP per kill or per objective completed while you were in the mission. XP only comes at the end of the mission... Again, who in 2024 came up with these backwards ideas and terrible net code?

This game is ultimately just not End User friendly. It wastes your time. The entire time I've been writing this I've been stuck at the end of a mission load screen and am once again going to have to alt+f4. What a mess.",2024/9/29,en

Darth_Malice,1,16.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarthMalice/,"Да нормальная в принципе игра. Если игры 2011 года уже можно называть неким олдскулом - то да, такой олдскульный, мясной экшен, без собирательства и прокачки.

Даром, что коридоры-коридоры - всё очень красиво сделано, куча деталей, игра конечно не бенчмарк, но уж за графоний точно хочется похвалить, сочно, кроваво, динамично.
Стрельба сильно лучше, чем в первой части, я в принципе 2/3 игры наверно стрелял, чем в рукопашке (играл в коопе, и было кому меситься на мечах). Арсенал разнообразный, есть для разных врагов, с разными фишками, но вау от пушек нет, просто выполняют своё назначение. Стрелять удобно и прикольно, пока есть тираниды, но чуть скучновато. На геймпаде, кстати, управление совсем не понравилось, неудобно, играл на клавомыши.
""Ульта"" теперь у всех персонажей разная, полезная по-своему, никак не развивается. Бестиарий достаточно разнообразный для не очень длительного прохождения. Мясорубка мясная, у оружия ближнего боя есть даже по паре простых комбо.

Cordic,0,84.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198194856986/,"Balancing is a big issue. Weapons are way to weak to be used in a Power Fantasy world. Recent updates show the Saber Devs did not hear the community and are taking the same path the Devs did with Helldivers2 and this will kill the community just like it did with Hellsdivers2. Nerfing weapons and grenades, parry, was not needed and the game is even less fun now. Still no way to regen health which is critical because Armour does not protect the character that much at all, so health regen is sorely missed from the first Space Marine game. Some (most) weapons like All Bolter weapons are specificly way to weak, in lore these are the main weapons for a Space Marine and they are not properly represented here at all ( add Plasma is not proper either ).

Still can not freely choose the class we want to play because the Devs limited the class to one of each per match ( So stupid to put limits on what class people can choose to play and to force them to change is unexceptable ). This is a huge problem for me as it just seems wrong to do this.

We have to go through 4 loadings screens before actually entering the game. All games need to just stop this, seriously. Then leaving a match there are several loading screen that also can not be skipped. So when you try to get into a match and you have to back out because someone else is playing the class you want to play as, you have a ton of loading screens to go through and then back through, just to try and get into a match. Hopefully you dont get disconnected from the frequent Server Disconnect errors this game has, which have been there since day 1 and Early Access.

JecoX,1,9.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xjecox/,"Bueno, juego frenético, gráficos bien logrados, combate muy bueno y muchas hordas que nos gusta, aunque se ve que fue diseñado primero pensando en consolas por lo falta de opciones gráficas para poder castigar a tu GPU y exprimirle lo que tiene y lo que no tiene. Para un hiper fan de la franquicia pues te va a decir que es the best of the best pero no llega a eso, para un hater le va dar negativo porque simplemente es lo que es un hater o es un jugador que compra por impulso sin saber a lo que va o no es su tipo de juego y se agarrara de los pocos fallos que tiene el juego para hablar mal y darle negativo, como siempre pasa. El juego es bueno peeero con campaña muy corta 6-7 horas en normal, por lo que recomiendo jugar a dificultades mas altas si no quieren terminarlo antes de que pensaran que llevaban 1/3 del juego y resulta que es el final de la campaña, otra cosa que no me gusto es el uso excesivo de ascensores, no se si es para cargar los escenarios o el motor no aguanta tanto, por otro lado, los enemigos se repiten mucho por lo que terminas pasándolos muy fácilmente por lo tanto que se repiten ya que te aprendes las mecánicas. Tiene otros modos de juego que aumentan la jugabilidad como son las operaciones, me parece acertado y jugar en cooperativo es excelente, te sientes como un marine espacial jugando con tus amigos. en resumen recomendado pero ya sabes sus puntos fuertes y puntos débiles para poner en balanza si quieres invertir dinero en sus diferentes versiones o esperar que baje un poco de precio.",2024/11/7,es

Плюсы.
Великолепные сражение с полчищами Тиранидов да и битвы с тысячами сынов приносят радость.
Визуальная часть игры это отдельный вид оргазма. целую руки художников.
Операции. кооп миссии с прокачкой своего класса. на данный момент их 6, после 60 часов проведенных в них я хочу продолжаю их перепроходить. В будущем конечно ждем новых заданий.
Кампания. Пройдена на 3 уровне сложности в коопе. Она прекрасна, она великолепна. Думаем проходить на 4 сложности.
Великолепная локализация.
Кастомизация. Привет всем кровавым вороном из dawn of war.
Все первые легионы детей императора присутствуют. Ордены есть, их не много но все же есть, еще часть орденов наследников ультрамарин в сезоном пропуске. КРОВАВЫЕ ВОРОНЫ ПРИСУТСТВУЮТ.
Думаю основные плюсы я отметил. Возможно что-то упустил.

Сезонный пропуск с ценником 2199. Для комфортной игры он вам не нужен так как это набор косметики, но цена на него, меня лично пугает. Я понимаю что это не лишние деньги для разработчиков, но все же это цена некоторых игр.
Новый игровой контент по заявлению разработчиков будет бесплатным.

Ну и ложка дегтя.
На данный момент серверам бывает плохо. Тот же самый Бастион чувствует себя неприятно на передовой с лагами. да и другим не проще. К счастью это все поправимо, ждем патча.
Ну и нужно что-то делать с серым HP(Оспариваемое здоровье). билды через оружие с большой площадью поражение ломают эту систему. Можно восстановить себе полное здоровье.

Hoy vengo a hablarles de una joya, una obra de arte hecha con metralla, músculos y absolutamente ninguna gota de piedad: Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2. Un juego que es como un mazazo en la cara, pero con amor. Porque claro, nada grita “amor” como una armadura de tres toneladas aplastando a una horda de alienígenas viscosos que gritan cosas que ni su madre entiende.

Aquí encarnas a un Ultramarine, esos señores vestidos como si fueran a una boda espacial pero, en lugar de regalar toallas o relojes, traen pura destrucción. ¡BOOM! ¡PUM! ¡CLANG! Vas por ahí soltando espadazos, disparos y comentarios filosóficos como: ""La muerte es la paz verdadera, pero mientras tanto... ¡TOMA!"" La trama es lo de menos. Lo importante es: ¿cuántos bichos puedes aplastar antes de que tu monitor te pida un descanso?

Visualmente es como una explosión de fuegos artificiales lanzada por un orco con resaca. Colores oscuros, gritos, fuego, más fuego y explosiones que te hacen sentir como si estuvieras dentro de una olla de presión, pero con estilo. ¿Los gráficos? Impresionantes. Cada gota de sangre alienígena tiene la delicadeza de un pintor renacentista en ácido.

El combate es pura brutalidad, cada golpe se siente en la médula. ¡Y los enemigos! Bueno, son como los mosquitos en verano: nunca se acaban, y por cada uno que matas, aparece otro peor.

Conclusión: Si alguna vez te preguntaste cómo sería ser un gigante de metal con la sutilidad de una apisonadora, este juego te lo responderá. Y si no te lo preguntaste, también te da igual, porque lo vas a disfrutar igual de todas formas. Es brutal, es épico y no tiene ni un segundo de descanso.",2024/9/16,es
ZTyoho,0,57.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198201426425/,"总结：非粉丝只买标准版最低难度单人战役爽一爽就好，建议等打折，因为它不值这个价。

单人战役确实很爽，没有数值成长，武器选配没有职业限制。外观可选项有限，目前只有豪华版赠送的右肩肩甲和两个武器皮肤可以在单人战役用。

多人有严重的平衡性问题，跳包pvp一砸一个准pve查无此人，爆矢枪pvp打玩家还算疼pve就是泼水。我pvp浅尝辄止就不多说了。pve武器数值有卡拉赞悖论，金枪要打最高难度但没有金枪很难打最高难度……能纯靠肝打满的只有职业天赋和外观涂装。另外，这游戏季票只是给你购买的资格，内容本身全是外观涂装，还要靠你自己肝金币买。往好处想是起码你氪金与否和强度无关（笑）。

角色性能相比初代不进反退，pve开荒练级阶段负反馈太多，很多职业改变游戏体验的关键天赋给得太晚，角色性能不是成长，而是强行拆成碎片再让你一点点捡回来。备弹药包资源紧缺，敌人却各种霸体疯狗，近战能格挡弹反但是一进敌群血量瞬间蒸发。热熔和下挂榴弹的爆矢枪以外的枪械没办法把敌人打出硬直，而打断敌人行为才是游戏内求生的最关键因素，这导致绝大多数武器做出来也没人用，只有狙击的蓄力激光因为数值超模成为了对boss特攻。目前pve现状不是某个武器好用某个武器难用，而是不用特定少数配装直接没法玩。

网络方面，国区联机困难，加速器也不一定顶用，而且联机系统非常傻，几乎没有异常自检，掉线必须退回标题界面重登。一旦在匹配阶段和房主断联，至少需要先切换单人模式再切回多人模式这种奇怪的机魂安抚仪式，否则你重新匹配就是在空转，等四万年也等不来队友。

总的来说这个游戏单人战役体量不足，多人成长曲线陡峭，新鲜期短，反作弊形同虚设，获取正反馈代价较高，学习时间长深度却很浅，没有粉丝厨力的轻易别碰。",2024/9/14,zh-cn

IF YOU SUFFER FROM MOTION SICKNESS THIS MIGHT NOT BE YOUR GAME.
if you DO NOT suffer from motion sickness then this game is metal af. buy it lol.

the narrow fov with no adjustability is the only deal breaking issue i have with the game. i dont wanna give the game a bad review because the other aspects of the game are great, BUT its basically unplayable for me.
i can only play for about 2 hours on my desktop setup before i had stop because i was becoming physically ill.

However playing on my htpc setup with a 50” tv several feet away is tolerable.

in 2024, an fov slider is a basic QOL option for most people and for some (like me) is a legit accessibility option that makes the game playable.
not having an fov slider is like not having subtitles for the hearing impaired.

IF an fov slider is added i will update my review to positive cause the rest of the game is alot of fun

It would be a 10/10 Emperor mandated purchase but there were a few gamebreaking bugs that me and my friend encountered during our playthrough that made us have to restart several times.

The pvp is skill based and requires you to move as a unit like OG halo multiplayer and the movement feels a lot like gears of war minus the cover to cover aspect of moving in that game.

The Campaign immediately entered my top 5 best campaigns along with Halo and Last of Us. The final missions is pure unfiltered fan service and I couldn't get enough of it.

The Scenarios are also awesome and provide a good bit of replay-ability with the perks and cosmetic unlocks and each class feels powerful in their own right.

One of my personal favorite things in this game has to be NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS!!!

I'm not joking when I say I've simply started scrolling through twitter and watching whole YouTube videos whilst waiting for things to load, and it also turns out that despite having downloaded the game for no less than 4 hours, I am SOMEHOW missing some ""Epic Games Multiplayer Files"". For some reason, loading into the Campaign requires connecting to a server, and basically every single cut-scene has either frozen itself partway through, has had such delayed audio that it's genuinely confusing as to who's saying what unless you have Subtitles on, or flat out just crashes the game. That half an hour I've actually been able to play the game was fun, I admit, but that simply does NOT excuse how everything outside of the gameplay seems to have been handled.

Oh, and on a separate note, a friend of mine from the UK wanted me to gift this for them when it released today and I couldn't due to ""Regional Price differences"". Turns out that people in the UK are paying what is effectively an extra $12 in USD for this game compared to Americans, so please do note that if you are from that region across the big pond.

Meu GOTY de 2024

Jogo de homem, testosterona pura, feito para quem é fã de Warhammer. Vai tirar lágrimas dos teus olhos, finalmente chegamos no AAA e merecemos esse lugar.

Combate rápido e responsivo, gore à mostra, te dá um feeling de ser um Super Soldado. Se você quer o aspecto de power fantasy, jogue no mais fácil, porque nas duas últimas dificuldades o Titus é feito de papel, e você tem que ser inteligente e ver o combate como algo mais tático.

As armas de combate corpo a corpo são extremamente fortes, o que faz com que os vários bolters do jogo sejam armas de suporte. O Martelo é a última arma de combate corpo a corpo a ser desbloqueada e é fantástica para lidar com qualquer inimigo, até mesmo os chefões que estarão no seu caminho. Como era no primeiro jogo, carregar uma arma de dano alto, como uma sniper, e o martelão pro resto.

Diferente do primeiro jogo, a ""Rage"" do Titus não te ajuda muito, pelo menos nas dificuldades mais altas. Usar a Rage no meio de um monte de inimigos não vai te curar nada, você tem que ter visão de quando usá-la para poder encher sua barra de vida. O jogo conta com dois sistemas de vida: o HP, que só pode ser curado com a Rage e os Medpacks espalhados pelo mapa (no máximo, você vai achar 4 por nível, e eles nem recuperam a vida toda, recuperam cerca de 40% da sua vida total), e a Armadura, que vai ser sua real vida, sendo recuperada com o tempo ou com execuções nos inimigos. Raramente você vai executar um inimigo fraco, isso se reserva aos Elites. O jogo se torna um samba onde você mata centenas de mobs básicos enquanto foca em colocar o elite em um estado de execução para se manter vivo dentro do combate.

Posicionamento é mestre tanto contra os quanto contra os , mas as hordas insetoides oferecem um desafio muito maior do que os . Esses insetos malditos vão te cercar tanto de perto quanto de longe, com granadas que obstruem seu caminho e pragas que vão deixar sua visão turva. Já os feiticeiros são mestres em combate de longo alcance, mas os Marines não são tão perigosos quanto os cultistas com rifles snipers, que juntos destroem sua vida e me colocaram no chão várias vezes.

Cutscenes lindas, história básica, mas que invoca tudo o que Warhammer representa com os Ultramarines, Anjos do Império do Homem, que chegam na hora em que o Império mais precisa para salvar o dia.

Mesmo eu não sendo fã dos Ultramarines, , eu gostei muito da caracterização deles. Parabéns à Saber.",2024/9/8,pt

Space Marine 2 เกมภาคต่อที่หายไปอย่างยาวนาน นานถึง 12 - 13 ปี เป็นแนว Action TPS Shooting ตะลุยเดินหน้ายิงแหลกกับเหล่าศัตรูเป็นพันๆ เป็น หมื่นๆ โดยที่ตัวเกมในภาคนี้ก็ได้เห็นการกลับมาของ Captain Demetrian Titus ที่เป็น Space Marien แห่ง Legion Ultramarien ที่มี Primarch เป็น Roboute Guilliman อีกครั้งหนึ่ง จากที่เขาหายไปอย่างยาวนาน แต่การกลับมาในครั้งนี้เขาจะโดนลดยศลงกลายเป้น Lieutenant ซึ่งมีตำแหน่งยศรองมาจาก Captain อีกทีหนึ่ง ในภาคนี้เขาก็ยังเป็นผู้ที่ได้เป็นผู้นำทีม Squad ใหม่ ที่ Captain คนใหม่ ที่ชื่อว่า Acheran ได้จัดตั้งให้ ซึ่งสมาชิกประกอบไปด้วย Gadriel ตำแหน่ง Sergeant (ผู้นำทีม Squad ก่อนที่ Titus จะมา) , Chairon , Lyreo , Altareus , Elion 4 คนนี้ ตำแหน่ง Battle-Brother ซึ่ง Titus ได้เข้าไปทำภารกิจ , ร่วมต่อสู้พร้อมเหล่าทหาร Imperial Guard สู้กับเหล่าศัตรู Xenos อย่าง พวก Tyranid เพื่อช่วยเหลือเหล่าผู้คนและดวงดาว

ตัวเกมในภาคนี้มีอยู่ 3 Mode หลักๆ คือ Campaign Story , Operation , Eternal War
- Campaign Story เป็นโหมด เนื้อเรื่องหลักที่ต่อจากภาคแรกที่ Captain Demetrian Titus หายไปอย่างยาวนาน และการกลับมาของเขาก็ทำให้เนื้อเรื่องน่าสนใจมากขึ้น ในโหมด นี้เราสามารถเล่น Solo หรือ Co-Op Up 3 Player ก็ได้ ซึ่งจะได้รับบทเป็น Titus , Gadriel และ Chairon
- Operation เป็นโหมด PVE ที่เราจะได้รับบทเป็น 1 ใน Space Marien ของ Legion Ultramarine ที่ออกทำภารกิจตามคำสั่งของ Captain Acheran หรือ Lieutenant Demetrian Titus โดยจะมีสมาชิกทั้งหมด 6 คนตาม Class ต่างๆ ทั้ง 6 Class ซึ่งเราสามารถเลือก Class เล่นได้ และสามารถอัพเกรด peck ของ Class ได้ ตกแต่ง Power Armour ได้ตามใจชอบ ในโหมด นี้เราสามารถเล่น Solo หรือ Co-Op Up 3 Player ก็ได้ (แนะนำให้เล่น Co-Op ดีกว่า)
- Eternal War หรือ PVP เป็นโหมด ต่อสู้กับผู้เล่นคนอื่น โดยที่จะแบ่งเป็น 6VS6 ซึ่งจะมี 3 โหมดย่อยให้เลือกเล่น 1. Annihilation คือ Team Deathmatch โหมดยิงกัน ทีมไหนกำจัดผู้อื่นได้มากที่สุดชนะ , 2. Seize Ground คือ โหมดเข้ายึดพื้นที่ตาม Zone เพียง 1 Zone ซึ่งจะมี แต้ม Point ให้ ก่อนจะหมดและเปลี่ยนจุด Zone ไปยังจุดอื่นๆ ทีมไหนเก็บแต้มได้เต็มก่อนชนะ และ 3. Capture ＆ Control คล้ายๆกับ 2 คือ โหมด เข้ายึด Zone 3 Zone ซึ่ง Zone ในโหมดนี้จะไม่ขยับไปไหน ทีมไหนเก็บแต้มได้เต็มก่อนชนะ สามารถ ตกแต่ง Power Armour ของแต่ละ Class ได้ตามใจชอบ มี 6 Class เช่นกัน

ข้อดี
- Gameplay ดีมากๆ สนุก
- Graphic สวยงามมากๆ
- เนื้อเรื่องน่าติดตาม
- มีซับไทย (ข้อดีสำหรับคนไทย)
- มี Roadmap ตามอัพเดตให้ ตลอด 1 ปี เพื่ออัพเดต Content ใหม่ๆ

ข้อเสีย
- บัคยังพอมีอยู่
- ซับไทย มีแปลผิดบ้างแต่ไม่มาก , มีคำตกหล่น เป็นต้น
- อาวุธน้อยไปหน่อย
- Story ถือว่าสั้นไปหน่อย
- สี ชุดเกราะ Power Armour ของ DLC ยังต้องไล่ปลดล็อคอีกทีหนึ่ง

เกมนี้เป็นเกมที่เล่นไม่ง่ายและก็ไม่ยาก แต่ก็สนุก กราฟฟิกสวย แนะนำให้ซื้อมาเล่น คุ้มมากๆ โดยที่ แพ็คแต่ละแพ็คประกอบไปด้วย

Если по подробнее: Очень подпекающие пятую точку бои на сложности ветеран и выше (в основном если проходить в одиночку); Атмосфера передана на 10 из 10, на мой взгляд фанаты Warhammer 40000 оценят; Музыкальное сопровождение на уровне, всё по канону; Сюжет интересный, частично повторяет первую часть и, по-моему мнению, коротковат; Испытания для классов в мультиплеере по сути есть обучение этому классу, что очень удобно (и ещё приносит монетки для открытия элементов и цветов брони); Кастомизация персонажа в компании никакая - она вся сосредоточена лишь в мультиплеерных персонажах. Пока игра не вышла, наблюдаются проблемы с серверами, но я думаю это поправимо.
Отдельная благодарность за оптимизацию! Когда на игроков нападает рой, игра не проседает от слова совсем (чему Сэйбер научились в World War Z).

Batman,1,65,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatGuyCronin/,"Short Version:
Visually beautiful game, fun gameplay, good amount of variety in classes, few bugs, lots of re-playability, Co-Op PvP and PvE, beloved lore and well loved franchise.


Long Version:

Space Marines 2 is a sci-fi and gothic dark fantasy with biblical motifs that make Warhammer 40k awesome. The sheer and immense sense of scale, both indoors and outdoors perfectly capture the depth of the world that is Warhammer.

You can feel the immense love for the lore and source material, it's definitely made by fans who genuinely care about this world that is imbued through the visuals and attention to detail in every facet and asset.

This is every Warhammer 40k fan's wet dream.


Pros:
• Impressive visuals with lore-accurate art direction. The brutality and bleakness of the 40K universe are masterfully conveyed
• Superb combat system that equally rewards skill, resource conservation and a tactical, team-oriented approach. Very easy to pick up and get better. Pacing is done very well
• Solid variety of enemies, all of which have unique behaviors, movesets and abilities
• Bosses that evolve their movesets dynamically, and are highly challenging on the harder settings
• The 40K lore is accurately transposed and faithful to the series canon
• Enjoyable, well-written storyline, compounded by plausible characters and interesting events
• Exploration and Customization are rewarded
• DLC's are purely cosmetic, all future content is already planned ahead of time and content is free


Cons:
• AI companions aren’t smart enough for complex objectives, and can’t be ordered around or customized
• Balancing issues make some weapons redundant or useless
• Tabbing out of the game at any point causes the game to freeze, and I'm rocking a pretty solid set up



Writing/Lore/Worldbuilding

“In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war”. A historical quote that single-handedly resumes the bleak, brutal universe of 40K; Humanity spans the stars, its society on the verge of collapse and only carried by a fanatically-rooted war economy. SM1’s protagonist, Titus, returns as the main character and is sent on a mission to defend the Imperium; this time around, insect-like Tyranids and the Ruinous Powers of Chaos.

The tale of Titus and his two Ultramarine companions is lore-accurate and engaging — 40K fans will catch many references and bits a newcomer wouldn’t, but that doesn’t make it un-enjoyable if you’re new to the franchise. Characters aren’t one-sided and have solid narrative depth; the feeling of being an important cog of the Imperial war machine — but a cog nonetheless — is conveyed perfectly, as it should be.

Visually and artistically, few games can equal the desolate beauty the game has to offer. From the enormous Tyranid swarms laying waste to all, to the iridescent distortions of Warp powers and the blasts of Cadian artillery, everything looks and sounds amazingly crisp. Settings are varied and rich in detail, with more than a few impressive landscapes. Weapon sounds, dense effects and excellent voice acting only give further emphasis to the action-packed battles you’ll engage in. The gory finisher animations, different based on the enemy faced and weapon used, add great emphasis to the destruction of tougher foes.


Exploration & Secrets

Maps are linear, with one path to follow once either all foes are slain, or certain objectives are completed. Still, exploring the few side-areas, nothing more than crevices or branching dead-ended paths, is worth your time. There, you’ll find precious supplies and uncommon weapons that will improve your survival chances: medkits, Relics allowing you to revive once, heavy weapons and ammunition caches. Lore-related Dataslates also can be listened to in order to better understand the events that transpired. There are no collectibles or proper secrets to mention, nor a map, which you won’t need given the fairly-simple layouts and on-demand objective markers.


Operations (PVE) and Endless War (PVP)

After the Campaign, you’ll unlock several Operations: PvE missions parallel to the main story that depict critical events and feature another Ultramarine team that helped Titus in the main story. Contrary to the campaign, here you'll have access to six customizable classes, each with unique loadout capabilities and Ultimate skills, other than different passive perks and weapons to unlock as you gain XP after an Operation is cleared. Experimenting with different playstyles and combinations, and upgrading your class, adds solid replay value and good progression feeling. These Operations also have progressively increasing difficulty, with better rewards, such as cosmetics, XP bonuses and so forth, proportional to the difficulty you’ll engage into — however, you won't go far in the harder difficulties without better gear and advanced perks, despite all of the settings being available from the start regardless of level.


Content & Replay Value

Average playtime is around 16 hours to complete the game on Angel of Death (hardest) difficulty with two AI teammates, taking extra time to explore all locations thoroughly. After that, Operations and PvP modes greatly extend the content with their high replay value. The story is instead linear, and there’s no reason to replay it except achievements.

The PvP mode, Endless War, has Chaos forces face the Space Marines in a variety of objective-based modes, ranging from the classic Deathmatch and CTF to more nuanced ones. It allows full loadout customizations just as in the PvE mode, and is a nice addition for those interested in competing against other players to test their skills.



Conclusion:

Do I recommend it? Absolutely. Even if you’re not a 40K fan and just enjoy action games, this is a solid pick. Even better if you have two friends to tag along; the best experience is in co-op.

One of the best WH40K games ever made. Not only it surpasses its predecessor on all fronts, but also sets a point of reference for modern co-op-focused action titles.",2024/9/6,en

Начну с того что визуал в игре просто сказка,и я говорю не толька за техническую часть но и за проработку локаций,все сделано максимально детально и круто,давно я так в игре не залипал на задники честно.

Гемплей тоже максимально прост но от того не менее зрелищен.Мясистый ближний бой а так же неплохая стрельба дают нам почувствовать свою доминацию над другими на все 100%.Игра не длинная и гемплей просто не успевает надоесть,вы кайфуете до самых титров.
Сюжет обычный,без каких либо замудрений,прост до безобразия но подается шикарно в виде хорошо срежиссированных роликов и диалогов по ходу миссии,поэтому меня вполне устроило,я не ждал от этой игры какой то драмы или интриг.

A single ranged unit should not be able to spam the entire field with no cooldown with a slowing, damaging, blind debuffing aoe's without any limit. Who thought this was a good idea when they spawn in multiple almost all the time? Range units are still and always will be a unbalanced mess in this game since they will always have free damage against you at any given time since you can't block or counter them except for 2 specific classes, and the infinite green sacks of poop is just crossing the line.
Zoanthropes Zoanthropes Zoanthropes. You dont have krak grenades? You dont have a sniper? You just spent 15 minutes without a single ammo cache or drops and now you have to melee these things that literally makes it impossible to do anything except dodge constantly since two of them stagger unparryable AOE attacks... except oh wait, they are flying 100% of the time and you can't melee them. I guess I will just quit mission cause the game just threw not one but two unfair enemies that alternate invincibility just because. Just pure design fail. Did I mention they also buff all enemies around them on top of everything I just mentioned? At least Neurothrope is fair and actually has sensible mechanic to kill them with melee. Players should be able to actually overcome all enemies without relying on pure RNG to even have a fair chance to progress at all.

Nihoggr,1,168,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991079583/,"Fans waited 13 years for this but incredibly, the game makes you feel like the wait was worth it.
Space Marine 2 is few in flaws and has plentiful amounts of awesome sections and details. The gameplay in Campaign and Operations feels very smooth and highly responsive. Control inputs won't force you to lock into an animation while fighting, so you can be swinging a melee combo one moment and in the middle of that press key to parry an enemy, and the animation will snap smoothly to parrying from what you were doing earlier.
Visually game is very impressive as well! I only spotted one pop-in in 18 hours and one model missing in Battle Barge (which was fixed by forcing a reload of environments). Some of the architecture in Battle Barge and Hive City is up to par when compared to what we got in Space Marine 1 and it was also stunning sometimes to walk around and admire the scenery developers had come up with.
Voice acting is perfect! It took me a few moments to get used to Titus' voice but it wasn't long when I was able to identify Chairon and Gadriel also while fighting Tyranids.
From acting I should move on to writing: as a lore nerd I found this game to be a great representation of canon lore, I felt a sense of brotherhood with Chairon and Gadriel, some dialogue made me genuinely laugh out loud and the final boss had couple of line deliveries that really worked for me (""pearls of wisdom"" bit etc.).

Pour moi c'est un bon jeu mais pas a ce prix la ( a sa sortie)
une campagne des plus classic voire meme old school ce qui peu etre un parti-pris ! mais apres je trouve que certains points négatifs ressorte a mon avis
- les maps PVP franchement tres banals tres fades sans interets pour moi
c'est un jeu qui aurait meriter de s'inspirer de ce qui se fait de mieux dans sont genre une bonne dose d'inluence a la overwatch aurait été je pense un bon moove
- le PVE quand a lui a sa sortie a par une campagne d'une douzaine d'heure et d un mode operation avec seulement 6 cartes qui reprennent les carte de la campagne c'est vraiment tres tres tres leger je trouve !!
au regard de la licence et de l'inepuisable lor on pourrait clerement et objectivement s'attendre a mieux
car oui certain try-hardeur en quelques heures ont deja poncés tout le contenu ( co-op compris )
c'est un jeu au vu de sa richese ou on aurait pu s 'attendre a des maps ouvertes avec vehicules ect un peu a la destiny !
bref il y aurait encore tant a dire
esce que je conseil ce jeu OUI mais attendez une baisse de prix ou que le contenu soit fortement ettoffé je doute que vous surviviez et moi le premier a plus d'une centaine d'heure a son contenu actuel sans passé a autre chose une fois que vous aurez debloqué 60 % du jeu le répétitivité et la rejouabilité auront raison de vous rapidement !

Графоний, локации, пушки, враги, музыка. Музыка уже в начале до мурашек пробивает. Явно разрабы максимально заморочились, что бы не допустить отрицательного успеха первой части :-) И ведь справились! Значит есть шансы и на продолжение, и не через 10 лет :-)
Сюжет тут представлен в формате рассказа об одной спецоперации. Так что каких то глубоких мыслей и не пытается донести. Чисто история про небольшую войнушку на три планеты. Для лора вахи, это небольшая война :-) И крутится всё вокруг глав персонажа 1 части и продолжает его историю.
Но поскольку мы пришли сюда не сказки рассказывать, а умерщвлять ксеносов и еретиков, игра нас этим и снабжает, в первую очередь. Во славу Императора!
Добавили режим операций, в которых рассказано что делали неписи в кампании за кадром. Играть можно в кооперативе, а можно и самому. Ну и мультиплеер в наличии, если он кому нужен.
Минусы есть конечно. Она у меня периодически вылетает. Так же начала постоянно отваливаться в одной операции, поэтому не прошел ещё, жду патчей. В кампании не очень понравилась идея с хабом между миссий, т.к. хаб этот просто набор коридоров. Есть там конечно какие-то активности, если ты догадаешься до них дойти:-), но они не столь значительны, что не особо вижу в нём смысл. Если бы игра шла бесшовно от миссии, к миссии просто через катсцены, я бы даже и разницы не понял.

Что можно сказать, это ОГРОМНОЕ событие для вахаебов, а как оказалось и не только, игра повествует тебе поверхность вахи иллюстрируя жестокость и бюрократичность мира, декорации сделаны на отменном уровне, анимации восхитительны (хоть порой и однообразны), сюжет для вахаеба посредсвенный для рядового геймера хороший-проходной.
ПВЕ операции сделаны паралельно сюжету, это отличный ход, диалоги между персонажами четко прописывают их характер, баланс приятный, хотя на 4 сложности и плотные мобы, но кто мы такие чтобы не превозмочь.

DIPER / PHXNKWAVE,1,13.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DipeRteg/,"Своё знакомство с игровой вселенной ""Молота войны"" я начал еще в далёком 2007 году, с игры ""Warhammer 40 000 Dawn Of War"". Несмотря на то что в то время я не очень любил стратегии, игра мне зашла. Главным образом из за эмоций и драйва которые она даёт. Даже при игре с ботами, баталии в игре были довольно насыщенные. Однако последующие части, по моему мнению, оказались довольно скучными, даже несмотря на то что были добавлены новые расы. Мои интерес к этой серии игр стал угасать.
Заново распалить его смогла игра ""Warhammer 40.000 Space Marine"" вышедшая в 2011 году. Зашкаливающий уровень драйва, линейное прохождение, хороший сюжет без лишних заморочек. То что нужно отдохнуть после работы часок другой за прохождением игры.
И вот теперь довелось мне поиграть в ""Warhammer 40.000 Space Marine 2"". Признаюсь, были опасения что вторая часть игры, как это часто бывает с ""Молотом войны"", будет на порядок хуже первой. Но как говорил один киногерой - ""Я некогда так не ошибался"".
Начнём с того что разработчики не стали заново ""изобретать велосипед"". По сути перед нами тот же ""Warhammer 40.000 Space Marine"" только неимоверно, а главное грамотно, улучшенный. Перед нами тот же капитан Тит (только во второй части он лейтенант). Наша задача без лишних заморочек идти вперёд и уничтожать на своём пути всех кто хочет уничтожить вас. Главными врагами во второй части являются тираниды. И если орки из первой части на вас бежали десятками, то тираниды на вас будут бежать сотнями, от чего уровень драйва взлетает до космических высот. Так же как и в первой части на вашем пути встретятся силы хаоса, во второй части представленные ""Тысячей сынов"".
Визуальные и звуковые эффекты, тут как говориться - ""Моё почтение!"" игровой мир не выглядит таким пустым как в первой части, здесь гвардейцы не стесняются использовать военную технику, да и много други визуальных фишек, а иллюзии ""тысячников"" выглядят просто бомбически.
Сюжет как и впервой части, достаточно интересный, встречается много фишек, и персонажей из книг,

любители ""вахи"" я думаю оценят.

В общем писать про эту игру можно очень много, но как говориться: лучше один раз увидеть чем сто раз услышать. Всем любителям драйвовых шутеров советую в нее поиграть при первой возможности.",2024/9/20,ru

-2 kişiyken operasyona girmeye çalıştığınız zaman yanınıza bot veriyor, lobi sahibiyken girerseniz yanınıza 2 bot veriyor.
Belki ayarlarımdan online kapalıdır veya odam sadece arkadaşlar içindir diye düşünüp ayarlara baktığımda öyle bir ayar bulamadım.

-Oynadığınız sınıf ne olursa olsun otomatik eşleştiğiniz zaman bir anda istemediğiniz bir sınıfı oynuyor bulabilirsiniz kendinizi.Bunu umarım değiştirirler ben bulwark oynuyorsam veya seçtiysem beni bulwarkın olmadığı bir lobiye atsın ben boşuna seçmedim class'ı sonuçta.

-Operasyon modunun zorluğu:Operasyon modlarının zorlukları ciddi düzeyde artıyor orta seviyeden sonra özellikle hissediyorsunuz oyunun zor olduğunu buna nazaran karakterinizin direncine dair herhangi bir artış söz konusu değil.Silah upgradeleri gibi Armor upgradeleri de olsaydı dedim kendi içimden oyunu oynarken, hatta direkt silah mekaniğinin aynısını armor için uygulayabilirlerdi daha güçlü armor daha güzel kozmetik açılışı daha sağlıklı olurdu bence.

-Operasyon modu inanılmaz az ama oyun yeni çıktığı için çok üstünde durmayacağım umarım ilerde daha fazla mapler gelir ve çeşitlilik olur.

-Yaratıkları öldürdüğümüz zaman üzerimize sıçrayan kanlar keşke hep üzerimizde kalsa zamanla gitmemelerini isterdim en azından heal kullandığımız zaman kanlar temizlense çok daha güzel olurdu çünkü kan içinde olan zırhımız azıcık sakinlikle parlamaya başlıyor tekrar ve o kısmı çok beğenmedim umarım dikkat ederler o noktaya.

The entire theatre is much more ""alive"" than before, very often you will fight side by side with the guard, see wonderfully made models of tanks and listen to rousing speeches by devout soldiers of the Emperor.
The atmosphere is top notch, how everything sounds too and executes look nice again.

The campaign is very well done and fun to play, with GREAT surprises and events that are really cool.
Seeing the swarms of Tyranids on the screen is astonishing.

There is a problem with playing the campaign solo tho.
It is entirely possible to play the campaign on Veteran, solo, but for a first time playthrough i highly recommend against it.

I assume they balanced the Veteran campaign around at least 2 humans playing, which is tremendous fun for sure,
but solo quite some things are not difficult, just frustratingly stupid because the AI is very limited.
I can imagine double Zoanthropes are much less of a hassle, even on vet, with at least 2 ""real"" players.
The ranged damage received is through the roof too, which could be a numbers problem,
or because the ai has such poor target priority.

I have a Keyboard issue where my current input is being shut off randomly.
It happens when i walk/run or zoom in to aim. The character stops in his tracks / no longer zooms in until i press the button again and its making it very difficult to enjoy the game. It happens during fights, it happens when i have to walk somewhere.

Its NOT my keyboard, it works perfectly fine with other games, including Space Marine which i re-played tuesday and wednesday. Its only this game.


If you like 40k, Space Marines and good action buy this game and if you are on the fence about it, maybe wait for the first sale.

I have extreme bipolar feeling about this game.Despite the fact that the champion is short and ordinary, as a fan of Warhammer franchise I did enjoyed it greatly. As I finished the champion in 7 hour and started to play the operation mode, the game first startled me with the merely 6 map. After that, I discovered that the time needed to upgrade the character and weapons are enormous. I am wondering how Saber Interactive expects players to enjoy the operation; by repetitively farming the same map over and over for hundreds of times? Not to mention finishing one map costs about half an hour. I am not even gonna talk about the absurdity of some of the game design as many have pointed out in depth.

- DoW 1, просто хорошая игра, на мой вкус все еще лучшая ртс, фанаты старкрафта сосать
- Space Hulk, добротный кооп шутер на 4 человека, стрельба сочная, визуал сочный из минусов, невозможно играть без команды в 4 человека
- Rogue Trader, Игра совокотиков..... Что? Да на этом все, просто классная рпгшка
- Spacemarine 1, я хочу прийти к каждому ютуберу и затолкать им язык в очко. Буквально, спаси марину 1 это ХОРОШАЯ ИГРА, не ""Хорошая игра по вахе"" *эстетствующе попил чай оттопырив мизинчик*, а хорошая игра, добротный визуал, достаточно динамичная боевка, справедливая сложность

Так же я считаю Сейберов крутыми челами, у них все игры имеют мою оценку: неплохо+

Итого ожидания были довольно высокими так как это игра по моей любимой, хоть и с проклятыми играми, франшизе, да плюсом разработаная нашими слонярами

Ближе к делу
Сложность: Пиво-СЛОЖНА СЛОЖНА БЛЕАТЬ СЛОЖНА/СЛОЖНА СЛОЖНА БЛЕАТЬ СЛОЖНА (2-10/10)
Сложность очень приятно скейлится со сложностью, так и с прохождением. Первая сложность не представляет никакого челенжа, но на ней возможно получать кайф от РЕЗНИ, Средняя же сложность на мой взгляд достаточно справедлива и хорошо учит основным механикам игры, после средней сразу можно идти на максимальную для челенджа
Изменения которые вас ожидают с сложностями:
Увеличение бюджета игрового директора
Увеличение скорости его накопления, замена где-то пятой-четверти врагов на элиток
Увеличение частоты появления боссов и минибоссов
Рост хп и урона врагов
Уменьшение количество хилок,уменьшение восстановления здоровья от них
Уменьшение числа боеприпаса, гранат
Короче веселье) Как человек прошедший все миссии коопного режима скажу так, предмаксимальная сложность, убивает внутри, а максимальна ВЫСОСЕТ ДУШУ. При этом в коопе вам обязательно нужно иметь в команде Бастиона, потому что на данный момент это единственный персонаж у которого есть прямой отхил всей команды, остальные персонажи так не могут

Спаси марину 2/Крайзис 3, 11/10
Буквально, самое красивое что было создано человечеством. Божественная работа с арт дизайном.
На болотах мира смерти Кадаку реально сексуально, особенно когда ходишь по полю брани, толпища терранидов рвутся в окопы со всех щелей, ужасающие растения преграждают пути, величественные строения механикус возвышаются над этим всем показывая что даже в самом ужасном месте человечество способно построить храм своему величию.
Аваракс же мир улей, гигантский город-небоскреб путь по которому поражает архитектурой, все кричит о том каким почтением пользуется космодесант у простых жителей, можно только думать о том, как много народу жило в этом месте, для кого и для чего построены широчайшие дороги.
И вот мы на мире-могиле Димериуме, вся планета - большое захронение, и еще более иронично то, кто же обитает под поверхностью планеты.
Текстуры же, если вам не достаточно детализации, скачайте 4к текстуры.
При этом всем, игра довольно оптимизирована. У меня на i5-11400h, RTX2050 и 4GB 16ГБ оперативки, на средних фпс не падает ниже 40

- Товарищ звуковик... Мое почтение... Звук сочный, мощный. Звук попадания в голову мммммм, лязг при хотьбе, крики культистов, все что связано с боль оружием и ближним боем.
- Озвучка на руском, ммммм оаоаооа, кайф, дредноут, хелбрут, все десантники и отдельно Нозик, вы круты

Сюжет достаточно функцианальный, но и не без вотетоповоротов. Но вот катсцены и сюжетные моменты ОООООО, поставьте мне момент с дредноутом и хелдрейком на репит
Отдельно выскажусь о людях, которые не поняли кто есть кто и что тут происходит... Ну тут в целом для прям ну недалеких многое объясняется в тупую... Типа, а вопросы типа ""А почему к Титьке так странно все относятся?"" есть один очень легкий ответ, это вторая часть, слава императору сейберы сделали именно Спаси марину 2 и в ней учитывается спаси марину 1 и даже местами вспоминаются события прошлой части, тоже могу сказать про отсылки к первой части, типа бабули-капитана гвардии, я в какой-то момент прям подумал что это дамочка из первой части

+ Геймплей, классный, сасный, динамишный, мили боевка вкусная, стрельба прям вах, мобы мерают с соком, бьются круто.
- Есть класс без которого нельзя, но без него в целом можно жить
- играть в соло невозможно
Невозможность играть в соло легко пофиксить. Дайте возможность менять конфигурацию отряда ботов в арсенале, которая будет условно привязана к уровню соответствующих классов у игрока. Таким образом:
1. Болванчики не будут абсолютно бесполезными
2. У игрока появляется мотивация вкачать все классы


1. массовый отхил, щит от выстрелов, высокий урон в ближнем бою, высокий хоть и не долгий урон в дальнем бою в соло таргет, отхил брони от самого факта карающего выстрела, пассивка на уменьшение скорости потери оспариваемого здоровья, доступ к лучшему оружию ближнего боя (меч), пассивка на инстакил элитки раз в 2 минуты, пассивка на ваншот мелочевки в радиусе при любом парировании, полный рефлект урона при парировании (ты можешь убить босса буквально ни разу не ударив)
2. Высокая мобильность, бафф всех защитных механик для себя (увеличение окна идеального уклонения и парирования), возможность взять воскрешение раз в 3 минуты (я умирал за часовую миссию в среднем 3 раза) или же вместо этого отхил на 10% за убийство элитки (их будет много) ), доступ к лучшему основному дальнему оружию (мельта)
3. Универсал, доступно все основное оружие кроме снайперок, и тяжелого (в любом случае берешь мельту). Абилка на ваншот карающим выстрелом под абилкой. Просто без минусов, потому тут
4. Доступна тяжелая мельта и плазменный пистолет, буквально лучшее сочитание оружия, АХАХХАХА ТОП ТОП МАЛЫШИ УМИРАТЬ. Много пассивок на щит, которые дают какую ни какую живку.
5. Снайперки наносят урон.... Все, он не веселый, снайпер в игре про ближний бой
6. Ну... У него веселая абилка, веселый молот, вроде может хилиться. Нет нормального дальнего боя, нет возможности драться в толпе, короч если у вас друзья уже крутые и справляются сами, можете взять побалдеть.
Касательно фракций... Я ненавижу стрелков в этой игре, просто от того, что если ты не бастион, ты ловишь гарантированый урон. Ладно бы он был не большой, но словив один залп на высоких сложностях ты остаешься где-то на 10% здоровья... Итого с терранидами драться прям ну в сотни раз веселее чем с Хаосом... Прошу ребят из сейбера, сделайте что-то с интелектом стрелков... Вы бы просто знали какой тильт ловишь от того, что подошел к стрелку в ближний бой, а эти черти стреляют вплотную... Бытрые атаки не наносят так много урона чтобы враги не успевали стрелять, а тяжелые атаки не сбивают стрельбу. Отдельная терада это простые рубриканты... Это БУКВАЛЬНО ХУДШИЙ ДИЗАЙН ВРАГА ЭВЕР, ЖИРНАЯ, СТРЕЛЮЧАЯ, КОНСЕРВНАЯ БАНКА С ПРАХОМ, которая к тому же одним пинком оставляет бастиону ну от силы 20-30% хп....

Я наиграл 57ч. Компания длится 8ч. Все плюсы минусы я описал а выводы делайте сами. Я считаю что спаси марину стоит каждой копейки, давно я не кайфовал от каждой секунды проведенной в игре, а всем кто дерзнет одолеть игру на макс сложности, Император защитит!",2024/10/27,ru

Just like Hive Fleet Leviathan itself, too numerous to mention them all, so some choice selections:
A campaign that gives a certain someone the redemption they deserve. With some great set pieces and scenes that make you laugh in the grimdark, it is so over-the-top-its-good, as Warhammer should be.
When you're in the thick of it, combat feels extremely satisfying. It rewards perfect plays and brutally punishes mistakes, as it should. Difficulty scales fairly well, but mastering the tools available to you - and knowing your place in the machine - should secure victory even in the most dire circumstance.

②游戏这次的画面规格突出一个资金充足，第一部打兽人其实已经很爽了，但是碍于开发资金以及当时游戏引擎的限制，战场还做得没那么宏大。而这次二代简直可以称作大跨越。游戏美术风格拉满，不管是各种40k背景下奇特的建筑，美妙的宇宙以及亚空间场景，哪怕阿斯塔特本身盔甲的质感都上了一个档次。作为一个锤粉真是走到哪看到那截图欣赏到哪，各种鸡皮疙瘩一身。尤其是那种战场到处对轰配合周围破败宏大的建筑以及美妙的宇宙远景，只能说，太tm浪漫了。基本上游戏不管是卡迪亚军团动员还是阿斯塔特动员，以及各种战场比如逃兵处决这样的细节非常多，很多地方都驻足长观许久。而游戏的战斗玩法其实跟上一部差别不大，还是比较偏向于近战，不过这次增加了近战战斗元素，也更强调斩杀处决影响战场局势了（泰大魔是真的狠，出血量惊人啊）不过难度相比于前作也小有提升，尤其是护甲破碎后，一堆小兵都能让血条瞬间消失。而且游戏战斗虽爽，场景宏大，但是重复兵种打久了还是有点累的，不过流程确实也不长6-7h就完事了。

③同时，这次游戏很强调多人联机元素，这一点有好有坏。好处自然是联机元素的加入可以极大的增加游戏的趣味性以及保鲜期。但是缺点也是很直观的，就是游戏的单机战役因为也可以联机所以很多元素直接按照联机设计了，而游戏的ai又很弱智，卡住是常有的，不干事是经常的，把你气到红温是必然的。制作组对这些元素还是缺少打磨，比如有一关需要调整四个天线，肯定是一个人按机关另两个人掩护，这要是多人肯定不是事，但是如果你单机玩，需要你自己去按老半天机关，ai真就看着小兵打你不掩护，直接让你狂掉血。还有就是后面占点一类的任务，真能把你气吐血。而游戏的pve行动模式，简直是肝帝噩梦，其实这个模式设计很巧妙，pve的关卡是主线战役的另一面，比如主线泰图斯派一个小队去干别的活，这个小队就是你在pve里扮演得了，玩起来还跟泰图斯对话很有感觉。但是制作组可能想拉长游戏时长，这个模式简直肝到吐。游戏几个兵种等级分开算，最高25级，升级技能点需要钱，解锁各种护甲部件需要各37场对局，每个武器分开算经验，护甲的配色也要肝钱，pve和pvp等级还分开的。而行动模式总共也就6关，这要你重复玩几百次，哪怕联机有人聊天也受不了啊。pvp体验也很差，全都只能抱团，没有竞技的感觉，现在甚至还有外挂了（小蓝熊你是真除了增加bug啥用没有啊）。总之游戏质量虽好，但真的还有很多需要更新调整的地方，希望游戏越来越好，赞美帝皇。",2024/9/16,zh-cn

Einige böse Zungen würden das Spiel als einen Ausdruck toxischer Männlichkeit bezeichnen. Ich würde eher sagen, es ist genau dass, was die westliche Spiele- und Filmindustrie braucht.

Da ich bisher lediglich die Kampagne spiele, beziehe ich mich auch nur auf diese.
Space Marine 2 bietet Action und Gemetzel im Überfluss. Wer Spaß an Hack&Slay hat, wird dieses Spiel lieben.
Das Gameplay in der Kampagne ist ansprechend und herausfordernd. Die Steuerung per Maus, oder Gamepad funktioniert tadellos und es wird nie langweilig seine Feinde in wunderschöner Grafik zu zerstückeln.
Leider muss man sagen das es noch ein paar technische Mängel gibt. Zum Beispiel stürzt das Game bei mir immer ab, wenn ich es beenden möchte.
Ebenso fehlt eine manuell Speicherfunktion. Das Spiel speichert leider nur automatisch, an bestimmten Checkpoints.
Ebenso das fehlen einer 21:9 oder 32:9 Unterstützung, verhindert eine noch höhere Bewertung meinerseits.
Doch wer über diese Mängel hinwegsehen kann, bekommt ein wirklich gutes Action Game, welches richtig Laune macht.
Daher würde ich zur Zeit eine 7.5/10 geben.
Alles in allen würde ich mir mehr Spiele dieser Art wünschen. Spiele in denen der Focus auf den Spaß am Spiel liegt und nicht nur auf dem abarbeiten einer ESG Checkliste.


Some evil tongues would describe the game as an expression of toxic masculinity. I'd rather say it's exactly what the western gaming and film industry needs.

Since I've only played the campaign so far, I'll only refer to this one.
Space Marine 2 offers action and carnage in abundance. Anyone who enjoys hack & slay will love this game.
The gameplay in the campaign is engaging and challenging. The control via mouse or gamepad works perfectly and it never gets boring to dismember your enemies in beautiful graphics.
Unfortunately, it has to be said that there are still a few technical deficiencies. For example, the game always crashes for me when I want to quit it.
There is also no manual saving function. Unfortunately, the game only saves automatically at certain checkpoints.
The lack of 21:9 or 32:9 support also prevents me from giving it an even higher rating.
But if you can overlook these shortcomings, you get a really good action game that really puts you in a good mood.
Therefore I would currently give it a 7.5/10.
All in all, I would like to see more games like this. Games in which the focus is on the fun of the game and not just on completing an ESG checklist.",2024/9/7,en

могу с уверенностью сказать, что см2 уже стал в разы лучше чем первая часть. низкий поклон Saber Interactive, за то что смогли сделать игру настолько высокого качества, где отлично выстроен экшн, в котором по сравнению с первой частью, добавили много элементов из прошлой игры сэйбер про зомби, и я ещё заметил что по ближнему бою есть элементы jedi fallen order. по атмосфере, звуку, эпичному появлению Тита - словил трепет. а так же игра очень красивая. выглядит так - как и должны выглядеть игры в 2024. ну и наконец - полноценный кооператив на трех человек. это достойный приемник см1, лично я залип в см2 с кайфом и залипну ещё точно. а Saber уже давно себя зарекомендовали как мастера своего дела, ибо Timeshift - игра моего детства, была ультра отпалированной. как и Will Rock, как и World War Z. поэтому если у вас будут проблемы с игрой, я уверен что их поправят. но лучше в см2 не играть если у вас нет видеокарты на 6 гб и более.

ну и вообще это пока единственный претендент на игру года. в этом году по сути кроме mullet madjack, alone in the dark, hellblade 2 и hades 2 выходили либо римейки, либо helldivers 2 который попутно в кал превратился, либо откровенный кал. единственный кто может реально составить конкуренцию Space Marine 2 - это HMRIH2 в октябре. и всё, тупо без конкурентов, ибо год вышел мега тухлым. но ладно, не ждём а готовимся.

(послерелизное)
пощупал игру полностью, прошёл на ветеране. ветеран - дисбаланс сложность, но проходимо, у меня ушло часов 8 на прохождение. в кооперативе играть плюс минус так же как и в соло, но в режиме операций кооп тащит. мультиплеер так же у игры хороший, чисто классический, без всяких приколов кроме скинов + игры идут быстро (от 5 до 15 минут). в общем кайф шутер, давно не играл в такой бодрый и превозмагающий экшн. но конечно на фоне vermintide 1-2, см мне нравится меньше, ибо не фанат 40к.

""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2"" feels like a breath of fresh air in today’s gaming landscape, crafted by skilled artists and developers who clearly understand the community’s hunger for an unfiltered, raw gaming experience. This game is a love letter to fans, unapologetically delivering a brutal, power-fantasy experience that stands in stark contrast to the tired formulas of modern AAA titles.

In an era plagued by bloated open-worlds, tedious ""complex"" characters, and invasive microtransactions, SM2 stays true to its roots. The result? A fully immersive journey that strips away the unnecessary and focuses on the essentials: visceral combat, duty, discipline, courage, and brotherhood. If you played the first Space Marine, you'll instantly connect with the tone and spirit of this sequel—it's all about men who get the job done, no matter the odds. It is obvious that the setting is taken seriously, and nothing seems out of place, the protagonists BELONG, they are not forced in.

Even though the co-op and campaign content might seem light in comparison to other games, the sheer fun and intensity of the gameplay more than make up for it. And while it's not the biggest game out there, every moment of SM2 is crafted with precision and care.

Whether you’re playing with friends, strangers, or even bots, the experience is consistently thrilling. Kudos to the developers at Saber Interactive for pulling this off in today's gaming climate, and a special thanks to the publishers for respecting the creative vision.

Эзотерические машины поднимались вверх над престолом примарха, при помощи которых его нетленное тело оставалась навечно в ловушке вне времени. Жиллиман спокойно сидел на троне, с закрытыми глазами, и кровью, блестевшей на его горле словно ожерелье. Прародитель Ультрамаринов всё ещё был одет в свою старую, окровавленную и поврежденную броню, которую он носил во время последней дуэли с примархом-демоном Фулгримом. На коленях Жиллимана лежал клинок огромного размера, меч самого Императора. Хотя полубог как будто мирно спал, сила от его присутствия ощущалась неимоверно.»

Царство Ультрамар, также известное как субсектор Ультрамар — феодальная звёздная империя в составе Империума Человечества в Сегментуме Ультима. Правит здесь орден Адептус Астартес Ультрамарины, а глава этой империи — магистр ордена, носящий титул Владыки Макрагга и Владыки Ультрамара.

Отличительной особенностью субсектора является крепкая дружба между местным населением и орденами-наследниками XIII легиона. Во времена Великого Крестового похода родной мир легиона Ультрамаринов Макрагг снабжал XIII легион рекрутами и снаряжением. После окончания ужасных событий Ереси Хоруса кандидатов стали набирать со всех миров маленькой империи. Это пространство и есть Ультрамар, звёздное царство Ультрамаринов.

Ультрамарины — XIII из первоначальных двадцати легионов космодесанта. Ныне один из самых прославленных орденов Адептус Астартес.

Легион Ультрамаринов вёл войны Императора с помощью рассудительности, дисциплины и решимости; каждый воин стремился во всем подражать своему примарху. Этот самый многочисленный из всех легионов космодесанта был давним защитником владений Империума на галактическом востоке.

Замеченные стратегические предпочтения: всеобщая атака, целенаправленное истребление, планетарная блокада, операции по освобождению и приведению к покорности на ограниченном театре боевых действий.Будучи безмерно преданными своему примарху Робауту Жиллиману, Ультрамарины слепо следуют созданному им Кодекс Астартес. Десять тысяч лет они бились так, как описано на страницах этого священного писания. Другие ордены могут с лёгкостью вырвать слова Жиллимана из контекста и подстроить под себя, но только не Ультрамарины. Кодекс Астартес — труд великой мудрости, и эти воины не видят смысла перечить ей. Беспрестанные примеры самопожертвования и самодисциплины позволили жителям Ультрамара пронести священные знания и веру сквозь десять тысяч лет в будущее.

Кодекс Астартес содержит сотни страниц описания для любой мыслимой тактической ситуации на поле боя и множество вариантов решения задачи. Каждый воин ордена заучивает содержание Кодекса наизусть, так что целая рота действует как единый организм. Мудрость миллионов имперских генералов, солдат и офицеров сосредоточена на страницах Кодекс Астартес, в нём воин может найти всё: от геральдики и знаков различия, до инструкции по проведению планетарного штурма.

-The AI don't seem to level or change based off your level or difficulty

-Tyranids call for reinforcements from across the zone, absurdly quickly, and still soak multiple headshots without flinching
-The operations are not consistent in difficulty. I could play average difficulty 3 times and get 3 vastly different experiences in challenge level
-
-Devs are slow to update anything meaningful
-Devs apparently don't seem to communicate on server maintenance. My wife and I were literally at the last health bar of the heldrake and we were disconnected.
-It's borderline impossible to complete the harder difficulties by yourself with said braindead ai without cheesing which is a problem considering weapon upgrades are locked behind finding armory data at these difficulties.
-Probably just my opinion but the Chaos are just boring to fight. They stand around and shoot and that's about it. I know they're supposed to be husks for Tzeentch but they can't take cover? Or use any basic tactics like using high ground or covering their allies?
-A bug I've encountered a lot was my wife would choose Assault (for example), her character would show up on the plane as she had it, then when she would load into the map, she would be a different class.",2024/10/20,en

С самого анонса, в далёком 2021 году, был заинтригован противостоянием космодесанта против пожирающих всё захватчиков из неизведанных просторов космоса - тиранидов. Суровое лицо из финала анонса, с испепеляющим взором главного героя, красноречиво говорило - лучше-бы тебе дождаться релиза рядовой...



Геймплейно игра представляет из себя экшен от третьего лица со всеми вытекающими. Получаем задание и идём прорубать себе путь из точки А в точку Б. Тут отмечу, локации идейно представляют из себя ""коридор"", но разработчик постарался и максимально дал разнообразия на свежем воздухе и минимум блуждания в унылых коридорах заводов(но куда без этого). На периферии периодически что-то взрывается, ломается и происходит разный движ, всячески подчеркивая масштабность происходящего. Благо графика не подкачала и всё смотрится отлично, помогая погружению в происходящее на экране монитора. Арсенал для приведения к согласию точно не поразит ваше воображение, но найти себе по душе нечто режущее, автоматическое или полуавтоматическое вы сможете без труда.

Управление нормальное, присутствуют простенькие комбо для холодного оружия, метки на врагах о блокируемой\не блокируемой атаке. Всё хорошо, но только до момента когда атакующих мобов становится совсем много, всё рискует слиться в кашу и вынуждает делать постоянные кувырки. Сам проходил игру в соло, на ""Ветеране"" и периодически встречались моменты где игра не давала продохнуть, в пати это было-бы не актуально. Болванчики чуть помогают на поле боя, но сильных надежд возлагать на них не стоит. В общем, если не планируете привлекать товарищей к прохождению, неготовы к духоте и вообще просто отдохнуть хотите, то первые две опции сложности будут лучшим выбором.

Так-же отмечу местные кооп PvE миссии - ""Сражение"". Становятся доступны они постепенно, по мере прохождения по сюжету, чуть дополняя основную ветку действий ГГ. Выбираете приглянувшийся класс космодесантника, оружие, уровень сложности и идёте кромсать всё живое с ещё двумя товарищами или рандомными игроками. Очень бодро играется при первых знакомствах с локациями. Параллельно там фармится местная валюта, опыт и уровень нужный для изменения внешнего вида онлайн персонажа, внешнего вида оружия и прокачки дерева перков. Словом - гринд.

Есть ещё PvP баталии, но это уже на любителя. Пропуск этого режима никакого влияния на впечатление от игры не окажет.

Сюжет здесь прост и незатейлив, стандартно стараемся предотвратить катастрофу, но оказывается что не всё так просто и тут могут быть замешаны некие скрытые силы. В самый раз, что-бы не перегружать игрока информацией на фоне происходящего на экране. Время прохождения будет варьироваться в районе 8-9 часов.

По итогу этот проект не идеален и при желании можно выцепить минусы и недочёты, но идеальных игр не бывает. Здесь захватывающая компания позволяющая побывать на трёх мирах и почувствовать себя брутальным космодесантником который превозмогая всё на свете идёт к своей цели. А визуальная составляющая помогает лучше прочувствовать это погружение. Отечественные разработчики Saber проделали большую работу. Уверен, им этот проект стоил внушительных сил и нервов... и они справились.

Unforseen Lemonquences™,1,7.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/evil-lemon/,"I cannot believe I'm about to do this, but I am giving Space Marine 2 a hesitant Upvote. There are some two deal breakers that I seriously hope Saber Interactive fixes. But before we get into it, there is a fat Horus in the room that i need to address first:

Is it woke?
Short answer:
No, . Shut up about it and go cry to Arch about it. It's not an issue the game critically needs addressing at all.

Yes the spooky SBI did consulted on this game, but honestly I don't really see any detrimental influence so far. As for Ultramarines not looking 100% like a wet dream of an Austrian painter, lets be real. Anyone worth their Warhammer 30/40k salt knows that there is no canonical establishment of Ultramarines all needing to look like they came from the Austrian alps singing Sound of Music. Yes, all space marine take on features after their gene father (Rowboat Girlyman in this case), but Roboute's gene has far as lore goes is pretty stable and has few if any mutations.

All Salamanders look like Pele from SMT because Vulkan gene had a flaw that made everyone black with red eyes. Same goes for some others like Night Lords (scary emo goths) and probably Luna Wolves (bald and angry). Some, like the Raven Guard (sad emo goths) are as a result of their planet's environment (Kiavahr being terrible and Deliverance being a literal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a moon) or like White Scars (Mongolians) who not only Oct 7 his entire planet in about 20 solar years, but also recruited people exclusively from the tribe who took him in.

Some Legions (and by extension first founding chapters) like Iron Hands, Luna Wolves, Dark Angels, Emperor's Children, Imperial Fist and famously Ultramarines recruit anyone from anywhere so long as they are worthy. And because their genes are relatively stable, they do not completely inherent ALL of their Primarch's physical traits. Though you'd obviously find more blonde in say, Emperor's Children and Dark Angels than you would any hair on Luna Wolves.

Not exactly, but you racist AND stupid especially if you didn't know the lore, because from your perspective, why would there be an ethnic limitation in that regard? Get out of here with that you donkey.

Now with that out of the way, some thoughts about the game:

1. If you're a 40k buff, the design, scenery, voice-acting, atmosphere, weapons etc are all exactly what you'd expect Warhammer 40k to feel like.

2. Audio design for the most of it is impeccable.

3. Combat is fluid and mostly satisfying with one caveat (will elaborate in negative).

4. Beautiful graphics, even on my 3070ti at high mids it still looks fantastic.

5. Runs very great on my 3070ti, Ryzen 9 and 32gb DDR5. Though would recommend installing it on a nvme ssd to increase loading speed.

6. Only played about 1.5 hours of the campaign, but the lore so far is fantastic. How they speak, the mannerism of the Astartes, the imperials, the mechanicus etc are all as they should be.

1. ESG. This is the biggest middle finger and a complete deal breaker. Nevermind being forced a stealth installation of ESG onto your system, it ironically PREVENTS you from booting the game unless you go into task manager and DELETE ESG PROCESS. How stupid is that?

2. Second deal breaker for many, the FOV is horrible and there is no way to extend it. The space marine model eats 1/3 of your entire view, which severely reduces your peripheral awareness unless you are constantly looking around.

3. The weapons feel less impactful and heavy than they did in SM1. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if some of the weapon didn't feel so floaty/light (but then again, they are being welded by not just space marines, but Primaris so maybe it gets a pass).

4. Some weapons don't sound as punchy as it should be. The heavy bolter for example was defeaning in SM1 and especially in the Dawn of War games. Other weapons like the bolter pistol needs sound louder and more punchy (you are literally shooting a miniature rocket after all, and a normal unaugmented human can barely fire it without breaking their shoulders. Unless you're a Catachan, then you can fire anything).

5. Titus's first voice actor, Mark Strong, was way better than Clive Standen. Don't get me wrong, Clive does try hard and delivers as best he could, but there's something about Mark's voice that really suits a gruff veteran space marine.


Despite my grievance with some of the more creative decisions like the changing of Titus's voice actor and weapons sound/feel not as heavy as the first game, I understand why they did it. SM2 gameplay and combat is much more fast paced and fluid than SM1 ever was. It might be a solid reason, from a technical perspective to not have everything sounding like Ferrus Manus clapping Fulgrim's cheeks on Istvaan V or having the screen shake like it's Armageddon on a Tuesday. I can live with those decisions, not a deal breaker.

What is and WILL be a serious issue, is the presence of and the poor FOV (which can be easily fixed with an update to allow adjustments).",2024/9/6,en

Contra:
kurze Story(6 Missionen die jeweils ca 1h lang sind), kein Widescreen-Support(ändert sich bald schon), erstmal nur 6 PvE Missionen(wieder ca 45-1h lang und an sich gehören sie auch zur Story sollen aber dieses Jahr noch mehr kommen laut Roadmap), falls du auch ne Fps-Ho3 bist brauchst du Lossless Scaling(außer du hast ne 3070+), relativ repetetive ohne Hordemodus, Crossplay führt noch zu langen Ladezeiten, Server sind noch nicht perfekt

D e i m o S,1,10.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DocOfUrBody/,"Приветствую! Этот обзор как обычно для вас подговили я и моя биполярОчка.
Что ж, приступим (необязательно это каждый раз писать, иначе не поймут наверно)
Игра встречает нас сочным графоном и брутальным повествованием(что, прямо всё серьёзно тут, без повесточки даже? удивительно),
буквально уже в обучающей миссии вы почувствуете физическую тяжесть и мощь вашего персонажа.
Всё же вступление достаточно резкое и кидает сразу в бой, так что, возможно, у незнакомых с игрой возникнет множество вопросов.
Этот мир полон собственных терминов и свободных трактовок привычных вам вещей.
Ввиду того, что я не являюсь фанатом вархамера, но я ознакомлен почти со всем лором (да, совсем не фанат, кого ты обманываешь)
всё происходящее на экране является для меня вполне логичным и закономерным, остальным же рекомендую довериться разработчикам.
Они постарались пусть и накатом, но потихоньку рассказать историю попутно с происходящим. (всё равно хочется больше экспозиции в начале)
Но хотя бы пару 3часовых видео про лор, расы и т.д. всё же рекомендую на ютабе посмотреть (или 10, ну хотя бы 5)

Первое впечатление было - как будто взяли 5ыеGEARSы и добавили свою родную технологию Роя.
Также мы пиломечом(пиловинтовкой) режем и кромсаем рой инопланетной чуди(коричневых покемонов).
Вообще игры роднит обилие крутых пафосных роликов и кровавых побоищ на единицу времени. (к сожалению в т.ч. бои - также однообразно)

Поиграли в коопе - игра требует погружения на 40-60 минут на каждую миссию, что даже хуже каток в любую моба-игру, т.к. стоит вас кому-то прервать - сразу всё летит к чертям и играть после пары перерывов уже не хочется.
А поскольку прогресс никак не сохраняется - будете переигрывать всё с начала.
Что опять убивает погружение.
За визуал игра получает 10ку, но за однообразный гирсоподобный геймплей выше 7 не тянет.
Так что играйте на свой страх и риск, лично мне пока дальше не хочется.
Готовьте несколько часов подряд, когда вас не беспокоят (я пока что лишен такой роскоши)
Фанатам Вахи однозначно брать, остальные могут смело пройти мимо или взять Gears5 на распродажах.",2024/10/1,ru

Про плюсы говорить нет смысла, все и так всё видели по трейлерам, что она выглядит потрясающе по всем фронтам и это действительно так, НО, несколько фронтов проиграть умудрились.
Для тех кто собирается играть на сложности ""Ангел смерти"" предупреждение, не стоит того, просто из-за боевой системы. Постоянно будет не хватать аптечек и без смертей пройти даже при всей сноровке просто будет невозможно:

1. Из-за невероятно метких врагов, которые лупят через малюсенькие пиксели, некоторые враги спамят атаками очень сильными, в перекатах\уклонениях\парировании не блокируются такие атаки и либо принимаешь судьбу, либо успел спрятаться. Есть, конечно, две ячейки брони, но их сносят каждую секунду даже после добиваний если ты находишься в куче врагов, которые вокруг кипишат и атакуют кто какой атакой.
Можно было бы еще решить вопрос, если бы добивание особых врагов добавляло здоровья, но оно не добавляет и добивание особых врагов дает ровно то же, что и обычного рядового жука - ячейку брони, которую собьют сразу же.
2. ИИ союзников при игре без друзей просто невыносимо тупой. Добивают противников когда не надо, когда ты сам бежишь добить, либо не добивают вообще пока ты возишься с другими врагами в другом конце арены, он выходит из состояния и продолжает лупить по тебе.
Поднимать решают тебя пол года, даже если их сапог прямо на твоей голове стоит, им по барабану, жди лежи и отдыхай. Они наносят урон и даже помогают убивать, но 99% арены зачищается именно игроком, при должной удаче они помогут процентов на 5 больше, чем обычно.
Понятно, что за игрока играть им давать не надо, но и помощь в таких условиях оказать могли бы, хотя бы аптечки подкидывали бы из ниоткуда во время совсем суровых условий боя.
ИИ обещают подкорректировать в ближайшем патче, но пока это вот так.

Сложность могла бы быть отличной и вменяемой, если бы не эти минусы, которые портят впечатление от прохождения. Не критично, но было бы комфортно играть на ветеране, если хочется не просто крошить, но и сложность покусала слегка. И достижений за ангела смерти не предусмотрено, можно начинать на любой комфортной.

Финальный боссфайт. Относится только к сложности ""Ангел смерти"".
Ну это какой-то кошмар. Во-первых, он очень и очень затянутый и не без превращения босса в обычную губку для урона. Во-вторых, из-за того, что камера не по центру сложности с некоторыми атаками наступают, а урона получать приходится много. Так еще и с какого-то момента босс начинает жестко кидаться эффектами во все стороны и шуметь, а читаемость атак происходит по цвету удара и звуку, что он вот-вот будет нанесен.",2024/9/20,ru

에픽런처+안티치트 2중 A.T필드 결계있음

작년부터 오랫동안 기다린 게임이라, 초반 평가가 박살나지만 않으면 구매하자고 맘 먹었다.
GTX 3070 QHD 게임자동설정, 균형모드로 60~ 80프레임 정도 나와서 최적화는 잘됐다.

요즘 나오는 게임들이 가면갈수록 게임이 어려워지는데, 넓은 오픈월드, 수많은 기믹, 복잡한 스킬트리에 게임을 하기위해서 게임을 공부해야 할 상황이 많은데 이게임은 그딴거 없다.

찢.어.발.긴.다!

전투스타일은 근접 7 원거리 3 비율로 근거리 전투가 메인이고 원거리가 서브인 느낌이 강하다. 왜냐면 근거리 패링시 이점과 처형으로 쉴드회복을 해줘야만 유지력이 올라가기 때문이다.

패링 타이밍과 가드불능 회피 타이밍을 화면에 알려주기 때문에 초보자들이 하기에도 부담이 없다. 오랜만에 날 것 그대로의 액션 썰고, 패고, 쏘고, 찢다보면 전투 그 본연의 재미가 느껴진다. 특히나 보스공격 5연타를 연속 패링하고 빈틈샷으로 뚝배기 깰때는 소울망자가 되버린 착각마저 들게 만든다.

플5시대에 맛보는 플2 시절의 갓오브워를 하는 기분이 난다!!! 사라! 특히 적 대규모 부대랑 싸울때 그맛이 딱 엣날 갓오브워 ㅋㅋ 피튀기고 찢는 상남자 전투

Минус пока что только в серверах, грузит бывает по 5-10 минут, а порой просто не грузит. Такое себе, это рил жирный такой минус. Надеюсь в скором времени фиксанут.
Вообще пока что все радует, надеюсь мнение не поменяется. Русская озвучка особенно порадовала

Kriev,1,76.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kriev/,"Brothers, this game stands as a beacon of the Emperor’s might, a war hymn to His eternal glory.

The campaign of Space Marine 2 is pure cinema, peak masculinity, but in the raw, honorable sense, not the forced ""feelings"" of modern (S o n y) entertainment. It is a worthy successor to the original Space Marine staying true to the true Warhammer 40k spirit, from the grimdark aesthetics and sharp dialogue to the visceral combat and unforgettable catchphrases, this game is steeped in the essence of the 40k universe. It definitively passes the vibe check.

There is no weakness here, no false sentiment, only the unyielding strength of the Adeptus Astartes. This is no charade of emotion from the weakling masses of modern Terra.

This sequel does honor to its predecessor, as any true son of Guilliman honors the gene-seed of his primarch. The game is the very essence of the 40k made manifest.

While fighting through Tyranid swarms, you witness Cadian squadrons holding the line against an unending tide of enemies. These moments offer a powerful sense of scale, while you may be the protagonist, you're just one cog in the massive war machine of the Imperium. The game does an excellent job showcasing the Imperium’s many parts, from the Astra Militarum and their discipline shouting Cadia stands while being charge by a swarm of gaunts, the Admech with their arrogance, disdain for the flesh and their many rituals to please the Machine Spirit to the zealous and fanatic Ecclesiarchy and, of course, the ever-present bureaucratic nightmare of the Administratum.

On the performance side, Space Marine 2 handles remarkably well, even when the screen is full with enemies and chaos. The fluidity helps maintain immersion, ensuring that you never lose sight of the epic scale and intensity of the battles and the scale of the conflict.

The companion AI, while functional, can be a bit off sometimes, often leaving enemies stunned without finishing them off. If you're not there to clean up after them, those enemies will recover and come back into the fight.

The co-op features are well-implemented, allowing you to seamlessly join your friends sessions via Steam or using an invite code. While playing with random players works fine, there are occasional slowdowns due to the lengthy loading screens when joining or leaving sessions. This could definitely be better as it can get a bit annoying.

当然作为一款游戏而言该游戏的手柄对于近战职业适配真的很好，但比较可惜的是该游戏真的不适配近战（近战职业非常坐牢）
这个游戏参考了很多同类型的游戏，包括且不限于战锤40k暗潮，他们拥有同款远程单位设计，最高难度下2个远程小兵就可以两枪一格血，大枪兵一枪格，一秒一枪（远程敌方单位伤害逆天的高）
当然您也不必担心，本游戏所有怪都是复数出现的，不用担心遇不到怪被秒杀的情况。（拥有逆天的数值的情况下还有非常抽象的怪物数量）
如果您好奇，面对这样的人我们拥有怎么的能力去对抗呢，毕竟我们cos的可是阿斯塔特啊，因此我们可以获得至多4张A4纸护盾，来抵御怪物的攻击，对方最普通的杂兵也需要4下才能破开我们的防御，甚至是最普通的远程小兵也需要3只才能花1秒破开您的护盾，我们获得护盾的方式也非常简答，抛去特殊角色的技能只需要您在如潮水般的怪物中不受25秒攻击就可以在接下来的2-3秒回复满您的护盾，期间受到任何伤害都会重新计时，显得您完全不需要此护盾，当然我们也可以使用友谊魔法来快速获得一个护盾，但非常可以的是同一个单位只能有一位人使用友谊魔法，经常会出现一个类人生物满血满甲，冲进怪堆到处找残血队友救命的怪使用友谊魔法，当然您也不必担心，正常情况下您不会匹配到队友的，不过假如您非常不幸的使用了友谊魔法恢复了一点护盾，也完全无须担心，您背后的小怪依旧会在你意想不到的角落使用没有任何提示的攻击去除您的A4纸盾牌或者更可怜肉体（可怜兮兮的护盾机制和可怜兮兮的身体素质）
为了让玩家体验到全部游戏内容，即使您表示不想打高难度只是想体验简单割草，也不必担心，得益于武器升级系统，您也得挑战最高难度，本游戏的天赋升级系统也给了您给多决策的感觉，每一列只能选择一个升级，您可以在三坨臭狗屎里选择最臭的一坨，然后在有需要的地方砍掉相比之下最没有用的四肢，拼接成一个身上带有臭狗屎味且残疾的阿斯塔特cos。（处处受限制的天赋系统）
也许您已经在其他地方了解过这个游戏发现其他人最高难度并没有我所描述的这么困难，但是他们无一例外队伍里都有一把神秘的武器热熔枪，一旦使用此武器或队伍里有人使用此把武器，您的游戏体验会非常简单的获得提升。但非常可惜，该游戏会出现玩一晚上匹配不到一个队友的情况，并且您的人机队友并不会使用此把武器，您的游戏体验只能掌握在自己手里，因此本游戏一半的职业将建议对您开放，如果您非常不凑巧使用的是这一半职业，请从头阅读后再考虑购买，如果您还有一个朋友也选择近战职业，那么恭喜您，您将获得其他热熔枪玩家体验不到的游戏内容，可以体验步步为营策略，以及艰难的推进，然后花40分钟去打赢热熔枪20分钟可以刷完的图，相信我这样下去您和您的兄弟感情将急速升温，两个人直接cos星际战士打一发都比这个游戏体验pve全部内容要久，还更爽！（本人并没有歧视任何热熔枪及热熔枪玩家的意思）",2024/9/13,zh-cn

shizzz,1,17.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/oumu/,"ウォーハンマーゲームあるあるだが、ストーリーや設定についての細かい説明がないため
ウォーハンマー40kを知らない人はストーリーに関しては何となくやっていることは理解できるが何を言ってるかよくわからないことが多いと感じるだろうと思う。
40年以上の歴史がある肉厚なストーリーなので、ある程度は仕方ないのかもしれないが、せめて用語集などがあったら良いと思った。

ストーリーモードは10時間ちょっとでクリアできる
戦闘に関してはTPSだが射撃より近接がメインと感じました。
ゲーム映像PVなどでは出現する雑魚敵をなぎ倒してるが、道中で湧くちょっと強い敵はしっかりパリィ、もしくは回避をしないとガンガン体力が削れていくため、攻撃ボタンを連打してるだけでクリアできるようなゲーム性ではないということに注意。

COOPに関しては2種類あり、メインストーリーも協力プレイが可能だが主人公タイタスと他のウルトラマリーンキャラクター固定のモードとなっており、カスタマイズ性皆無のモードとなっている。
メインストーリーの裏で活躍している兵士視点のオペレーションモードというものがある。
オペレーションモードがオリジナルスペースマリーンの作成、クラスごとの役割、武器成長あり、パークありのモードとなっており、オペレーションモードを遊ぶにはメインストーリーのステージをクリアしていく必要があるため、購入後すぐにオペレーションモードを遊ぶのは実質不可能な状態です。

オリジナルスペースマリーン作成では一部、後継戦団のデカールもしっかり用意されておりシタデルカラーベースで色を選択したりできてよかったが、仕様上ざっくり部位ごとに色を決めたりデカールを決めたりすることが可能なぐらいのカスタマイズ性のため、クリムゾンフィストのような拳だけを塗り分けている戦団の作成はできなさそうでそこは今後のアプデで改善に期待。

Q.スペースマリーンって何？皇帝とは？
A.人類が宇宙進出をするにあたって、様々なトラブルに悩まされていたがそれを指導者としてまとめ救ったのが皇帝。
更に、皇帝自らの遺伝子を使用し人造人間を作成する。
そうして生まれた存在が原初のスペースマリーン「プライマーク(総主長)」
誕生した20人のプライマークたちは保育カプセルに入った状態で、異世界に住む邪神たち""ケイオス""(混沌の神々)の仕業で宇宙に散り散りとなってしまう。
プライマーク達は散り散りとなってしまったが、皇帝はプライマークの遺伝子を元にスペースマリーンを作成する。
皇帝は作成したスペースマリーン軍隊を率いて銀河を統一するための戦争をしつつ、各種惑星で成長した散らばってしまったプライマーク達と再会していく。

Q.なんで同じスペースマリーン同士で戦ってるの？
A.再会したそれぞれ特徴を持つプライマーク達をリーダーとし兵団を作成、スペースマリーンを率いて銀河統一は順調かと思われたが、ケイオス""(混沌の神々)がプライマークの一人であるホルスを唆し大規模内戦が起きる。
ここで9人皇帝忠誠派と皇帝に反旗を翻すホルス側の大逆派9人で分かれる。(20人のうち、残り2名は記録から抹消されている)
通称ホルスヘレシー(40kの1万年前なので30kとも呼ばれる)
ホルスは敗れ、その他大逆派スペースマリーン達は歪み(ワープ)に逃げたが、致命傷を負った皇帝は植物人間となってしまう。
40kになっても歪みに逃げた大逆派は混沌の神々から加護を受けケイオススペースマリーンとして戦い続けている。

Obwohl die Kampagne ein wenig kurz ausfällt und vielleicht in der Zukunft mit einer oder zwei Expansionen erweitert werden könnte muss man sagen das Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 in allen anderen belangen wirklich abgeliefert hat. Die Kampagne ist an Bombast kaum zu übertreffen, die grafische Darbietung ist wirklich optimal in Szene gebracht und lässt einen sehr oft mit offenem Mund einfach staunen.

Die Koop-Missionen machen auch sehr viel Spaß und erzählen die Geschichte des anderen Trupps neben Captain Titus und seinem Gespann.

Die Charakterentwicklung ist bei den Coop-Missionen und dem Multiplayer getrennt und lässt aber viel Spielraum um seinen Wunsch-Marine(oder ein bestehendes Chapter) entstehen zu lassen.Die Waffen levelt man separat durch die Nutzung mit.

Der Multiplayer ist auch schon wie beim ersten Teil damals einfach schönes Beiwerk und kann auch Spass machen wenn man mit den richtigen Leuten spielt. Aber auch wie damals im ersten Teil ist die Kartenvielfalt nicht groß, die Hitregistration nicht wirklich die beste und es kann schnell eintönig werden.

Es muss gesagt werden das zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt noch Optimierungsbedarf nötig ist. Das Game ist strak CPU-lastig und viele CPU´s , besonders Intel 13/14th Generation laufen sehr heiß bei diesem Titel und erreichen sehr gerne Mal ihr Limit. Eine gute Kühlung sollte schon vorhanden sein bis da etwas nachgearbeitet wurde. Undervolting sollte bei diesen Generationen ja schon fast obligatorisch sein.

Aya,1,33.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/flashn00b/,"The Strongest 40K game for the Strongest Day
For anyone with even the slightest interest in Warhammer 40,000, this game's arguably the best Warhammer 40,000 title to release after the bankruptcy of THQ, after 13 years of getting a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that between 2018 and Boltgun's release, the best way to enjoy the Grim Darkness of the 41st Millennium in video games was honestly to create Space Marines in SoulCalibur VI. I'll admit i've only played the first missions of the main story and the co-op campaign respectively, though my first impressions of the game have me confident that I'm gonna get a lot of enjoyment from the rest of it.

Gameplay
Being a continuation of Relic Entertainment's Space Marine, combat is meant to have you split your attention between melee and ranged combat, and I feel like Saber Interactive did a much better job at making melee more viable compared to SM1, and I think the dodging and parrying mechanics were the main things that buffed the game's melee, cuz I remember that using your chainsword in the first game was a very fast way to get got by the Ork Boyz and Nobs, often really only being used in the campaign's jump pack sections.

One thing which I can already tell that people miss is SM1's health system. While I personally don't have issues with how health is handled in SM2, I feel like they could've introduced a temporary health mechanic similar to L4D's pain pills for the executions, cuz the armor blips tend to not last very long in the face of your ankles being bitten by multiple hormagaunts, and fodder enemies can be equated to death by a thousand paper cuts. This is a minor nitpick on my end, though one thing I've found from the first half of the second mission is a harsher criticism.

While other games might enjoy putting the player in a forced turret section, Space Marine 2 has forced flamethrower sections, where the game leaves a Pyreblaster near a door to inform the player that they will have to fight against Rippers, small legless creatures that are about the size of a house cat, but swarm you in the hundreds of thousands. It's annoying enough that firing the weapon slows your walking speed significantly, though the fact that they deal pathetically low damage is needless frustration, especiallly since the smaller mortal-sized flamers have been proven to be effective against Hormagaunt and (former) human alike in other forms of Warhammer 40,000 media.

Moving onto the co-op Operations mode, this to me feels like the co-op experience that fans have been craving since the days of the first Space Marine game. Though I've only really played the Vanguard, I found it to be a pretty solid experience, though I personally wish they added a Firstborn class in the game. To those unaware, Games Workshop has been trying to redesign the Space Marine identity from the ground up, though certain weapons from the earlier days of Warhammer 40,000 are unavailable to the modern depictions of the Adeptus Astartes.

With Warhammer 40K being full of intricate gothic architecture you'd expect to find in a fantasy setting with the first antagonist you fight being a swarm of buglike creatures that hope to overwhelm you with their numbers, I think it's fair to expect a hardware-intense game. With the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X targeting 1440p and 30FPS, it's fair to say that it's a pretty demanding game. I'm personally on a Ryzen 3800X and RTX 3070, and while i'm on 1080p myself, the game typically hovers around 50-81 FPS, though there are occasionally some dips down to 41 in moments of high activity. While demanding, I wouldn't call it unstable since in the 6 hours I've clocked in so far, I've actually only had one crash, which is a huge improvement from how frequently the leaked build would crash on the same machine. I don't think more modest machines can realistically target 60fps without utilizing the game's built-in upscaling options, though I think the Dynamic Resolution option isn't functional.

Those who have spent a lot of time personalizing their Space Marine in the first game are gonna be let down with the second one. With Games Workshop trying to push the Primaris Space Marines as the new face of Warhammer 40,000, the number of options available to customize your looks has been severely neutered, to such a degree they had to make colors and emblems unlockable. It's especially egregious in my personal opinion that the fully sealed Mk X Phobos helmet isn't in the game, since that at least is a callback to the old scowl helmets from the pre-9th Edition days of Warhammer 40K.

While we might never get a chance to beat up those holier-than-thou knife-ears that Guilliman seems so attracted to these days, Space Marine 2 is definitely one of those games where an admittedly painful wait turned out to actually be worth the delay it ate, which is a welcome surprise when you consider that game delays in current year are a sign of the dev team thinking that their game's an absolute dumpster fire, especially with 40K. Do i think that this game will be the standard that other devs will follow when handling the license? Unfortunately, no. With that said, I think the June 2024 leak has proven to be a blessing in disguise, and I hope that Saber would at least consider releasing the prologue and first mission for free as a post-release demo.",2024/9/11,en

个人核心观点
PVE没有让人有割草的爽感，近战兵器手感卡肉严重。
PVP一个完成度连页游都不如的糊弄人的垃圾。
1.先从剧情讲起，这个游戏给人的感觉就是超人三人组，场面确实很宏大，剧情纯纯美式个人英雄片，然后呢？根本看不出来阿斯塔特的战术素养，上司经典以权压人，你有反对意见和提出战术想法就立马脸红脖子粗跟你强调他才是连长，拜托你们是一群以战术策略著称的极限战士啊？然后说说三人小队的问题，战场上枪林弹雨还在那里争论的恨不得要打起来在那里闹脾气，旁边星界军在壮烈牺牲保卫帝国，你们仨隔着闹别扭逞脾气，这特么是那个有战术素养 有政治头脑著称的极限战士？干脆去混沌是不是还能让你们放的更开一点？
2.游戏可玩性，两大模式 PVP和PVE
PVP的问题很大，制作的异常粗糙，跟甚至不如页游的生死狙击这种游戏，就连小地图都没有，这是在当星际战士？还是在当原始人打架？节目UI粗糙跟个页游一样。PVP总体思路就是守望先锋那种每个职业都有技能 然后每个职业都有专门的武器就没有然后了，完全可以学学COD的连杀奖励，再说说玩PVP发现的问题视角抽象，对方一旦飞起来，你人在下面根本没办法抬头去打。
PVE的问题没有PVP大但是也很逆天，以往这类型的游戏要么是近战无双打的很爽手感很好 要么就是能远程收割打得爽，综合起来还不错就比如求生之路，打普通小僵尸血肉横飞 打坦克就紧张代入感，撞人的牛 骑人的猴子 还有AOE会吐痰的 单杀后可以吹牛的witch，星际战士2 有什么？近战割草割不动手感还抽象，爆弹枪的手感和打怪效率恐怕都很难跟得上暗潮四人组，拉高难度后爆弹乏力就更突出了，补给少还打不死人，导致难度没改之前没好兄弟组队只敢跑关。
PVE的机制简直没法讲，枪械类就只有热熔榴弹等离子这三个能玩，近战系统这个游戏的核心大爹系统，整个游戏都是为了这一个玩意生的，因为枪械根本没有专门准备有特殊收益的机制（别跟我说白值这纯纯给热熔的BUG沾到光了),近战武器为了折磨你还专门给你搞了三种形态，分别是回击 均衡 格挡 这三种属性代表就是核心机制招架反击的窗口提升 第一个就是可以延长反击窗口 第二个就是默认反击的窗口 第三个就根本不能反击，制作者给这三个属性的武器给人的感觉分别是除了能高效反击还能给小怪刮痧 第二个中规中矩 第三个看似给了逆天的数值实际上因为不能触发核心反击机制依然还在坐牢，被小怪挠几下半血没了（说还能处决回白值，在怪堆里你只会不断的被打断和武士虫出红刀连死）
你没全解锁完全的技能树或者核心几个职业技能 简直就是在坐牢 说就是你雷锤！哪家PVE一个职业需要频繁释放的技能弄个大CD的？从雷锤入门到手枪精通是吧，前期刮痧的输出 被打断的蓄力 人还在蓄力就已经被远程怪点死了，这是PVE?一个不让玩家爽的割草游戏？",2024/10/10,zh-cn

Арсенал для приведения к согласию точно не поразит ваше воображение, но найти себе по душе нечто режущее, автоматическое или полуавтоматическое вы сможете без труда.

Управление нормальное, присутствуют простенькие комбо для холодного оружия, метки на врагах о блокируемой\не блокируемой атаке. Всё хорошо, но только до момента когда атакующих мобов становится совсем много, всё рискует слиться в кашу и вынуждает делать постоянные кувырки. Сам проходил игру в соло, на ""Ветеране"" и периодически встречались моменты где игра не давала продохнуть, в пати это было-бы не актуально. Болванчики чуть помогают на поле боя, но сильных надежд возлагать на них не стоит. В общем, если не планируете привлекать товарищей к прохождению, неготовы к духоте и вообще просто отдохнуть хотите, то первые две опции сложности будут лучшим выбором.

Так-же отмечу местные кооп PvE миссии - ""Сражение"". Становятся доступны они постепенно, по мере прохождения по сюжету, чуть дополняя основную ветку действий ГГ. Выбираете приглянувшийся класс космодесантника, оружие, уровень сложности и идёте кромсать всё живое с ещё двумя товарищами или рандомными игроками. Очень бодро играется при первых знакомствах с локациями. Параллельно там фармится местная валюта, опыт и уровень нужный для изменения внешнего вида онлайн персонажа, внешнего вида оружия и прокачки дерева перков. Словом - гринд.

Есть ещё PvP баталии, но это уже на любителя. Пропуск этого режима никакого влияния на впечатление от игры не окажет.

Сюжет здесь прост и незатейлив, стандартно стараемся предотвратить катастрофу, но оказывается что не всё так просто и тут могут быть замешаны некие скрытые силы. В самый раз, что-бы не перегружать игрока информацией на фоне происходящего на экране. Время прохождения будет варьироваться в районе 8-9 часов.

По итогу этот проект не идеален и при желании можно выцепить минусы и недочёты, но идеальных игр не бывает. Здесь захватывающая компания позволяющая побывать на трёх мирах и почувствовать себя брутальным космодесантником который превозмогая всё на свете идёт к своей цели. А визуальная составляющая помогает лучше прочувствовать это погружение. Отечественные разработчики Saber проделали большую работу. Уверен, им этот проект стоил внушительных сил и нервов... и они справились.

Ravn,0,25.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119673699/,"Preface before reading, I don't want the game to fail I just think it won't succeed without the heed of criticism. I never write reviews, but this game is being overly praised while being seriously flawed.

Pros:

- Great writing true to the warhammer universe.

- They included many chapters and their heraldry with a great framework to expand upon.

- Everything visually looks wonderful and grim in the best way possible. Not too taxing on my gpu or cpu.
(NVIDIA rtx 3070 ti, intel i9-12900K)

- Similarities and nods to the previous space marine game in the series.

- Audio sounds 'okay' except for the voice act which is superb.

- A fair amount of attention to detail throughout the game which is very nice to see.

Cons:

-Connectivity, nothing more must be said just look at the other reviews.

- Multiplayer being the main staying power of the game feels like an after thought and not fully thought through before implementing it. Of course not everyone cares about the multiplayer, but I see it as what would increase the longevity of the game.

- The melee system overall is very weak, especially in multiplayer. Parrying an enemy doesn't stun or hamper the other player in anyway in multiplayer. You can just wail on them until you when but even that is flawed because you are better off just using your bolter to win melee fights. The firearms do significantly more effective damage and don't lock you in a terrible animation. No aim punch or stagger from melee means closing the distance as a play still is dead, you should just play tactical or heavy every match. Locking your enemy into melee is a decided strategy and is not present.

- Getting kills in multiplayer is extremely underwhelming resulting in both the victor and the defeated just feeling frustrated. It would be rewarding if they care over the execute system from the campaign, maybe give you invincibility frames or just expedite the animation time to leave it for when you have opening for the time it would take.

- It's hard to tell when you are being hit, possible adding armor shift under fire or some sort of light stagger would fix that.

- Hitting enemies doesn't feel nearly as impactful as similar games and for a super human clad in metal. The bolter variants do appropriate damage but it doesn't feel like you are shooting anyone. Maybe this is the SFX department but it just feels a bit hollow.

- Biggest problem with the campaign that I experienced was enemies shooting my teammates and me through the world terrain or cargo containers, anything really it just seemed the ranged enemies could hit you from anywhere through anything. A problem with the engine or the assets I'm not sure, hopefully this gets fixed.

- No friendly fire seems like a mistake, I get its more casual friendly but I believe it does a great deal of immersive damage and also unbalances multiplayer. I can stack grenades on top of melee fights with my teammates just killing the enemy team and also it does damage yourself with some like the shock grenade.

- The physics system needs some work non-static items seem to be near weightless.

- So many great opportunities for fresh game modes but nope they went with the tried and true which is fine. Hopefully they get a little creative with the upcoming modes and maybe pull some ideas from the tabletop.

- A cover system seems not necessary, but would improve the combat immersively and tactically.

Conclusion:

The basics are there but it needs a lot of work, balancing, and straight up system changes. Sadly as a warhammer fan I would have to recommend against purchasing until the game gets some major polishing and a few changes to the core. Multiplayer could be a gem for this game.

El juego es bastante divertido después de unas horas de gameplay, este ultimo lo considero similar al de Gears 1, aunque su sistema de cobertura no existe, tienes un modo de combate en disparos y a combaste cuerpo a cuerpo que son dignos de los Marines de la saga, sus mapas como el juego mencionado anteriormente es exactamente lineal y no un mundo abierto como uno pensaba que iba tener en mente, su campaña comienza demasiado bien tras la continuación de su predecesor pero llegando al climax encontré que solo querían acabar rápido y sin dar explicación incluso disminuyendo su calidad de historia. Siendo que esta parte fue su mayor declive en mi reseña. Lo que mas me encanto es su cantidad de clases para jugar en multiplicador, en la que puedes usar distintas clases para jugar cooperativo o en contra de otros jugadores.

剧情
剧情完整大概7-8H(完整就值得夸奖)但是，作为PVE游戏的前置剧情，推进没有任何人物奖励，却又分4个难度，N3+除了坐牢想不出有什么用，当你怀疑是不是因为人物没有能力点武器没有技能点导致的时候，噩梦开始了-->

开始游戏即默认霸王条款：默认绑定了EPIC在线服务，你必须先下载才能玩，跟EPIC的兼容性不用多说了吧。当年你WWZ在EPIC独占我以为有点啥缘故，结果现在STEAM也搞这些？说起WWZ，这游戏画面表现就像换皮的WWZ一样，处决倒是蛮带感的，但是武器打击感反馈真的是一如WWZ一样绵软，隔壁暗潮真能甩他几条街。武器品质分为白绿紫金，每个品质之下有不同型号的武器，获得经验就能升级，武器升级能有技能点，武器能直接喂材料满级，但是喂出来的武器不涨品质经验，也就是说假如打5把能满品质经验和武器经验，结果现在武器虽然满了你还是得去打5把获得品质经验，品质不升到下一阶你解锁不了更高阶武器，那么直升武器的意义在哪里？？正常游玩到了N3要获取紫图纸的时候你就卡住了，因为你会发现武器升不了阶没有更多技能点加攻击，堂堂雷锤都打不动怪，想蓄力潮能给你直接送走，小怪摸一下掉一格甲，三格甲的陶钢阿斯塔特犹如身披报纸一样脆弱，有的职业还只有两格，再配上超多的远程怪，你要被射爆，尤其打混沌，吃痛了人家直接瞬移拉开位置，喷火开枪，把你像放风筝一样玩弄，你跟他对枪犹如隔靴搔痒，硬得出奇。武器是分点击长按来搓招攻击的，还有在你以为你能爽砍的时候，给你来个QTE，打断你操作的节奏，整场游戏充斥着砍杀、QTE、翻滚，一时之间都不知道这到底是什么类型，而且每个点都达不到爽点。现在能打动怪的有且只有热熔一把枪，但只有三个职业有，而且还是因为有回血BUG，导致有了生存才能继续。
关于网络卡和匹配问题，建议你看看自己的网络或者加速器，STEAM游戏国内没有服务器，非P2P联机需要加速器这个是常识，开个加速器7-80延迟根本不会卡。至于闪退报错就不清楚了，没遇到过。

这个更是重量级，可能由于WWZ内容的匮乏，所以加入了PVP模式来延长游戏时间，但是一场PVP要获胜得有200分！一个人头才1分，就算挂哥一枪一个也得秒5分钟。对的，没错，一天不到就有了。你也能猜到挂哥的国籍。而且还把PVP内容加入了成就，以后通行证获取的皮肤也不知道会不会从PVP中获取。

如果你觉得都是因为我菜导致的，那么请看看著名大佬AVP2的原话：1）武器不平衡，能玩的武器少；2）近战的基础逻辑有问题，收益和风险不成正比（除开个别紧靠机制的打法，比如弹反人盾卫，但是这样打法很单一）；3）PVE开荒过渡期太长，玩家战力提升全靠等级解锁带来的强力天赋，导致前期体验十分坐牢；另一方面，缺乏有一定深度的loot系统，玩到后面你没东西可刷，但是爽杀也爽杀不起来，很难支撑长线运营的需求。

Vývojáři ze Saber Interactive naplnili všechna očekávání fanoušků a přinesli hru, která září na všech frontách. Pokud jste milovali první díl, tento vám doslova vyrazí dech.Jako kapitán Titus, legendární Ultramarine, se vrháte do boje proti nekonečným hordám Tyranidů, a zážitek z každého střetu je monumentální. Hra nabízí dynamické souboje, které dokonale kombinují střelbu a brutální boj na blízko. Mechanika je plynulá a uspokojivá, každé máchnutí řetězovým mečem nebo salva z bolteru je doprovázena neskutečnou dávkou adrenalinu.Graficky hra vypadá úžasně. Prostředí, zničená bojiště a detailně vykreslené postavy dokonale zachycují temnou, gotickou atmosféru univerza Warhammer 40k. Hudba je epická a přidává na grandióznosti bitev. Zvukové efekty, jako řev Tyranidů či rachot bolteru, jsou jako balzám pro uši každého fanouška akčních her.

Příběh, přestože není nejnáročnější, skvěle pasuje k frenetickému tempu hry a nabízí několik epických momentů, které vám utkví v paměti. Ať už jste veteránem světa Warhammer 40k, nebo nováčkem, hra vás rychle vtáhne a nepustí.

„Space Marine 2“ exceluje na všech úrovních – od brutálních soubojů po atmosférické ztvárnění bojiště. Je to hra, kterou prostě musíte zažít. Pokud hledáte čistou, nekompromisní akci zasazenou do jednoho z nejikoničtějších sci-fi světů, je „Space Marine 2“ pro vás jasnou volbou.

Haywire Hayley,0,17.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/haywirehayley/,"I really want to love this game but as someone who's hugely into the Tide games by Fatshark I just don't think I can. It fails to capture the fantasy of being a space marine, in my opinion, and has multiple fundamental issues with its combat system. I think the simplest way to summarise it would be to say that it feels like I'm controlling a cumbersome vehicle that barely responds to my commands as opposed to a superpowered human being.

Skill issue, you might say? Well, no, not really. In fact, one of my main problems is that the (incredibly arbitrary, incidentally) blue parry indicator appears TOO EARLY and if you respond to it extremely promptly then you instead fail the parry and are punished rather than appropriately rewarded. This can be adjusted to, of course, but it feels terribly unintuitive.

That leads me to how only SOME attacks have audio cues and others don't... Why? Darktide has an audio cue for every melee attack made against you, and it feels great. Sound design in general isn't great here, with boltguns almost sounding like suppressed rifles. The gun strike mechanic also feels wildly inconsistent, and there's the lovely fact that your teammates can inadvertently prevent you from pulling these off.

But whiner, why do you keep making comparisons to Darktide? Well, I'd argue Darktide is the best 40k shooter available right now and I don't see any reason to buy this one while it exists unless you truly hate always online components or are one of those (boring... sorry) people who is specifically obsessed with space marines.

PvE operations difficulty is MASSIVELY inflated compared to the Normal mode of the campaign which I picked in the hopes of having a fun power fantasy experience. For the most part, the campaign does an OKAY job of achieving this despite the aforementioned issues - and has some amazing setpieces - but the starting operations difficulty is a mess. You are woefully underpowered for whatever reason and are expected to grind to achieve the physical power necessary to actually feel like a badass as opposed to a worthless chump.

Something is wrong when I feel infinitely more like a space marine in Darktide as my pathetic little stim addict almost-heretic on even the highest difficulty. I've not even mentioned how painfully unbalanced the Thousand Sons are compared to the tyranids. Inconsistency seems to be the name of this game.

I'm entirely unimpressed by the weapon variety seen here. Bolters, bolters and more bolters. Most of the ranged weapons are simply bolter variants, with a few exceptions, and then there's a grand total of four melee weapons. Rather pitiful compared to what's on offer in Darktide.

So, what about PvP? It feels totally slapped on to me. Melee has way less of an impact than I'd expect in a *Warhammer* game, the TTK is stupidly fast for what are supposed to be impressively durable supersoldiers, and I've (I'm NOT exaggerating) not played a single match that wasn't absurdly one-sided.

To me it feels as if they created the 6 - 10 hour ish campaign and then realized that releasing a shooter exclusively comprised of that doesn't exactly fly in the 2024 market for the price of $60; so what did they do? They cooked up a half-arsed PvP mode and a co-op PvE experience with an obnoxious progression system in the hopes of artificially extending playtime and creating the illusion of value. There's only minor enemy placement differences on each replay and no semblance of an AI director so content runs dry quick.

Sounds familiar, actually. A lot like World War Z by the same studio.

That value just isn't there for me, personally. I would pay maybe $30 just to experience the campaign which is visually breathtaking and full of cool moments, both narratively, and from the perspective of sheer rule of cool. But everything else? it's just mid, I think.

Frankly, I don't understand why Darktide was so lambasted for its launch when this game suffers from the same issues of a lack of content, poor optimization and crappy weapons that take forever to tune and actually feel solid. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I really can't find the appeal.",2024/9/15,en

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 робили розробники з Пітера, так, саме ті, чиї родичі зараз вбивають українців, ті, хто зараз донатить гроші на потреби військових злочинців, ті, хто зараз гортають новини і зловтішаються черговим обстрілам українських міст. Ну і звичайно ті, хто безпосередньо допомагає своєї армії у загарбницький війні, наприклад налаштовує обладнання, бази даних, сайти чи активно поширюють кремлівську пропаганду.
Ну і ще

Треба окремо відмітити, що самі розробники лицемірно та боягузливо приховують, звідки вони. На будь яких ігрових ресурсах ру сегменту там всі новини та коменти до них в дусі ""огого ыгыгыгы смагли же наши!!1"". Ну тобто всі все знають, але але при цьому офіційно приховуються за маскою начебто американської компанії. Хоча Saber Interactive це саме болотна компанія. Про це безліч інформації.
Більш детально про розробників можна подивитися тут:

А зараз щодо видавця Focus Entertainment. Цей видавець активно підтримує як інформаційно, так і грошима багато болотних компаній. Так, саме вони видали Атомік Фарт та безліч іншого сміття типу Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 та інш. Саме вони восени 2022 просили вибачення у рашистів, це не жарт, вони реально у Твітери розмістили пост із аквафрешем та вибаченнями, і це саме тоді, коли масово почали обстрілювати міста України. Уявіть собі рівень цинізму!
Про видавця можете детально почути у цьому відео:

Тож висновок простий, не купуйте ВСІ ігри Saber Interactive і бажано також і видавця Focus Entertainment, але з видавцем складніше, бо там є розробники, які ніби то підтримали Україну, ну наприклад розробники A Plague Tale: Requiem.
Також додатково надаю в текстовому вигляді інформацією щодо розробника:



Do not buy this game, the developer is located in the Russian Federation, in the city of St. Petersburg and actively supports war, mass murder, shelling of cities, kidnapping of children, rape, etc.
Every dollar from sales of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is the death of another peaceful Ukrainian.

ZOA,1,33.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zoaasrihtu/,"A fantastic return to form for 3D third person shooters. A glorious comeback for the Space Marine franchise. The beautiful details to the environment, weapons, lore; it's all there and faithful. One of the most fun I've had, I'd dare say the best 40k game to date (makes me want an Imperial Guard game by these guys). A complete package of PvE and PvP with all future content free. The season pass only holding cosmetics. No pesky microtransactions, time savers, or any other games as service BS. The devs listening and bringing updates and changes upon what the audience as a whole seem to resonate with is also a breath of fresh air.

The fact the game can still be played in ""offline"" mode is a godsend in itself and a rarity for many a-game in 2024.

My only real complaints are things that can be changed & fixed with time. The bugs in the experience (I've had a few crashes).
The other is the lack of customization for the Chaos Space Marines minus paints and decals. I do see segments for pre-built armor sets, but who knows, maybe they'll open customization to it in the future if the game continues move forward. This game has 2 million players (and growing) at the time of this review.

Irish,1,15,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028358390/,"Where do I even start. Not sure who started the rumour, but the campaign is not 6 hrs, f that. It's way longer. I've clocked 14hrs on normal difficulty and skipped half the side missions. I'd say 16-17hrs max on normal. This is an AWESOME game. Masculinity incarnate. Ticks all the boxes. Brotherhood, a calling for a higher purpose, good vs evil. This is a blokes game. It will tickle every masculine atom in your body. That's not to say females wont enjoy this game, you will, it just means you're an ultimate badass.

You don't have to be a lore expert here. I myself am a casual warhammer fan. I just know the basics. And you can too, there are many 1 hour videos on youtube that will read you the basics, and get you up to snuff. Watch one of those and your done.

But here's the gist.

Play as a 7ft tall superhuman soldier, a space marine, created by the Emperor himself. It's a grim dystopian future, humanity is in a constant galactic war for it's very survival. A galactic war that has no end. A war that has raged for tens of thousands of years. A war against Elves, Orcs, Machine races, Tyranids (think Alien xenomoprhs), And traitor humans and demons from the realm of chaos (basically a dimension that originally harboured souls of the dead, but became overwhelmed by constant war and death in the galaxy that it is now a twisted dimension of chaos and evil) a dimension that leaks into ours, twisting and corrupting everything it touches.

You don't have to play the first game, but I absolutely advise it. There a more than a few references to it. It's a great game. This series is gonna be huge. So don't starve yourself of any backstory.

As for the gameplay, I suggest playing on normal, any higher and you lose that power fantasy feel and becomes kind of a chore to play. The level design is incredible, better than anything today, seeing the armies of humanity fighting this endless war in the background is incredible, tanks and apc's rolling around, it's so much fun to just watch. You'll really feel like you're playing an important role in this war. It will feel like it's unfolding in front of you. And the downtime on the ship in between mission is just icing on the cake.

It's expensive. But we need to support devs that remember what gaming is about. Appealing to their audience. Not mass appeal and micro transactions.

So, grab you're weapon brother, and get into the fray.

Хвалить эту игру можно очень долго, но к сожалению в ней есть пара недостатков которые могут заставить лишний раз подумать - стоит ли брать?
- На момент написания обзора у игры есть тех проблемы и косяки оптимизации (лично у меня всё было отлично, но вот у знакомых нет)
- Есть проблемы сетевой составляющей, порой идет невероятно долгое подключение по итогу которого тебя просто кикнет и плохо сохраняются настройки кастомизации (банально слетают из раза в раз)
- Цена. Как фанат, я конечно оценил весь контент который мне предложили, но 3к все же многовато для игры в которой контента (без длс и перепрохождений) не так уж и много. Но это поправляется реиграбельностью и интересом самих миссий/операций. К тому же, разработчики планируют вводить такие дополнения и миссии в дальнейшем, что побуждает и дальше играть в этот проэкт.
На этом лично для меня минусы закончились, это отличное комплексное приключение как на одно лицо, так и на совместный замес с 2мя верными друзьями! Операции на высоких сложностях бросают неплохой челлендж, а пвп режим сможет немного разнообразить игру. Очень много внимания уделили и гвардии, фанаты явно это оценят, видно что ребята делали игру с любовью и стараниями, поэтому отдельное спасибо разработчикам за ПОЛНУЮ русскую озвучку, ребят вы лучшие!

А в кастомизации космодеса можно пропасть с головой.

Балансируешь между ближкой и дальним боем, уворачиваешься, парируешь и очень красочно добиваешь.
Просто все бездумно крошить на право и на лево не получится, но и в хардкорную тактику не превращается. Получилось нечто среднее, то что и нужно, чтобы поверить в происходящее и почувствовать мощь космодеса.
Понравились и спецоперации (местный аналог коопа вне сюжетки), где все классы дают почувствовать игру по-разному.

Он просто есть... Ничего особенного, хоть и потенциал классов и прокачки вложили. Карты халтурные, как и режимы. ТТК очень высокое, регистрация выстрелов страдает, убиваешь за стенкой и ты и тебя.

Ну коротко очень. Сюжетка прям быстро проходится, потом только спецоперации и кач.

After putting almost sixty hours into the game, most of that being grinding out xp on the only six limited PVE maps with friends. I could go and pick apart things in the story from the point of someone who knows the 40k universe, of even some story points that just don't make sense. You can find those on your own.
The story was satisfactory, far from perfect, the visuals are fantastic there are indeed moments of awe.. but by and large those appear to be smoke and mirrors.

Even with the souls like punishing combat systems... yes, you play a space marine and spend most of your time pretending to be a rolling pill bug. Hiding behind corners, but only right hand corners as you cannot shoulder swap, or going into melee to parry, parry, parry, dodge, parry.. unless you like getting stun locked or shot while almost to your feet during the standing animation. More to say there but pushing on to the point.

I'm bored with it. Completed the campaign, on vet. Had some fun. Did some grind stuff with the boys. Found out the combat systems in place feel bad. Again explore the reasons if you like there are tons of videos on both the good and the bad already out there.

Ended up going back to Helldivers, and Darktide. Good try Focus, this one should have stayed in the oven. I don't regret playing it, I do regret paying the pre-order price. Darktide holds more value, and much less of a price if we want to compare 40k to 40k games. Even if you rank it at 1 dollar per hour played, I didn't get my value.

I do not recommend this game and here is why:
- it feels bad to shoot any weapon other than melta or charged plasma because they deal no damage, it takes more than a clip from any bolt weapon to throw any medium unit into executable state (way way too long), enemies shrug 30-40 direct hits from HEAVY BOLTER like it was a toy gun
- melee is not fun, you get stagger locked and killed by medium enemies
- it feels bad to use chainsword (thunderhammer and power sword feels better but they are not available on 4/6 of operation classes), you cut down the small enemies, but fighting any medium+ is not fun - they will either dodge or play red or blue with you.
- medium+ enemies in melee stagger you with every hit, but your attacks do not
- enemies like to play with you in red and blue, dodge or parry, do it wrong and you lose 50%-75% of health
- enemies are able to teleport or dodge like 10 meters, your dodge is like 1m
- health and armor system is very badly implemented - SM1 had it much better. You cannot recover health with finishers, only armor, yet you lose armor almost instantly. To do a finisher on enemy you need to hit it real good to recover like 1 armor segment.

It is just not fun to play right now.
I do not want to play a class in operations for 10h before it feels fun to play, I want it to feel good from start and then just get better. Most people will play an operation or two, see it is not fun and leave.

Cosas buenas:


- Los graficos son de 10, me repito, parece una pelicula.

- Fidelidad absoluta a la franquicia

- Jugabilidad y mecanicas


Malas:

- Hay perdida de frames y un uso de CPU elevado que se va a corregir en parches, asi que no es un problema.

- Los colores del pintaejercitos debarian ser gratuitos. No puedo crear a mi capitulo porque el azul que necesito es de DLC. Creo que lo unico de pago debaria ser cosmetico a nivel armadura sin restringir los colores.

- Algunos colores no quedan bien pintados segun que zonas porque el tono no coincide con el color.

- Rangos DLC. Para crear a los tenientes y a los sargentos veteranos necesitas tambien el patron de DLC y no parece justo tampoco. (Me comprare el DLC mas adelante de todas formas)



Cosas que yo metería en el multijugador:


- Que cuando personalices a tu marine los colores aplicados sean tambien aplicados al resto de toda la flota para que de esa forma si tienes un capitulo propio sientas esa inmersión.

- El modo PVP debería tener un PVE tambien desde mi punto de vista porque yo y todos mis amigos somos jugadores PVE. (Esto no es necesario pero si habria mas gente casual que simplemente quiere pasar un buen rato con sus amigos)

H3X,0,66.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/-H3X-/,"Went into this expecting to be playing a game.
At this point it's not a game, it's a chore and I'm disappointed.

The world, setting, etc are all really nice. It's oddly relatively well performing too which is more than can be said for a lot of bigger games in the last five years.

But, it's busted. The enemy AI targets only the player, doesn't take into account the player mechanics - so you're more than likely to end up between getting hit and getting hit, because if you deign it necessary to block, dodge or parry you are also allowing something else to do their thing because they basically ignore the rest of the squad. This extends out of the campaign to bots in the Operations mode, so there's no respite from awful mechanical failure there either. Never mind the minibosses that stunlock you because you miss a dodge and because of recovery animation just wail on you from 100% to 0 with no way to escape due to how the attack chains are set up. Or the lack of indicator on 90% of parry-possible attacks, or the lack of any form of recovery outside of what would be UT99's worst healing pack in a game that a basic mob can stunlock the protagonist. Ugh.

It feels like an attempt to implement an Arkham style riposte system, but it doesn't work when everything you do with it leaves you open to more damage. Why even use it at that point. Stop targeting only the damned player to the point it's not playable. Please.

EDIT:
After more playtime, some time in multiplayer and practice with the game systems;
Still not sure I want to recommend this.

Multiplayer routinely has connection/stability issues which are not PC/ISP connection related from what I've seen, and the combat whilst satisfying at times still has the issues with stunlock etc.

AI squad members (which you unfortunately see often) are also worse than I initially thought in both campaign and online, having no capability to follow directions (such as attack/defend) featured as part of the main UI, no perks in Operations, no proper target priority when picking one out, no damage against actual boss tier enemies, and more. About the only thing they can do properly is fire a weapon at mobs and recover their own health outside of combat, leaving everything for the player(s) to do which can be borderline impossible. They routinely ruin Operations runs for example.

This game has a single player tag on Steam, but truthfully is not one. If you would buy it as a single player game, look into the solo gameplay in existing videos or streams first as it's a bit deceiving to say it truly is a single player title. It's ALL focused on having a (human) group. All of it.",2024/10/6,en

Ich war ein großer Fan des ersten Space Marine Teil entgegen der negativen Kritiken die es damals hagelte! Insofern war meine Freude das es eine Fortsetzung gibt sehr hoch! Leider kann ich diesem Spiel dennoch keine gute Bewertung dalassen!
Es liegt weder an der Technik noch der Atmosphäre, das ist soweit Top und macht optisch wirklich etwas her. Die Beleuchtung, die riesigen Schwärme , die Kulisse, alles sehr schick..ABER...

Diese Spiel schwächelt meiner Meinung nach am Kampfsystem, und das , wo es doch ein Action Game sein soll...
Der gesamte Kampf wirkt einfach extrem ""schwammig"". Man prügelt wie wild, ohne jeden Sinn und Verstand drauf los. Treffer hagelt es von allen Seiten so das mann zeitweise nichts anderes tun kann außer permanent die Leertaste zu spammen. Man hat zu keiner Zeit das Gefühl irgendwie wirklich Einfluss auf den Kampf zu haben ob man nun gut oder schlecht spielt! Es hagelt einen Treffer nach dem anderen und es gibt eigentlich nichts was man dagegen tun könnte. Gelegentlich, wenn man es denn in dem ganzen Gewusel mitbekommt, kann man mal einen Block raushauen. Hier wirkt das ganze dann auch wuchtig, geht jedoch in dem ganzen durcheinander völlig unter.
Ich habe es auf Schwer und Leicht gespielt, und völlig Wurst ob man sich gut oder schlecht anstellt...irgendwie kommt man schon durch! Das erfordert keinerlei Können oder Raffinesse sonder ist schlichtes Tastengehämmere!

Beim ersten Teil war auch ordentlich was los auf den Schlachtfeldern, aber wenn ich hier meine Attacken und Finisher gut getimt habe, hatt ich Einfluss darauf wie sich der Kampf entwickelt! Kämpfte ich schnell, nutzte Betäubungsschläge konnte ich länger im Kampf bestehen und letzten Endes den Kampf für mich entscheiden!

Hier ist es völlig egal wie ich kämpfe, die Treffer kassiere ich so oder so, dann gibt es alle paar Sekunden mal eine Konterattacke und einen Finisher der sich jedoch extrem schnell abnutzt. Diese Konter sind auch das einzige was man wirklich in der Hand hat. 95% der Treffer kassiert man trotzdem ob man nun geschickt ausweicht oder nicht und am Ende kommt man dann so oder so durch den Kampf ohne eigentlich zu wissen wie!

Die Kämpfe sind schlicht viel zu unübersichtlich und man haut einfach wild drauf los mit immer und immer und immer......und immer den selben stumpfen Attacken! Wenn man sich einem größeren Gegner stellt wird man in der Zeit hundert mal von hinten getroffen von Hormaganten die einfach stumpf an deiner Figur ""kleben"" .Die stehen einfach dumm da und man verliert Leben und Rüstung ohne etwas dagegen unternehmen zu können !
Die Schläge sind extrem unpräzise und gehen allzu oft ins Leere. Der Marine stapft dabei einfach schwerfällig vorwärts und haut ein und dieselbe Kombo nach der anderen raus .",2024/9/11,de

i love 40k and have been anticipating this game for so long.

The campaign is short but cinematic AF. Visuals, game play, the sound is all on point!

The PVP just feels meh to me, it doesn't really offer much at the moment.

So the reason i'm on the fence, Whats going to keep me coming back for more?
I mean, i've completed the campaign and the side missions. So basically all that's left for me to do is rinse and repeat on higher difficulties to level up my brother, for what? So i can just log in and be like, wow he looks awesome. For me the eternal war should of been more like a hell divers type of mode, drop in and defend planets from different races. just hoping that they bring in some new modes to keep it playable.

ashax,1,147.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ashax/,"Campaign:
Great Cinematic experience, better with friends, very cool.
Only low point I can think of are the ""Rats"" section of the 2nd mission and some downtime sections from the ""Cave"" mission.

PvP:
It's ok, a bit death-bally and significantly less emphasis on Melee in my short experience with it.
I didn't have much interest in it before and quickly lost interest in it, so I haven't played a lot of rounds nor grind each classes to unlock their other, more interesting weapons.

(Co-)Operations:

Patch 3.0 (2024/09/26) update:

Armor attrition vs Minoris is better which made the melee combat survivability less punishing or gunstrike reliant. Adjusted spawns for the Chaos faction nerfs made it less overwhelming.

Overall an improvement to the push forward combat that plays better and makes you feel more like a Space Marine, but also makes the game easier (which I think is alright as they will add new enemies and difficulty tier).

They also fixed the bugs with the Supply pod full healing characters with +20% max HP passive/ perk and healing past contested health bug with Melta/ Las Fusil/ etc. which is good.

Original Launch review:

Only having 6 missions on launch is terrible, -Tide games and World War Z had more on launch in the past and still needed more content.

Balance seemed all over the place.
At the higher difficulties, there are fewer resources, it felt similar to the tactical survival experience of Back 4 Blood and World War Z. Depending on your build, you want to be thrifty with ammo and to save it for a wave/ Terminus miniboss/ or an enemy calling for reinforcements from an out of reach place.

Enemies becomes bullet spongy at higher difficulties and are more numerous, and Medicae Stims heals less HP. Different weapon types seem to have different effectiveness vs specific enemies. Running away to the next airlock/ elevator to despawn enemies behind you is cheesy and effective, but not fun.

You have to ration your ammo in-between fixed ammo crate placements and try to use melee, the environment, and equipment you find as optimally as possible (explosive barrels, explosive flowers, and level gimmicks such as the fire wall at the end of the first mission or the train diverter control panel in the last mission).

Regardless of the difficulty, missions have RNG aspects to it such as the mid-level events requiring 0-6 (!) sub-objectives to complete.

Perk and class balance seemed to be all over the place, but I need to play more to be sure, and there seems to be some bugs or hidden effects.
Examples for balance stuff:
- Certain classes have ammo generation perks later on in their class (or weapon perk line) which seems to be a mandatory pick compared to the other options;
- Bulwark's 23 perk restores contested health to your max HP which substantially reduces the need for healing items when paired with executions, or allowing full heal + wound restoration when paired with a Medicae Stim.

Also you use the same currency to buy weapons, class perks, and Space Marine Chapter Customization and you always feel poor while progressing initially, with some classes having more expensive weapons (e.g. Assault).

You also need to grind each class and weapons types. You can max out a class to level 25 and still need to level other weapon types, but trying to do it in the higher difficulty sucks because your lower tier weapon is weak, negatively affecting the strength of the team and your character.",2024/9/7,en

Déjà, les points positifs :
-C'est super beau, graphiquement c'est impeccable et le style artistique colle parfaitement à Warhammer 40k.
-L'histoire, bien qu'assez simple (comme c'est souvent le cas dans Warhammer) s'écoule fluidement et on s'y laisse prendre.
-Super état technique, en 4 heures de jeu je n'ai croisé qu'un seul bug : les collègues IA qui spamment les grenades dans l'ascenseur, et encore ça n'a pas duré longtemps.

J'ai fait le tour, oui c'était court, maintenant les choses qui fâchent :
Pour faire simple : Prenez ""Space Marine 1"", retirez tout ce qui rendait le jeu fun et vous avez ""Space Marine 2"".

-On passe de 4 armes équipables à seulement 2, ce qui réduit considérablement les possibilités de gameplay et pose un gros problème sur la gestion des munitions (tout le temps à court).
-Le système d'armure censé protéger ta barre de vie ne marche pas. Chaque barre d'armure encaisse 1 seul coup (et t'en a que 2), alors vu que t'es en permanence en train d'affronter 50 bestioles à la fois autant dire que l'armure elle va pas être active très souvent.
-Le système pour récupérer de la vie est franchement naze : fini les exécutions qui te permettent de régénérer tes HP, maintenant ça rend 1 barre d'armure (Cf le point précédent pour comprendre pourquoi ça marche pas bien), tu ne peux récupérer que quelques uns des derniers dégâts subis et uniquement au corps-à-corps... Rendant tout le combat à distance complètement inutile vu que tu ne peux que perdre.
Alors, ils ont bien mit des objets de soins... Enfin je crois, ils brillent tellement par leur absence que j'ai passé les 3 premières heures de jeu à me demander si ils existaient vraiment.
-En parlant des armes à distance : elles sont toutes A CHIER. Sans déconner, qui a remplacé le Bolter par un Nerf en plastique ?! Même en vidant un chargeur entier (25 coups) en plein dans la tronche d'un seul mob autre que les petites merdes qui rampent au sol... TU LE TUE PAS ! Les armes font des dégâts misérables et ça casse complètement le côté ""Badass"" qui vient avec le fait de jouer un Space-Marine. Je joue un super-soldat de 3 mètres cinquante qui fait trembler le sol quand il marche... Et je me bats avec une arme qui tire des pruneaux secs, paye ton anticlimatisme ><
-Les altérations d'effet aléatoires qui t'empêchent de jouer, genre le poison qui rend aveugle ou l'effet de confusion qui fait que tu perd le contrôle de ton perso, etc...

Combine tout cela en même temps... Et tu peux juste pas jouer : entre les altérations random qui t'interdisent complètement de faire quoique ce soit, la moitié des ennemis qui te rognent ta barre de vie à distance (barre de vie que tu peux pas régen vu l'absence quasi-permanente d'objets de soins et les problèmes de gameplay cités plus haut) et le fait que tu peux pas tuer les ennemis par manque de dégâts et tu as le combo parfait de l'anti-jeu.
Space Marine 1 était un Hack'n slash bourré de testostérone ou tu t'éclatais au milieu d'une marée d'orks...
Space Marine 2 est une punition dans laquelle tu essaie désespérément de t'amuser face à un système conçu pour te ruiner le plaisir de jeu.

Vendu pour 60 euros, j'appelle ça une escroquerie.

Edit : en mode de difficulté basse, le jeu est super sympa et j'y ai pris beaucoup de plaisir... Mais l'histoire devient alors très courte, et les défauts de game-design et d'équilibrage que j'ai décris ici perdurent, même si ils sont beaucoup plus discrets.

Поиграл несколько дней, прошел игру. Мне понравилось. Есть, разумеется, косяки, особенно русская озвучка, местами звучит... Очень странно, особенно в аудиодневниках, но их я нашел не то чтобы сильно много. Можно, естественно, включить оригинальную озвучку, тем более это делается в любой момент игры и никаких проблем, но в суете, которая происходит на экране, не всегда успеваешь все разобрать. Пока по мелочи.
Многие почему-то пишут про какие-то сбои, зависания и все в этом духе. Я с таким не столкнулся, при том что у меня комп не самый топовый, так что не знаю, в чем проблема у остальных. Может приколы с драйверами?
Но была и большая проблема, которую нормально решить пока не получилось. При первом запуске геймпад подцепился нормально и я играл с него, но потом началось какое-то варпово колдунство. Из-за чего приходится каждый раз заходить в настройки контроллера стим и там его выключать и включать. Может быть проблема конкретно у меня, не знаю.

Плюсы:
- команда разработчиков потратила время на изучение лора, модельки космодесантников, врагов и бэкграунд отлично прорисованы.
- катсцены и панорамы хорошо срежессированны, атмосферны и эпичны.
- актеры озвучки хорошо постарались. Озвучка качественная, хоть со звуком болтера и не угадали.

Минусы:
- слишком короткая для своего ценника. За одиннадцать часов вы неспешно пройдете кампанию и все PvE миссии.
- гринд в лейтгейме - на прокачку одного класса потребуется пару десятков прохождений PvE миссий, которых после патча 4.0 всего семь.
- скомканная подача сюжета в кампании. Из-за краткости диалогов и недостаточной экспозиции поведение двухсотлетних мужчин выглядит как детские тантрумы.
- отвратительный баланс - большая часть оружия крайне неэффективна, две трети перков бесполезны, половина классов сильно уступает другой в эффективности.
- периодически в PvE случаются дисконнекты без возможности переподключиться. Пройти почти всю миссию и вылететь в конце без награды - не очень приятно.
- команда разработчиков не умеет балансировать horde PvE, но решительно применяет глобальные изменения. Кроме новой PvE миссии в патче 4.0 буквально нет ничего хорошего. Патронов еще меньше, ХП врагов еще больше, болтеры и ближний бой еще бесполезнее.

Un petit mot pour les expert et les rageux des bad review (evaluation negative) :

Avant de poster vérifier vos pc et laisser la possibiliter de vous offrir de l'aide pour vos soucis en activant les commentaires.

ce jeu demande une configuration avancée, oublier la configuration minimale, un ssd, et un pc avec au minimum des valeurs simmilaire a celle de la recomandation optimale.
si malgré cela vous avez encore des problemes, il faudra regarder ailleur, pour exemple via votre gestionaire des taches pour reperer ce qui prend beaucoup de ressource sur votre machine, voir si tous vos drive sont a jour etc...
ce que je peu dire à titre informatif, le jeu fonctionne super bien, fluide, pas de plantage, configurer au maximum au niveau graphique sans perte de performance et il me reste enormément de ressource libre sur ma machine.

La configuration des bios par les constructeur de carte mere pour les processeurs dernieres generation sont souvent la cause de beaucoup de probleme sur les nouveau pc.(connu chez MSI et Asus, mais d'autre aussi).
Une mise a jour des bios ou le reglage de ceux si sont necessaire pour diminuer la surchauffe et les plantages de vos pc ou pour stabilisé vos processeurs. (recurant sur les processeurs 14 eme generation)

dans vos setting du jeu privilégier fsdr2 et pas le dlss, avoir un ecran à haute frecquence hertzienne n'est plus un luxe pour les dernieres generation de jeu.",2024/9/6,fr

SeiEhrlich,1,36.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052283558/,"Вступление
Space Marine 2 – захватывающее, насыщенное и, главное для меня, не затянутое приключение
как на одного игрока, так и для компании друзей, ибо можно пройти игру втроём. В игре есть три типа контента:
Кампания – история Тита и его двух товарищей;
Операции – дополнительные задания, что повествуют о приключениях других членах отряда, параллельно выполняющих Титу свои задачи. Здесь есть прокачка снаряжения и классов, но не думаю,
что это может прям затянуть, если только вам в душу не запала боевая система, но пройти, как минимум, разок все миссии стоит.
Вечная война – мультиплеер против других игроков, где 6 на 6 работяги сражаются друг против друга. Честно, мне не очень понравилось, ибо я не фанат PvP контента, но не исключаю, что кому-то это нравится.

Игра представляет из себя экшн от третьего лица с перекосом в ближний бой, так как урон
от дальнобойного оружия будет, в среднем, ниже, но и про него не стоит забывать, ибо не всякий враг будет бежать на вас сломя голову.
В ближнем бою вам предстоит реализовывать несложные комбинации ударов и парировать,
но не беспокойтесь, здесь вам не игры и атаку любезно подсветят и дадут достаточно времени на реакцию. Также враги не стесняются применять сильные атаки, которые не парируются,
но от них можно уклониться, однако, где ты мог парировать врага в любой момент анимации атаки вашего персонажа, то уклониться, словно, можно только после окончания анимации, что вызывало у меня проблемы.
Лечить нашего космоморяка, в отличии от первой части, можно аптечками или же успевать восполнять потерянное здоровье за небольшой промежуток времени избиением врага на манер игры Bloodborne.

Графика в игре у меня вызывала восхищение, как и дизайн уровней, выполненных с любовью ко вселенной. Множество деталей в анимации движения персонажей, добивания врагов, покрытие доспехов кровью и грязью – прям восторг. Ощущение от ударов и стрельбы переданы хорошо, а также работа со звуками оружия выполнена здорово, но, к сожалению, враги ощущаются, порой, как губки для урона, что рушит погружение в роль сильнейших воинов императора.

, честно, мне сложно говорить, ибо я не обладаю передовым железом, но на RTX 2070, Ryzen 5 3600, 16 гб ОЗУ с частотой 3200 МГц я получал ~45 кадров в насыщенных кровопролитных боях на Full HD мониторе со средними настройками графики и включенным DLSS в баланс.
В целом, меня это устроило и играть было, вполне, нормально, с учётом общего качества картинки.

Прежде всего хочу отнести сюда работу серверов. Их работа для меня остаётся загадкой. В операциях
со случайными людьми я получал пинг европейских серверов, что вполне устраивало, но проходя кампанию с другом, что живёт недалеко от меня, мог получить аж 600, что приводило меня
в ступор. Так ещё из-за этого звуковая дорожка в кат сценах могла отставать. Скорее всего, данную проблему решили, но я с ней столкнулся и не могу не упомянуть.

Прокачка в операциях, на мой взгляд, затянута, ибо помимо прокачки класса необходимо качать каждый тип оружия отдельно, что выматывает, а ведь оружие подразделяется на 4 класса редкости и вы не сможете столь спокойно проходить максимальную сложность имея первую или вторую редкость в снаряжении персонажа.

Резюмируя, хочу сказать, что игра определённо стоит того, чтобы в неё сыграть, даже если вы не являетесь фанатом вселенной Warhammer 40k. На мой взгляд, можно получить уникальный опыт, который несопоставим с другими играми, разве что только серия игр DOOM приходит в голову, но это чуток иное.",2024/11/28,ru

There will be a TL;DR at the end.

~

The game falls short of its own shadow in many ways.
It is without character development and story
It is without the variety.
It is with a less consistent/polished core loop.

The testosterone filled glory of the combat swells the brain with glee, but dulls after a few hours.

- Controls Are Awkward - KBM is trash, you’ll need a gamepad, although it’s not much better. You never really get used to it.
- Multiplayer Focus - In case you’re here for the campaign.
- - Repetitive, but not bad,
- Not 40k Faithful - Boltguns tickle enemies, Chew Through rare enemies, blasphemous plot, etc.
- Surprise! - It wants to be a Live Service game.
- Unfinished Grenade UI - they seem the same on HUD ?
- Gun Execute is Blah - at the beginning is super cool;not punchy enough, you end up chaining them together over and over to kill 1 guy.
- Ammo? - It is not precious, but it's also not plentiful.
- FOV - way too shallow
- ""Hold to interact"" - ew.
- Buggy - Including enemies shooting through walls, not picking up items, clipping, and more.
- Missing Features - Can’t snap to targets. Needed for controller.
- No squad customization - ???
- No Troop Variety - Never fight beside mechanical troopers or mercs. Sad.
- None of the little soldiers ever survive - :(
- Campaign Overstays Welcome - It's a 5-6 hour experience in an 8-9 hour package.
- Very Stingy on healing - Awkward unlike other games in the medium.

- Bullet Sponge Enemies - Dump 3 clips of bolter ammo into a normal guy’s head.
- Stun Locks - Get messed up and tossed around sometimes.
- Antithetical Dance - Combat stutters and fails to flow.
- No Upgrades in Campaign - All the cools stuff is in Multiplayer.
- Lack Of Mechanical Depth - Tastes like a cake missing ingredients
- Sound is off - voice is especially low.
- Flat characters - Unsurprising and uninteresting.
- No collectables - ????!?
- Health Sponge - Armor is fickle, and your health is constantly chipped down with few ways to earn it back.
- AI allies are goofy - and enemies disregard them.
- Invasive ""Always Online"" BS - Makes it harder to enjoy at times.
- NDA and Information Harvesting - I don’t usually have to sell my soul to play a game.
- Was that my gun? - Non-dynamic weapon models for cutscenes. C’MON IT’S 2024!
- Pinning animations are too long - repeating several times.
- Bosses are boring bullet sponges - Not mechanically challenging, just take forever.
- No Controller Presets where swapping weapons is NOT on the D-Pad - You will be doing this constantly
- Weapons don't feel like wins - they all feel like losers in some way.
- Pathetic weapon variety - They look drab and insultingly similar, they play the same.
- Bosses are normal enemies? - For some they just slap a big healthbar on a normal Elite enemy and recycle others.
- Neutral melee attacks… - cause your character to turn around and not attack where you're facing.

- Solid flow - fans rejoice!
- 2010's goodness - Simplicity!
- throwback - ""Cooridor Shooter"" vibes in a good way.
- Great Enemies! - Tyanid/Zerg foes are super fun to blast away at!
- Looks gorgeous - Pleasing to the senses!
- Music can be inspiring! - Swelling overtones!
- Juicy - Tons of executions and combat punch
- Guns sound powerful! - Even if they don’t do much, you feel like a beast
- Fun with Friends! - Everything is, but this is a good experience to share!
- Satisfying Destruction! - My therapist recommends this.
- Lots of cool locations! - No longer stuck on the machine world of !
- Nerds Rejoice! - Lots of little goodies for 40k fans!
- Lots of variety! - Modes, Modes, MODES! Throwback to 2009 with how much content!

is fun for a time. It’s novel for 40k fans who will enjoy the tropes, much like many star wars folks these days. Hyper dramatic combat loop dazzles at first and fizzles without variety, but keeps you engaged to get your money’s worth. Made me want to read the books, had novel vibes at times in a good way. It's more of the original Space Marine 1 without too much added, and that’s good in and of itself. The game has a AAA look and a mid-range feel; while suffering from the issue of having lots of enemies to kill and not enough resources to do so efficiently.

Brother AWAS,0,146.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198103479992/,"TLDR - The game is great but the initial experience during the early access was atrocious for co-op. I highly recommend it now but I can't leave a thumbs up for paying to play a Beta test for their co-op servers. Co-op was advertised ages ago, it should've worked for everyone in all regions.

My initial experience before the server maintenance:-
Get yer damn co-op servers running. We can barely play together dangit. It has bee 6 hours of being in game, half that time was either me looking at ""Joining server"" or my friend experiencing the same. And when we do play... it's not so bad. Game's pretty fun. But hot damn get the servers workin.

Another 7ish hours later and the co-op servers still suck.
Tried all the possible fixes on the internet and still nothing.
This game was advertised to having co-op so you'd expect to have it on the get go.

After the server maintenance:-
The co-op finally works.
No work around, no fiddling with the settings, just share your code and there's your friend in the lobby. The squad works in all game modes. I'm having fun and I'm enjoying everything the game has to offer and am excited to see what comes next on the road map.

If you wanna know more about the game itself check out the other reviews cause they can probably do a better job explaining it.

With all that said, first impressions count and that initial roller coaster of nothingness still has a lingering impact. We were told we could play the game early if we bought it early. Apparently, that only applied to certain people and in certain regions. Some people got their moneys worth while others didn't. As much as I want to leave a thumbs up for the game, I can't. I can tell you the game's good now overall but that's as far as it goes. I don't usually pre-order games but hot damn it was never bad enough to write a review about it.",2024/9/6,en

UPDATE :
The devs seem to have gotten the message and are walking back the bad changes they made in the previous patch.

🟢Что мне понравилось

✅ Кооператив. Наверное, он во многом делает эту игру. Без него была бы намного скучнее. Я играл КООП с двумя друзьями.

✅ Толпы врагов. Толпы врагов ощущаются и выглядят шикарно. Не то, что в Serious Sam 4 с его системой легионов, которую видели 1 раз за всю игру. Тут толпы прям бесшовные будто бы. Летающие только выделяются. И в итоге если подпустить к себе толпу врагов - будет вокруг вас реально толпа врагов.)

✅ . Атмосферный декор. Довольно статичный. Из взаимодействий с ним тут только разрушение ящиков, активация инфопланшетов и диалоги с фоновыми персонажами, но... В этот раз оно сработало. Возможно, в совокупности с толпами врагов и качественным артом - это сработало и мне прям зашло.

✅ . Она для меня как сама по себе боёвка представляет мало интереса. Стрельбу много где видел намного приятнее. Ближний бой читается не очень. Но зато анимации крутые и вес космодеса ощущается. Так что для ""отыгрыша"" роли с друзьями в КООП - весьма сносно.

✅ . Как писал выше - у этой игры очень качественный арт. Локации рассматривать интересно. Несмотря на то, что события вроде бы локализованы недалеко друг от друга - декорации всегда разные и между ними присутствует контраст.

✅ . Сценарий у игры вполне хороший. Диалоги правдоподобные, в духе вахи 40к. Всё это подаётся с качественными катсценами, которые иногда даже интерактивные.

🔴

❌ . Постоянные дисконнекты с серваком задолбали.

❌ . Враги иногда игнорят укрытия и накидывают сквозь них в дальнем бою.

❌ . Иногда игра зачем-то забирает у меня крутые пушки, которые я нашёл в кампании. И выдаёт что-то стоковое, типа обычного болтера.

❌ . Очень мне этого не хватило. На высокой сложности на аренах часто дохнешь ты или союзники. И рано или поздно, на одной из арен, количество возрождений закончится. И придётся переигрывать с контрольной точки. Будто бы между аренами, после боя, надо эти возрождения регенить.",2024/9/21,ru
Hikarian,0,3.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mehendre/,"Prinzipiell ein gutes Spiel, aber ich kann einfach nicht guten Gewissens Faulheit supporten. Aber was bedeutet das?

Grafisch ist das Spiel sehr gut, kein Meisterwerk aber bedenkt man wie viele Gegner gleichzeitig im Spiel sind is das schon ok. Ich spiele auf 4k mit ner 7900XTX und nem Alienware Oled Monitor. Alles auf max und man hat zwischen 40-80 FPS also sehr gut optimiert. Leider kein HDR support.

Die Story ist halt totaler Schwachsinn wenn man sich mit dem Lore auskennt, der ganze Planet müsste voll von Space Marines sein damit man überhaupt ne Chance hat, aber gut is halt ein Spiel das is auch ok.

Wo kommt die Faulheit ins Spiel? Beim Kampfsystem, eigentlich könnte das ein geiler Shooter sein aber die Entwickler erzwingen einen Mix aus Nahkampf und Fernkampf damit hab ich kein Problem Darktide hat das ja sehr gut gemacht.

Aber hier ist das extrem schlecht umgesetzt, man bekommt nur aufs Maul weil man konstant umzingelt ist das Spiel baut darauf auf das man das aushalten kann, was mich stört ist das die Gegner KI speziell die Fernkämpfer nur und explizit den Spieler angreifen, große Gegner wie der Carnifex können Fernkampfangriffe komplett abblocken, mit 2 Schwertern ja ne is klar. Höhere Schwierigkeitsgrade sind total lame gemacht einfach Gegner hat jetzt mehr HP und macht mehr Damage. Bei den Nahkampfangriffen hat man sich gedacht wenn man nach jedem Hit so ne art Lag einbaut verpasst das den Schlägen mehr Wucht aber es nerft total, aber anscheinend bin ich der einzige den das stört. Fernkämpfer treffen einen auch immer wenn man nicht aktiv ausweicht, also nur in Bewegung bleiben hilft eigentlich nicht.

Im Prinzip ist es WWZ im Warhammer Universum die Tyraniden klettern sogar exakt gleich wie die Zombies wo rauf.

Ich denke wenn man das im Coop mit echten Menschen spielt is es sicher ganz lustig aber mit Bots fallen die Schwächen halt total auf. Wenn man hier keinen Spacemarine spielen könnte sondern das irgend ein anderes Setting wäre könnt ich mir gut vorstellen das das Spiel auch gefloppt wäre.

Objektiv wäre Darktide das bessere Spiel WENN sich Fatshark dazu herabgelassen eine Kampange einzubauen oder irgendetwas mit der Story zu machen.

Fazit: Kann man sich durchaus gönnen, wenn das Geld knapp is auf nen Sale warten das dauert sicher nicht lange kurz vor Weihnachten. Es ist ein gutes Spiel wird dem Hype aber nicht gerecht. Aus dem Kampfsystem hätte man echt mehr rausholen können.",2024/9/7,de

+ Gameplay is solid, brutal, bloody and gives a good challenge on higher difficulties

+ 6 unique classes for PVE and PVP
+ Great optimazation
+ Polished, no bugs ( except Tyranids )


- No Chaos customization in multiplayer, you can only changes their color not a single piece of armor
- Only 3 maps for multiplayer... truly a heresy
- 3 multiplayer modes aren't much better... Team Deatmatch, Capture point and Mobile Capture Point. Truly nothing special.
- For me game takes literally few minutes to quit... faster is just to press ALT+F4
- Though 6 PVE scenarios that we curently have are pretty good, on longer run they will lack replayability

워해머 세계관의 TPS 슈팅 게임 스페이스 마린의 후속작

오래되어서 기억이 하나도 나진 않지만 전작을 꽤 재밌게 했던 이미지가 남아있어서

나름 기대를 하면서 골드 에디션을 구입, 어드밴스드 억세스로 4일 먼저 플레이 해보았다.



오프닝 동영상과 몰려오는 저글링같은 적들을 쓸어담고 나니

게임에 대한 기대가 올라갔지만 그 기대는 오래가지 않았다.



상당히 큰 행성급 스케일 전투와 그에 대한 연출로 볼거리는 꽤 있지만

스테이지의 구성 자체가 이동 - 전투 - 이동 - 전투의 느낌을 강하게 받고

진행에 따른 캐릭터의 성장요소나 스킬 습득 같은 추가 요소들이 거의 없다시피 해서

코어 게임플레이에 상당히 의존적이며 깊이감이 부족함을 느낀다.

적들의 종류나 인상적인 보스전이 많이 없는 것도 이런 느낌을 가속화시킨다.



캠페인에 있으면 좋았을 스킬이나 무기 레벨업은 PvE모드에는 존재하는데

정작 PvE 미션 자체가 6개밖에 없는데다가 난이도 단계를 제외하면

굳이 반복을 해서 플레이할만한 동기부여나 재미를 찾기 힘들다.



그래도 게임플레이 자체가 기본적인 TPS 슈팅 게임의 재미는 충족시켜주고 있어서

한번정도 캠페인 + PvE 미션을 깨는 재미는 있겠지만

요즘 시대에 풀프라이스 (정가 79800원, 4일 먼저 하려면 104800원) 로

이정도 깊이와 컨텐츠는 좀 부족하지 않나 하는 생각이 들었다.",2024/9/8,ko

Skane,1,350,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zlobnyvaran/,"Может перед тем как громко заявлять что МЫ НАВЕРНОЕ БУДЕМ ДЕЛАТЬ ТРЕТЬЮ ЧАСТЬ вы пофиксите проблемы этой? Там сервера подшаманите, добавите озвучек НЕУЛЬТРАСУПОВАРНЫХ потому что ордена вы высрали, а озвучка то осталась, оружия милишного накинете типа топоров и в двуручном варианте накинете. Надо идти по порядку.
В игре очень много не просто спорных моментов, типа баланс игры под кооп, кретинские графики статов оружия, баланс стартового гира в пвп и некоторые классы там тоже. Баланс пве коопчика это отдельный рофл. Опять варящие суп в унитазе кста, капитана сиську не захотели оставить в карауле и сделать сюжет про это, нет опять надо суповарами играть делать суповарные дела ещё и папасмурф будет.
Что сделано плохо:
- Баланс сделан под кооп, боты тупые и делают ничего, чем выше уровень сложности - тем меньше импакта будут они вносить. На самой высокой сложности они понимают что тиранида можно победить только если ты станешь тиранидом. Они просто в толпе жуков чёта фотографируют, перекатываются, кидают абилку в толпу гаунтов, короче очень полезные.
-К челу который дизайнил миссию с антеннами следовало применить дисциплинарное взыскание, спасибо за такую прочность антенн и такой тупняк ботов, которые не убивают гарг. 11 рестартов, потому что жучки погрызли провода.
-Почему асолт в пве просто не может играть пока не выкачается на фулл? Это просто класс смертник. Почему у бульварка помимо его аббилки есть ещё и такие перки, которые позвроляют ему просто станить толпы и убивать их не получая урон, а второй мили класс просто сосёт плотнейший колючий душитель. Ладно бы ощущалась сила с прогрессией, но у бульварка почему-то уровень силы резко повышается на 4 уровне прокачки буквально позволяя щитодебилу контролить толпы и не получать урон и эта ситуация усиливается на 10 и 11 уровнях, теперь парри бульварка уничтожает всё вокруг него, враги стоят в стане, флажок этот позволяет захиливаться на фулл, а у асолта просто пердёжный ранец который не позволяет убивать нормально и по сути это просто ковбой, которому до получения 22-23 уровня следует спилить мушку. Дизайн его абилок просто мусор и реализация ранца в пве просто помойка. Как минимум перк ретивый выпад должен был бы выдаваться на 9 уровне, ну чтоб вровень идти с бульварком как минимум.
-Урон ренжи, сила стаггера мили и скейлы врагов в пве это спидорак.
-Система брони и хп мусор, такой кал в одиночной игре надо было постараться высрать. Это нужно ребалансить, потому что задумка давать точные хэдшотины таракашкам когда их хуилиард вокруг тебя иначе они превращаются в чёрную дыру - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ высер. И ладно тараканы, там хоть через убийство воинов можно толпу разваливать, но с калоситами это не работает и у них есть щитовики, которых надо в мили выбивать щиты, гениально ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Вот если бы за добивание регенился один бар хп и фулл броня, которой на высокой сложности два деления и слетает она за секунды и ценность её просто нулевая, разве что впитывать ренжовые плюхи. Ладно бы это обосновывалось балансом пвп, но в пвп всё просто отлично, по сравнению с пве.
-Разнообразие оружия близко к нулю. Где комбиоружие, не этот потешный болтер+гп, а болтер с плазмой/болтер с мельтой/ болтер с огнемётом? Где цепные и силовые топоры/ двуручные вариации мечей и топоров как силовых так и цепных? Всё что есть это куча каких-то невнятных болтеров, плазма и мельта. И мельта это опять дробовик, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, вот как бы не был плох ЕК мёртвый, мельта там была лучше чем этот пердёжный высер из первого марина который кочует от него по болтгану и сюда вот приехал.
-в пвп у меня есть вопрос только к классу авангарда, который типа профильный милишник, но получает цепную палку только на 11 уровне и к бульварку, который может вечно блокировать ( опять же есть пример ЕК где щит можно было откинуть стрельбой и вечно стоять на точке неполучилось бы), а так получается надо идти в мили его пинать пока тебя его команда растреливает.
-ОШИБКА 142/140 и ещё была парочка, эти две у меня стабильно каждые 10 игр. Спасибо за планы на продолжение, но это вы будете фиксить?
-Где разнообразие орденов лоялов, ладно калоситов сложно/нехотите, но у лоялов нет ни озвучек, хотя бы для первого основания, ни внешки для неё же. Везде эти печати с суповарными букавками, крукс терминатус из длц ♥♥♥♥♥♥ с ним, но остальной эквип СУПОВАРНОНЕЙТРАЛЬНЫМ МОЖНО БЫЛО СДЕЛАТЬ ИЛИ НЕТ?
Что хорошего:
-Окружение на всех локациях сделано просто отпад, можно фоткать и на обои отправлять.
-Анимации тут заебца,приедаются эти добивания конечно, но что поделать.
-пве мисии неплохо показывают сюжет кампании, за одним исключением приятно играются.
-Архимагос Нозик похож на сержжанта Дорнана. И Д И О Т Ы, вы слишком долго шли до генераторов.
-пвп с нулевой прям хорошо играется.
На первых двух сложностях кампанию можно пробежать вполне быстро, я так планшетики собирал. Но всё что выше просто показывает что игру балансили под ♥♥♥♥♥♥ пойми что, эти болтеры стреляющие горохом и какая-то ебанутая тяга к ИДЕАЛЬНЫМ парри и уклонениям превращают игру в щитшоу. Я не жалею ни о чём, ни о предзаказе максималочки, ни о проёбаных 20 часах первого прохождения кампании на максималочке где я откисал каждый энкаунтер раза по 2, потому что вахоёб коренной, седло тёртое. Кооп в каммпании не как фича, а как основа это конечно лютый ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Контента тоже маловато ( имею в виду косметики) для игры за 3к.",2024/9/26,ru

È um pacote completo e me deu muita vontade de explorar mais o universo de Warhammer",2024/9/15,pt
Finzy,1,22.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyfinzy/,"Basing this off of the singleplayer campaign, I'd give this game a neutral review if I could, I enjoyed some parts of it and some parts not so much. First off the game does look and sound amazing and does Warhammer 40,000 every bit of justice it possibly can, there's tons of detail everywhere and the environments and scale of the enemy hordes are seriously impressive. And it's not just a cosmetics thing, you can see the swarms climbing walls and such and you can destroy them. The basic combat once you get used to the parry and dodge system works pretty well and the weapons feel like they all have a use; I tried to use most of the weapons I picked up during my playthrough and there were few straight up upgrades, more like sidegrades.

The structure of the missions is very linear and there's generally very few things to find apart from audio logs. At the start of the game it felt like you got obstructed very often, I kept walking into invisible walls, but I think the game opens up later on more and the midway part of the campaign had the best mission variety. Sadly I think the campaign falls off towards the end, but other than that, I mostly had a good time. I wish the jetpacks would have been used more in missions.

Now onto the things I didn't like; the whole campaign seems designed more for co-op play than singleplayer. The AI teammates are generally very bad at covering you while doing objectives (+ they cannot do objectives themselves), and you'll regularily get pinned down by ranged enemies all the time, so in every encounter you have to hyperfocus the ranged enemies down first because the AI won't be doing that. At first I started the campaign on Veteran difficulty and I found it to be too annoying to complete with the AI so I switched to Normal after a couple missions and had a much better time. But still the squad AI could really be better, the game should offer a more balanced singleplayer experience. (EDIT: This was improved in patches which is good!)

Also (potential spoilers warning), the campaign isn't very long, I finished it in just about 11 hours, while generally taking my sweet time to explore as well. Towards the end it's like they forgot the beginning of the invasion (Tyranids) completely and the ending felt very cliche and Disney like. I did like that they introduced more enemies later on and I'm a fan of different than usual Chaos factions being represented but it felt like there should have been more story missions across all the planets. I know there's the Operations mode and Eternal War, and I expect that'll add a lot more playtime, but the main campaign felt quite short. (EDIT - Operations has been quite fun if a bit grindy, Eternal War is a pretty typical pvp mode and could use more interesting maps and customization imo)

The game ran well on my laptop with an i9 13980 HX, 32 GB RAM and Nvidia 4090 RTX 16 GB; on 2560x1600 resolution I could play it on high settings with ultra textures (without any upscaling), getting between 60-80 FPS. Some of the larger fights dipped as low as 50 but not below that. I'll probably test how it runs at 4K later on but I'd expect it to require some DLSS at least.

I didn't like that the game has no support for aspect ratios other than 16:9, so at 16:10 I had constant black bars on my screen all the time and it should really be fixed as it's a standard feature in PC games. Also, there was no support for inverted horizontal camera controls for gamepad, so I couldn't play it on gamepad since I use fully inverted controls (both vertical + horizontal) in all games I play; another thing that should be fixed and added to options. Had to learn to play on keyboard & mouse instead :p

TL;DR:
Solid gameplay; nice WH40K aesthetic; poor AI and mission design more for co-op; short campaign that falls off towards the end; some annoying missing technical features",2024/9/8,en

워해머팬을 위한 최고의 게임 (판타지 말곤 모르는대 카오스때문에 재밌게함.)

워해머 아에 모르는 분들에겐 크게 추천하지 않으나 이 회사 전작이 월드워z인대 거기서 많이 추가하고 업글한 맛이 있기때문에. 월z 재밌게 한사람은 게임성만으로도 추천 (스토리는 거의 이해안될거임..) 아니면 웅장한거 좋아하거나..

아쉬운점은
캠패인짧고 현재 코옵미션적음(6개) 그리고 코옵이랑 캠페인이랑 따로 적용 외형 아이템또한 적음
코옵 맵또한 캠패인 맵에서 파생되는 느낌(2분대 출격하면 캠패인1 코옵1 이런식)



결론
워해머 세계관을 정말 웅장하고 장르에 맞게 잘 만든게임 그러나 캠패인(스토리or싱글)에만 치중하여 코옵은 기본 뼈대만 만들어 놓은 느낌(외형 맵 무기등.) 신규맵 신규 몹등 로드맵이 현재 나와있으므로 기대해볼만함

Campaing are awesome even if it's just changed Space Marine original campaing.
Like Orks => Tyranids, Nemiroth legion => Thoused sons. LoL.

Ops at first month were cool it was a challenge to master all classes and unlock all avaible weapon and until devs drops patch 4.0 game had some problems but after all problems were are just get stronger.
-Enemies are bulllet sponges and Bolts (That are Mini-Rockets with high armorpiering potention) feels like .22LR on high difficualties cause enemy HP got x4 modifiers but many bolt weapon had only 2-2.5 DMG that just a joke
-Zoantopes became just flying fortreses that can instanly kill you even if you dodge it in right timing. And don't even try to take cover from beam devs think it's good idea to make them go through any obsticale.
-Chaos is just BORING. Fight against ranged enemies with pea-shooter while yjey use .50BMG with Inferno modifiers. This is just a bad joke.
-Ping issue also made ops are more stupid on higher difficulties (on ruthless and lethal we got -35% dodge invulnerability and perfect dodge windows)

PvP also got good potention and again Saber just abondon this gamemode for 3 months.
-No new maps
-No new gamemodes.
-No balance chages (Only nerfs good weapon)
-No shuffle teams after match that makes it's very unbalanced

Почему же оценка негативена.Все просто- нельзя дать нейтральную оценку или хорошо ил плохо.
Но она нейтральна.
Что в игре мне понравилось.
-Добротный шутер, хорошая стрельба.
-Отличные добивания и мясо сочное(если понимаете о чем я).Даже хаоситы хороши хотя многие жалуются на то что в них конфетти.Ребят почитайте лор тысячников или посмотрите и все само собой состыкуется .Тем более мясо у них есть в виде еретиков и рядовых ксеносов.
-Отличный звук и музыка.
-Пафосная компания по всем заветам Warhammer 40000.Продолжение превозмогания ""Капитана Титьки ордена суповаров с унитазной тематикой"".
Продолжение служения космодесантника Диметрия Тита во имя Имератора и своего ордена космодесанта Ультрамаринов. Приодоления рубикона и возвышения до примариса и т.д.
-Красивое окружение и погружение в мрачный мир вселенной.
-Хорошие ПВЕ миссии дополняющие сюжет после ил во время прохождения основной компании.
Чтож пожалуй для меня из приятного всё.
И вот почему этот обзор покамест нейтрально-отрицательный( или нейтральный).
-Весь контент который есть в игре можно пройти за 30 часов.На максимальной сложности, если пробегать на минималки и того меньше.
-Убогое ПВП и баланс в ней.Серьезно Карт и режимов кот наплакал.
-Баланс оружия,Ну ёлки палки, снаряды болтерного оружия это по-сути микроракеты(микро стан и небольое аое должно быть как по мне и количество болтов в голову 2-3 на особую цель). Мне нужно всадить в башку хаосита 20 болтов чтоб он впал в нокаут.На 5ой сложности это нихрена не смешно.Более-менее нормально чувствует себя Хеби болер и хеви болт ган.( ну болтер с ГП мы в расчет не берём это кривое оружие).Нормально болтерное оружие играется у солдата с теранидами т.к. через перк ауспескса идет подсвет при парировании и урон в голову возрастает, хаоситы тебе такой возможности почти не дают.
-Баланс крипов за хаос мое почтение.Когда 2 терминатора выкашивают всю тиму залпами ракет и не реагируют при том на дамаг летящий в них( им просто плевать)
- Новый враг(Биотитан).Разработчики вам самим не стыдно?Это не новый враг, даже как босс он убогий.Как и механика его уничтожения.Я бы понял еслиб добавили мини-босса или особо противника с какой-нибудь механикой, но это просто стыд.
-Дисконнекты через бой. невозможность подлючиться к игре с которой тебя выкинуло. Подключение к серверу не с первого раза.Просто вымораживает.
-Это лично мое хотя кто знает.Хотел сделать космодесантнкика из Deathwatch и понял что геральдика есть не на все ордена для нужного наплечника.Да и отличия других орденов очень скупо представлены.Сложно сделать допустим Саламандру, нет геральдики, шкур и т.д. Даже забавляют некоторые ( это конечно личное дело каждого) ,но космический волк ( по цветам доспеха класс солдат)) в регалиях ультрамарина вызывает только смех.
-Большой пинг как в ПВЕ и ПВП.
-Баганый класс Штурмовика который может сдохнуть от своего же прыжка.

-There's a nice blend of needing to use all weapons at your disposal

Cons
-Friendly bot AI is not the best. They seem to be randomly aggressive and passive at weird intervals.
-The matchmaking system is quite unstable, leading to excessive load screens. I don't actually believe this is a server performance issue, I think it's how the matchmaking system is currently designed. *If a player queues for quick match and...: 1. gets a mission they don't like and leaves the squad. 2. does not want to be a party leader and leaves the squad / quits to title screen. ...this seems to have a direct impact on the players who get pulled into the queue of this player that did not stick around. I believe (not a confirmed fact) this is why we see a lot of ""joining server"" load screens that take a long time. I want to say the game is not optimized for dealing with these scenarios.

Pro/Con
-Ammo economy can be rough in some points of missions and can make progression more difficult than expected. Learning to search crates for ammo and being wise with ammo consumption helps with this.
-There is a strong focus on needing to use the parry system. Some people may hate that, others may not. Once you get the hang of it though, your gameplay improves quite a bit.
-Incoming damage is a bit rough, especially melee attacks, but this does condition you to block, parry, and improve movement more.
-There is an intense amount of grinding needed to achieve progression in multiplayer. Some may see this as a good thing to stay motivated to play, others may think it's too much of a grind fest and not enjoy it.
-Restricting multiplayer play to one class per player. This creates diversity however is an immediate generation of frustration for players who can't consistently play the class they wish to play.

Overall, I am enjoying the game. However, I would like to see some improvements before I feel I can confidently recommend the game.",2024/9/11,en

$150M,1,43.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037123939/,"This game feels like its from a bygone age, one where Microsoft and Xbox were putting up a fight (and maybe even winning) against Sony in the Console Wars. Its great.

An entertaining linear story mode at around 5-6 hours (on Normal mode), though for maximum enjoyment you should have played or at least seen a recap of Space Marine 1. (And/or understanding Warhammer 40K lore)

A 3 man Co-op ""Operations"" mode that sees you play as your own different Marines that you can customize head to toe (from 6 different classes) and go on missions with other aspiring recruits/players trying to level up and score better gear.

Though at the moment there are only 6 missions to complete. They mostly feel good to play through, and multiple runs are needed to upgrade and level up your Space Marine.

(This is also the live-service, seasonal part of the game so expect content updates unless something completely unexpected happens).

There is also a very fun but very dry no nonsense PVP akin to old COD lobbies but without the vulgarities, racism, and probably no no-scopes (yet).

Hope the devs update this ""Eternal War"" mode as well cause there is some good building blocks to work with.

Combat is very fun, consisting of dodges and parries to outmaneuver and counterattack the enemy respectively.

Not too much to learn other than the timings of parries/dodges and melee combos of each weapon but the chaotic horde-style gameplay will still sometimes give you problems even if you have mastered the intricate art of murdering other Alien lifeforms.

2. Стрельба пистолеты болтеры плазма и прочее почти бесполезна. можно конечно ради прикола пострелять но в общем и целом это почти бессмысленно.
3. Сюжетной компании почти нет. Все заточено на не очень интересный кооп. А заставки перед миссией где вы и ваши компаньоны сидят внутри корабля вообще пахнут сессионными поделками.

A fan commented on the game, a game that has such a good start, and cannot be foolishly manipulated like this. You can increase the difficulty, and there are many ways to increase the difficulty, but you choose to weaken the player's equipment or values, saying that it is for balance adjustment. After adjusting, go and see the appearance rate of explosive weapons? Can you check the appearance rate of assault soldiers at the highest difficulty level? Have your production team ever played a game they made themselves? Let's talk about the highest difficulty level and the level of challenge and gameplay. What kind of 'dog poop' rewards are offered for the highest difficulty level? Experience? Everyone can play this game with full level professions and equipment, which can be used to gain weapon experience. I've endured it, but what else is there?? ornament?? What do I need that thing for?? I don't even ask you to come up with a new weapon. Can you create a red weapon data that matches the highest difficulty level and upgrade the weapon to one that matches the highest difficulty level? Isn't changing skin your strong suit? Are you too lazy to do it?? What substantial reward is there without my chicken feathers? I am sick and so bored to go to jail with my friends. After my friends are tired, I am also tired. Another issue is the gameplay and challenge, yes! In order to prevent players from getting bored, you put in a lot of effort to release the entire N5, brushing elites everywhere, swarming insects everywhere, fighting from start to finish, and having fun? Cool chicken feathers! What player are you cutting?? You can stack quantities, and you can also create new monsters, right? You insist on weakening the hot melt, weakening the counterattack, and secretly manipulate the power of the special battle plasma. Disgusting players, you guys are really good at it!!!! Just talking about balance, how many of those funny shotguns can hit N5? Why isn't that balanced? We have to fix that clustering mechanism. There are so many special elites who need special combat plasma or sniper flintlock guns to deal with brain bugs or distant gun bugs. As a result, you give the whole clustering and force the characters in the back row to be bound to the front row. Just kidding! bro！
Also, I am the ultimate player, but! But! But! The game itself is a semi-finished product, and you are so inefficient and perfunctory. Chocolate that was originally like poop can be eaten, but now it's good, now it really turns into poop. The ultimate version player is not human, right? They are all dogs, let you cheat around. I am a fan of the Warhammer IP, I also buy chess pieces and play games. I remember when there were CG short films at the beginning, I was so happy. I waited for this game, but ended up waiting for a bunch of dog poop.",2024/10/18,en

Efendi_,0,76.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004908459/,"Regrettably i am leaving a negative review pointing out the serious shortcomings of Space Marine 2 as a veteran Vermintide/Darktide player who loves 40k lore.

- During the first launch of the game, Epic games online components are installed automatically without a prompt screen. I do not want it in my computer. You have to go through loops to uninstall it. There is a reason why i am using steam and steam only and i want the developers to respect it.
- When compared with Darktide, Dawn of War series and especially Mechanicus, Space Marine 2 has the weakest music OST. Looks like it was not even at top ten of the priority list during development.
- As a cheap attempt, the game is trying to draw more attention by Twitch drops.
- Very terrible companion ai. One of the worst i have seen for years. They do not use their ranged weapons in most cases and run gret distances to melee an enemy regarless of the class. And they very rarely execute a stunned elite enemy who is only two feet away from them. Such a shame.
- No FOV slider.
- Holding buttons to activate the abilities, instead of hitting them, is a terrible design choice.
- Throwing a frag grenade takes two seconds, activating cloak takes another 2.5 seconds. Character gets hit during uncancellable animations. Every movement and ability use feels unresponsive and stiff during the campaign and multiplayer. Runningg gets interrupted for no reason even if you are holding shift and not even hit by anything.
- Uncancellable dodge, roll over and similar animations are the primary reason why i keep dying. Controls feel very unresponsive.
- Boss fights are almost identical. Area attacks such as some form of 3 round mortar shots, melee charge attacks, ranged attacks and one big 3-wave either green or purple wide area attack which can hit even behind cover is the same rinse and repeat mechanic for both tyranid and chaos bosses.
- Melee combat is terribly designed. Interruptions are common and costs the player half of his health points.
- Ranged weapons feel weak. An elite enemy (Not a boss or a lecter) takes 30 to 40 bolter rounds to put down. Crossing bone swords makes the enemy immune to ranged damage even if you hit the legs, head or spray it from sides.
- The enemies i have mentioned above are bullet sponges but a hit from them take out half of your hp.
- Crowd control options are limited to grenades. I suggest developers to play Vermintide and Dark Tide to see how it is perfected during many years.
- There is a hideous terrible jetpack mission. I hated it.
- Multiple 'Loading resources - loading logic' screens.
- Entire multiplayer lobby system has to be redesigned. It is bad.
- You cannot inject your allies with the stimpack you have in your inventory.
- PVP section of the game is the worst. Very unbalanced. Is this game not beta-tested?
- Cheaters are out there already. I have already witnessed speedhacks and maphacks.
- Easy Anticheat is known as how 'Easy' it is to bypass it. A bad choice from the developers.
- The number of the co-op missions is very few. These missions in general feel rushed, unfinished and exteremely repetitive with very little variation. Even the spawn locations are more or less the same.
- Unlocking armor pieces or better versions of the same weapon is very grindy. This is how the game targets longevity.
- The game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly. I do not expect it to have a long lifespan.
- I was unable to pickup some medkits, ammo boxes or grenades even i had the inventory slot available. Pickup prompt was not there.
- Ranged enemies shoot with 120% accuracy and every shot lands perfectly.
- There is a shield or armor mechanic which recharges a specific amount with combo kills. This mechanic is not working as intended and definitely not user friendly.

Cnclusion: 6/10. Wait for a discount or buy the cheapest package if you must. After the hype is dead, the game will no longer be played by most of us. I believe that Space Marine 2 would be a great game if it was released 10 years ago.",2024/9/11,en

Humble Beings,1,32.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HERECATCH/,"Space Marine 2 improves from its predecessors by building up from what made it great for me in the past. Filling the shoes of Titus once more, you are now a Primaris marine (super space marine). Bigger and badder, you and two of your other buddies (coop) or AI companions are required to prune the Tyrannids (think Zerg from Starcraft, but much nastier) and put an end to their invasion.

Using the same engine from WWZ the devs at Saber Interactive have managed to capture what it would feel like to participate in an uphill battle against endless the Tyrannids. With hundreds of enemies on screen at the same time, you are required to use all you have in your arsenal and eliminate the xeno threat in the name of the God Emperor and boy is it intense on higher difficulties.

Though big and bad, you are still only human and while the smaller Tyrannids wont have you breaking a sweat the bigger and nastier ones will. I like how in higher difficulties you are required to time your attacks properly and use your ultimate move strategically to turn the tide against the horde of xenos rushing at you.

Simply put, I like the gameplay in Space Marine 2 as it manages to capture what it would feel like to be a super soldier in the 40k-verse, the small tyrannid variants explode as you stomp and chop your way through them, while the big ones will have you ripping off their heads in an execution style move.

Fun fact, you can literally run through small traitor guardsman and they would explode and turn into paste!

Story-wise it's your run of the mill 40K game, one minute you're dealing with a tyrannid invasion and the next will have you once again dealing with Chaos. It's nothing new, but the presentation is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Thanks to the technology that the devs utilize, the guardsman are in full display here and I was so happy to be able to fight alongside them once more.

So much stuff goes on in the background and in some instances you can even assist the fights that are happening in the background should you wish. It doesn't add anything to the story but it was nice to know that you are part of a larger scale fight and that everyone in the vicinity plays an important role in it.

For those who are worried, yes the game is a sequel but the events from the first game is told to you relatively well and not to mention its pretty straightforward. So no worries on not being able to catch up or anything if you did not play Space Marine 1.

Longevity-wise the game offers different game modes other than campaign such as Operations which is the PVE mode. This mode will have you squad up with pals and/or randoms to level up the different classes and unlock customization options. This customization is also extended to the PVP mode which is fine, I enjoy playing it with my friends and some matches can be quite intense at times.

All in all I think Space Marine 2 is a good game, the presentation is great, campaign was engaging and serving the God Emperor once more has never felt more satisfactory! an easy 7/10 for me!",2024/10/6,en

Really disappointed I have to give this game a thumbs down but Saber is not taking their Steam Deck / Linux player base seriously with the latest patch that has effectively bricked the game for almost all players on that platform. The AVF error bug is preventing everyone in that user group from connecting to multiplayer and the response from the Saber has been 'Wait until winter, Linux is not a big priority right now.'

The replacement of Linux builtin anti-cheat (which worked completely fine in the past) with EAC silliness has caused massive problems.

The Dawn of War series was built around the already long-time established Warhammer 40k IP, but it came out SO GOOD that it appeared to be an even better embodiment of the setting than the ""original"" itself. And so, paradoxically, GW started to take insipration from DoW themselves, further developing the 40k setting as we know it today.

And I think that Space Marine 2 is yet another brilliant game like this. One that takes inspiration from the 40k's unique atmosphere, but nails it so well, that it will now determine the development of the IP for years to come.",2024/9/9,en
Azrek,0,63.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004429967/,"I want to like the game, I really do. It just seems very flashy with no substance. Some of the kills or combos are great, but beyond that there are only 7 maps which play pretty much the same over any over again.

Customization of your guy ranges from a Bolter that does no damage, but fires fast to a bolter that does a slight bit more damage but fires slower to stabby bits which are either dull, weak, or useless. You will have moments where you feel powerful then go back to dumping 49 bolter rounds into 1 enemy who then proceeds to murder you completely unaffected by the weapon.

You cannot interrupt enemy attacks, moves, or critical strikes, but they can interrupt yours. The best thing to do is use the Codex Astartes approved front flip instead of movement because it makes you practically immune to all damage and you can't outrun anything anyway. I recall reading this in much of the lore on how Horus kept front flipping to get away from Sanguinius till he saw 1 opening to win. It is like having the high ground except you look silly. 90 enemies shooting at you? Front flip till you get behind cover! Melee guys all over you? Front flip away till your team can help you. I believe this move was covered in Chapter 27 of the Codex Astartes to include perfect form, how to properly tuck in your belly, as well as not get your giant nuclear backpack to get stuck on rocks.

Your Emperor approved Power armor is great except occasionally you'll get tangled up in those weeds in your garden you can't seem to eradicate or random dudes firing flashlights at you to great effect. It makes you wonder how some Astartes can become veterans as it seems everything can hurt us greatly. ""I fought in 100 campaigns! I was the first one shot in each mission and had to rest behind a rock till it was over, now I am the Captain because everyone else died 20 seconds later screaming something about glory. They made really attractive corpses though.""

I suppose the game has some potential, though it isn't as customization as Darktide, Rogue Trader or Daemonhunter. Most the Astartes will look the same though in different colors. Or your weapons look like they belong in a BDSM dungeon you have to sign a waiver for to get access.

If they can get the wonky controls fixed, some power to our weapons (or give us more powerful weapons with more enemies), and some more maps this game has some potential. Right now it is good for about a month then off to something else.",2024/11/7,en

Resumen:
Un juego como los de antaño (que tampoco hay que irse muy lejos), con una historia fenomenal, tiros a mansalva, mecánicas muy difíciles y a veces frustrantes, pero que una vez superas el nivel de gratificación es elevado. Su historia, es espectacular y que todo warhammero o fan de la acción disfrutará y la caracterización de los personajes es sublime, como debería ser en todos los juegos.

Historia:
Simplemente brillante, aunque no seas un fan de warhammer 40k y vengas a buscar tiros, la historia y como se va desarrollando de cara al final es exquisito, el poder vivir las conversaciones del capitulo entre soldados, la nave, su jerarquía, el resto de facciones que aparecen, personajes excelentemente bien definidos y maduros (en esta epoca woke de agenda 2030 donde todos son adolescentes y los hombres no son hombres es extraño, por eso hay que recalcarlo). No esperes nada más, acción a raudales como cualquier Gears of War lo fue en su momento y a disfrutar como un enano.

Gráficos:
Espectacular es quedarse corto, a medida que avanza la historia y las particulas van tomando más papel, la experiencia de cada nivel va en aumento. Los tiranidos son geniales y las misiones contra ellos también, pero de cara a la mitad/final toma otro concepto. Además el poder vivir la batalla en pleno terreno con los astra militarum y el resto del capítulo es increible. Super inmersivo.

Jugabilidad:
Aquí es donde puede fallar, SM2 el juego te introduce la idea de jugar en difícil y con los 4 tips que te dan de forma bastante regular hace que sea muy frustrante, cuesta mucho pillarle el tranquillo al juego y saber cuando defenderte de los 4 tiros que te pegan y te dejan en el suelo. Pero admito que de cara a la mitad cuando ya podía entender como jugarlo empecé a disfrutar muchisimo. No te esperes una nueva invención, pero dentro de su simplicidad es justo lo que vienes buscando, acción, tiros y matar tropecientos enemigos.

Importante:
Nada de agenda politica feminista en el juego. Los hombres son hombres, las mujeres mujeres y la historia se centra en eso: Warhammer 40k, no de quién es mejor que otro o como un género se cree otro. Es como eran los juegos hace 5 años antes de toda la agenda política. Aquí te puedes sentar y DISFRUTAR de una aventura de acción. Lo que temo es que de cara al próximo le vayan a meter agenda, así que igual estaremos disfrutando del último titulo de occidente que es para la gran mayoria del mercado.

the dodge indicator shows up got disappears before the enemy has even done the attack, leaving you clueless to when to actually time it correctly. Same goes for the parry indicator.

Campaign is about 10-12hrs give or take (at least it's twice as long as the first game).

The Multi player Pve missions are fun and tie in well with the Campaigns story.

Season Pass for 40€, you wot m8?

Never tried the PVP, but i'm not a pvp player and it looked just like the first games PVP.

Now should you buy this game?
If you really really enjoy the story of the Ultramarine Titus, then yeah sure buy it.
If you really enjoy Left 4 Dead playstyle games, Then yeah sure buy it.
BUT I would storngly urge you to buy it on a big sale, I got 16hrs out the game after doing 4 PvE missions, and the campaign on Angel of Death difficulty. It isn't value for money unless you buy the game for the PvE and PvP mode.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – A Brutal War in the Grim Darkness of the Future! (ฅ'ω'ฅ)

""An exhilarating, gory, and action-packed sequel that lives up to the scale of the Warhammer 40K universe, but with some notable flaws in balance and technical polish.""


Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 thrusts players into the brutal and unrelenting world of the Warhammer 40K universe, continuing the tale of the Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. Developed by Saber Interactive, this third-person action game places you in the superhuman armor of a Space Marine as you combat the horrifying Tyranid swarm in intense, blood-soaked battles. Building on the success of its predecessor, Space Marine 2 offers solo and co-op gameplay, featuring both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes to keep the action fresh and chaotic.


The moment you step into Titus' power armor, the scale of Space Marine 2’s combat becomes apparent. The game’s standout feature is its seamless combination of gunplay and melee combat, allowing players to switch between devastating bolter shots and brutal close-quarters executions. The spectacle of mowing down endless Tyranid swarms is both thrilling and terrifying, thanks to the sheer number of enemies onscreen, powered by Saber’s Swarm Engine.

The visuals are equally impressive, capturing the grim, gothic aesthetic of the 40K universe. From the ruined hive cities to the expansive battlefields littered with the corpses of xenos and humans alike, the game never shies away from its dark atmosphere. The orchestral score and guttural sounds of bolters firing and chainswords revving heighten the sense of chaos, making every battle feel cinematic.

However, the combat system, while exhilarating, does suffer from balance issues. Melee attacks dominate the battlefield, often making ranged weapons feel underpowered, particularly when faced with larger enemies. The tactical depth you'd expect from wielding the mighty bolter or plasma gun is somewhat diminished by their lack of punch, especially when it inexplicably takes a full magazine to down a basic Tyranid warrior. This can lead to frustrating moments, especially for players who prefer a ranged combat style.

The co-op and PvP modes are a welcome addition, extending the game’s replayability. Operations, the co-op missions, allow players to team up with friends to tackle harder challenges, but the real test comes in the PvP mode, Eternal War, where teams of Space Marines face off against the forces of Chaos. Both modes offer progression systems with plenty of unlockable perks and cosmetics, though the limited variety in mission design can make long play sessions feel repetitive.













Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers on its promise of fast, bloody, and exhilarating combat in the vast and unforgiving Warhammer 40K universe. The game’s atmospheric design, gripping story, and expansive multiplayer modes make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and action games alike. However, the imbalance between melee and ranged combat, along with some technical glitches, prevent it from reaching its full potential.

For those who love diving into the lore of Warhammer or who are looking for a gory, action-packed co-op experience, Space Marine 2 is a solid recommendation. Just don’t expect a perfectly polished experience or to rely heavily on your bolter.

I will post a deeper review but right now this is unplayable for me.
I have a monster pc. Visuals are great. But i keep getting disconnected every 15 min. I have a 500/500 mbit line, no issues with other games. I run my own servers on other games and people have zero issue connecting and staying connected etc.

I got the most expensive edition of the game. So far, story is OK.... visuals are great, custcenes are rly good, some animations are a little off, your shoulder gets dislocated every time you take a step. Voice acting is amazing top tier stuff huge thanks to the actors.

Gameplay tho is repetetive to death. You go to a area get and kill some mobs and u go to next area and kill some more mobs.
You run around a corner. The enemy literally stands stationary. Not even reacting to you untill you get close enough. It just feels so janky and doesnt ""flow"" at all. In those situations mobs dont feel ""alive"" at all. They are just waiting for me to kill them so i can go to the next area...

And its hella empty on content. Not enough missions for the pve. Not deep enough missions to keep the pve interesting. And to be honest customization is a little meh. How many years of dev and this is it? And then you bundle up some more customization stuff for dlcs and lock it behind some random named currency.. Come on, What do you think this is? Im gonna wait here like a little puppy for 3-4-5 months untill u give me one skin of each, one weapon, one armour skin, and some random faction that basically dont mean anything. And this is going to keep me hyped to play? gtfo i payed 99 bucks for this ♥♥♥♥ dude and i still disconnect constantly and it infuriates me because i have a hard time playing pve and pvp.

Weapons are like pee shooters. Melta guns/cannons doesnt melt ♥♥♥♥. Literally 2 meters from a bioform the heavy melta should incinerate that bio like nothing, but i put 3 shots in to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and he still running around like i tickled his chin. The bolter is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand rocket launcher and face shots do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They are getting miniature rocket powered artillery shells that are specifically design to pierce armour and blow up right in the face and they just keep walking. I understand its a game, but i dont feel ""Space Marine"" powerfull at all.,

If this is primaris space marine. It feels like a downgrade. You pop 2 shots off before the enemy is to close so you start to flail around like a spastic ape trying to put in some ""combos"". These combos are so slow that you manage to get swarmed so now you have to start rolling around like a moron and swinging randomly to get ads down before you can focus on the bigger guys that have been shooting at you from a distance.

Primaris marine? Everything hurts. One of these smallest creatures step on your toes you take damage.
These primaris marines take damage from the smallest las gun from a grunt. While on the internets you can clearly see space marines comfortably standing in front of a stationary las turret and eat that like the tank that he is. Not in Space Marine 2. I guess they made the primaris armour a little softer so it doesnt chafe as much in the crotch area....

Space marine 2 made me kinda understand why they turned to the chaos gods for more power......

Ive read alot of the lore. And the story depth that exists for 40k is almost immeasurable. Space Marine 2 story feels a little rushed. There is so much story they could have put in to this about the chaos marines for example. Where they come from. Their primarch etc or sooomething more.
When they showed up on screen it felt like. Here is your new enemy, he looks like you but he has a special hat and hes purple. And im chasing this mfker asking myselfe why the ♥♥♥♥ can he teleport?
And i cant let go of the tought if alot of it got left on the cutting floor.

My second heart hurts that i have to give this a negative review.
If the connection issues dont get solved and we dont get some amazing dlcs for rly cheap.
This season pass for 39 bucks is not ok either. 20 bucks difference from the full game? The season pass is not worth the 39 bucks. Not even close. I dont think its even worth 20 bucks.
A couple missions for pve and pvp maps and some small skins....39?

I know you are getting alot of praise right now by the normies impressed by the visuals and the ""fresh"" gameplay. And the people who are starstruck from the sheer weight of the 40k franchise. You might wiggle your finger at those people and have them easily impressed.

But im looking at you. And i see what you are doing. I take my hat off for a step at the right direction compared to some of these other devs. But i see what you are doing and i dont like being taken for a fool. These dlcs better be damn good.

Not impressed what so ever. Horrible launch for the price that I payed for at least. And i have been playing warhammer games since the 90s.",2024/9/22,en

呱！好劲口牙！

阔别13年，再次跟随 泰爷爷的脚步 体验让每个40K人下体湿湿 的 终极体验吧！！
其中包括且不限于：
成为神秘组织一员！
战斗，爽！！
获得免费升级
手撕虫虫！！
在城里溜圈，围观斗蛐蛐
狂挤番茄酱！！
各种建筑爆破
所有人都敬爱我，见了我都要下跪！！

在墓园刨人祖坟
手撕小鸡！！
看大怪兽踩小人
狂放彩色烟火！！
领导亲自带头做项目，与你互通有无
在庆功宴上走上人生巅峰！！

在新世代的画面加持下，这一份40K的战场震撼独此一家，在众多一言难尽的40K游戏里也算是拔尖的了

但是 为什么 是 不推荐咧？

因为我玩了 死亡天使 难度 以及 对于游戏一些设计的不解

单人游戏中：
臭名昭著的电梯守4链条就不说了 还能说是对于你杀敌效率有一定要求 要灵活运用场景资源过关 用榴弹爆弹枪直接榴弹轰链条还是可以马上清掉翼虫的

但是机械教资料库开发电机 我就不太能理解了场景需要你使用喷火器驱逐撕裂虫 同时开启发动机并且守护一段时间
ok 但是为什么会在需要时刻用短手远程保持环境安全的情况下 设置需要长手远程才能处理的脑虫？

手枪可以管 ok 但是 死亡天使 难度导致 脑虫肉肉 不换大枪打的话 在4，5只近远程武士虫和2，30只刀虫对你蓝圈红圈的猛攻下手枪几乎无法在不瞄准的情况下把脑虫打到红温

ok 那我能不能先高效清理地面然后再干脑虫咧？ 但是 死亡天使 难度 导致 所有虫虫肉肉 普通双刀武士虫 也需要两套连招或者两个枪决才能打出红温 同时还要时刻注意地上的小蝌蚪

喷火器能不能虫虫烧烤呢？ 可以捏 但是火太亮了， 看不清蓝圈红圈， 只能和虫虫互相欧拉了， 一不小心就被在天上狂放红圈的卑鄙虫虫给滋死了

那就换大枪吧。。。为什么捡枪要有1.5秒的确认圈圈。。。什么血包也要1.5秒？。。。手雷也要。。。明明 子弹就是瞬间拿的。。。

最后自己红温了，狂拍手雷技能打药回血发电机秦王绕柱AI引怪不停猥琐手枪射击，在人极度愤怒的情况下，过了。
感觉核心问题是 死亡天使 难度下， 似乎虫虫变肉了。老兵难度下武士虫1个枪决加2，3刀（1套半连招）便能红温 而死亡天使 则需要2个枪决加2，3刀（两套半连招）才能红温

而我们的泰爷爷从头到尾无论是老兵还是死亡天使都用着他那平平无奇的3+爆弹枪（其他武器也是都是基础值），导致低难度是爆弹枪 高难度是滋水枪。而战役过程中没有任何的升级内容，导致即使与最终boss决斗时泰爷爷用的还是白板数值的爆弹枪，不愧为传奇蓝精灵。

多人游戏PVE中：
“哎呀哎呀 这游戏单人就是走个过场撑个牌面 爽就完了 干嘛纠结这个呀” 对 你说的没有错 我认为这个游戏的情怀G点在单人而游戏性亮点就在多人！我只尝试了PVE，故PVP暂不做评论。

看得出制作组花了大精力打造了6个职业 每个职业近20种特性 近二十把武器每把武器更是有多样变种以及升级，颇有暗潮的感觉。 任务皆为剧情中给泰爷爷打下手的副队行动，和剧情一样4个难度。看了武器的升级选项，原来泰爷爷的3+爆弹枪最后可以变成9+，怪不得 死亡天使 难度这么难 原来最精锐的蓝精灵全在主战场外（红温了）

3个近战职业（狂战，刺客，坦克）3个远程职业（步枪，狙，机枪哥）每个职业换着玩也是能体验到各种乐趣 泰爷爷是啥？泰爷爷职业就是爷，爷开技能能回血！

但是游戏的一些设定始终让我有点摸不着头脑：
生命值回复：似乎游戏中并没有各类PVE游戏中存在的休息站，只有换装备的武器站，地图里也只有寥寥无几的血包需要在三个蓝精灵之间分配，导致血量在任务中会越打越少。除了少数职业有“在XX情况下回复1%血量”或者“30%血量下，只要XX就能恢复5%血量”这种回血的天赋，大多数人只能靠倒了拉起和死了重生来恢复自己的状态。特别在高难度合作下的确是个问题。

护盾值：明显制作组希望玩家多打枪决，多打处决来回盾以此减少对血条的压力，虽然处决是有无敌时间的，但是 似乎 好像 枪决 是会被红圈攻击打断的。处决动画是很帅啦但是也满长的，比如说虫虫红温了我是机枪哥我可能跟倾向于直接继续扫，继续多扫两枪出枪决标了，1枪秒了，接着扫别的虫虫。 感觉在实战中大多数人差不多也是团战快打完了才会挑红温的虫虫回状态，我觉得更好的情况是，精英虫和刀虫处决一样 1秒到2秒这样或许会对于近战职业更加友好。

捡东西：1.5秒，为什么？补弹药？Ok的，回满状态，有点小惩罚，理解。枪？怕拿错枪，好吧。手雷？是怕我换错手雷嘛。血包？怕我多拿血包？一般性设计等待圈是因为物品有多种用途或者和别的行为按键冲突，或者是物品重叠，又或者是重要抉择关键物品。残血一路刺激溜虫好不容易看见了个血包&手雷结果不能路过捡起（红温了）

敌人提示：背后出现红圈提示，你猜是啥。是武士虫十字斩我，还是脑虫朝我丢粑粑，还是蛇虫刺我屁屁还是刀斧虫要来扑倒我了。 脑虫粑粑丢两下，可能还是射线要延迟躲。唯一能被认出来的只有狙击虫的射线。这还未涉及到混沌部分。辨别场上有哪些精英全靠好人队友标点，特别是泰伦一家子在一团一起冲过来，光武士虫就4个变体，真的没法立马认出来，更不用说背后偷袭的卑鄙小人了。暗潮好歹还给精英上个大绿夜视仪头上插点图腾，说点骚话让你有逼数。这一团白白紫紫张牙舞爪的也没啥特殊音效，3，4个武士虫混个蛇虫被插才知道。

人群控制：清群溜怪，PVE经典桥段。有没有懂哥说一下？ 我感觉似乎就是靠近战哥吸怪，两人狂射，近战哥处决回盾这么个循环。 一旦近战哥拖不住了，而似乎也没有职业拥有嘲讽，推击，阻拦类似的技能，远程哥压力大增。清群武器就大锤和充能动力剑，接着就是机枪，热熔。地图大多开阔地少有走廊房间隘口等能集力绞杀的地点。

然后 6张图，这么多职业，这么多武器，就一个字，肝。暗潮肝4个探员，这里有六个蓝精灵！！但是没有武器词条，天赋也较多为角色被动而不与武器相连，很难想象满级后能有什么动力继续刷。

说了这么多给了个不推荐，因为感觉就现在内容似乎一眼望到头，但是心里也是希望这个游戏能做好的。40K著以出粪游闻名，这几年风向转好但出的游戏也是史味巧克力或者巧克力味史。但是随着行商浪人的出版和9月9忆战斗兄弟的好评反响，马上暗潮月底也要更新武器系统，难道40K人的好日子要来力嘛？
最后希望saber组好好开发，多出图，多出有特色有识别度的敌人，能使玩家开发有趣玩法的天赋，以及我上面所述的一些问题。。求求你改了吧。。。或者有无懂哥让我明白一下到底为啥这么设计。

谢谢大家

Danie,0,27.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/daniele20/,"The game started light on content with puzzling design choices, but I was willing to give it a chance as the premise seemed good.

After this first update where the developers doubled down on nerfing stuff and buffing absolutely nothing, introducing a new difficulty where everything is tankier, in a game where the enemies already felt like bullet sponges... I really cannot reccomend it for the amount of content it offers at the moment.

The combat when you look at it is pretty shallow and at high level of play there's three usable classes in PVE with one good weapon, the rest are literally unusable as they deal too little damage. The entire melee weapon roster is underpowered, in a game where melee is supposed to be the focus of the combat system.
(You can literally look up the datamined DPS values of weapons and compare them yourself.)

Half the class roster feels like it's filled with useless perks that activate on very conditional triggers and the PVP is an unbalanced mess that is already getting swarmed by cheaters.

If you really love warhammer then it might still be a worthy purchase, but honestly I regret spending money for a 12 hours long campaign that has no replayability whatsoever, coupled with multiplayer modes that also offer no replayability or reward. (other than unlocking new colours for your space marines, wohoo!)

At this point it feels like no matter how shallow a game is, as long as you have pretty graphics and speak against the ""DEI Agenda"" then you'll have a ton of gamers supporting your game and saying it's amazing.",2024/10/18,en

Pilps,1,49.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pilps/,"Space Marine 2 is fun.

CAMPAIGN

Great, better than the first games in every way, but. A a few gripes of mine, for starters. If you've progressed through the campaign & you weren't the party leader with friends, none of your progress is saved. Your campaign progress is tied to whoever was the party leaders.

So if you want to replay specific missions you would of had to of been the party leader yourself, otherwise you can't play them.

So if you want to continue where you left off, you have to plan it accordingly with your friends and have the same party leader, (harder if you're all in your 30's with jobs and families) or play it all over again solo or as the party leader with a new batch of friends.

Vehicles? Turrets? Anything? Nope. All infantry combat, which is fine, but it felt like a cop out. You're even teased with a tank in one mission, and all it is, is a in game cutscene from A to B, nothing more.

Speaking of cutscenes, although beautifully made, a good chunk of the gameplay is just that.... pre-rendered or in game cutscenes.

Lack of the variety of enemies. There should of been more variants. Once you start going through missions combat sadly starts feeling the same unless a certain point in the game a new enemy is added into the mix for plot/campaign status. But then it quickly looses it's excitement when it just falls in line with everything else and just becomes the norm again.

However despite those gripes, i thoroughly enjoyed it. There is also replay-ability value there if you fancy a go at all three of the main characters of your squad with their different unique abilities. 8/10


CO-OP Missions

I like how they have been designed. They are aligned with the main campaign. They focus on a different squad of AI/characters related to the story that do their plot/story progression on the side unseen from the main campaign. But this time you get to play them. And knowing how certain events happened and why from the eyes of this new squad is a nice touch of story telling.

The added bonus to it is you have a lot more freedom of choice, you have all 6 classes to choose from, play around with, customise and level up. Everything weapons wise is unlocked from the get go so freedom of choice / chance to experiment isn't locked behind a levelling tree.

What you do unlock however is customisation and upgrades for your weapons/gear.

Is the co-op fun? Yes. Is it a bit of a slug fest after you complete the full set of missions based/linked to the campaign? That totally depends on what you personally like. I enjoyed myself, but I don't see myself really ever replaying them again other than to play with friends for a nice chill sesh.

If grinding away against endless hordes of AI is your thing. With games such as Darktide, then this is right up your ally. I've already sunk enough hours into Darktide however to do it all over again. 7/10

Eternal War (PVP)

This is personally my favourite aspect of the game, despite it's current bare bones structure. Levelling and unlocking is accustomed to the usual stuff you see in games such as Call of Duty, level up, unlock new gun, new item, new gear, play away.

It is however a lot more grindier to gain XP and points for skins/customisation items then it's CO-OP counterpart. Which can be challenging for some but rewarding for others.

There are already some very overly powered meta's in game, if you're going against high levels and a majority of your team is low levels, you're going to 9/10 have a very bad time.

Only 3 maps, all that a custom to the three game modes.

Annihilation (Team Deathmatch)
Seize Ground (Domination)
Capture & Control (King of the Hill)

With the three maps, map knowledge is essentially an advantage at this point if you've played longer than others. Their design, look and feel is very symmetrical, it extremely reminds me of Gears of War 1, 2 & 3's Multiplayer Map Design. There are no advantages to which team/spawn you're on, everything spawn and level design wise is balanced.


All in all very fun, challenging but rewarding. 9/10

The campaign is an epic of rare intensity, where neophytes and veterans alike unite in a brutal, merciless spectacle. It is a blood-soaked work, where steel and determination clash, a perfect outlet for those seeking to escape the monotony of their banal lives. Under the command of the iconic Sergeant Demetrian Titus, you embark on an unrelenting crusade against countless enemies, some of whom appear for the first time in a video game to face the wrath of the Imperium, all modeled with a meticulousness worthy of the Omnissiah.

The game’s PvE is praised for its demand, rewarding those who master the art of combat and forge their Space Marine with care, without ever drowning in sterile complexity. The gameplay, as fluid as a bolter spewing death, transcends the heaviness of the armored hero. Every step of this warrior, weighing like a Rhino, is felt in the heat of battle. As for PvP, while it offers epic clashes, it still lacks that brutal essence that permeates the universe of the 41st millennium.

In conclusion, this opus is a divine offering to those who seek an intense escape into fury and glory. But be warned, the path is fraught with challenges, the difficulty is high, and learning the patterns is essential if you do not wish to be torn apart by a Tyranid. Find yourself battle-brothers, for only heroes united under the Emperor's banner survive the storms of fate. It is a masterpiece for the initiated, a final war cry that will pin you to your throne.

The blessings of the Omnissiah:
• Imperial visuals: The graphics, in 4K Ultra, are grand frescoes capturing the majesty of the Imperium’s cruisers in the cold void of space.
• Heroic crusade: Every mission is an epic battle where heroes are covered in glory and receive the highest honors.
• Tactical maneuvers: The gameplay, as sharp as the skirmishes of the Space Marines, challenges Xenos and heretics with a consuming rage.
• Homage to the ancestors: A saturated ode of references, as faithful as the archives of the Mechanicum, preserving the very essence of the original game.

But the work is not finished:
• PvP too limited: Clashes between Space Marines must capture more of the brutality of the 41st millennium.
• Endgame content: The Mechanicum must forge more missions and quests to extend the heroes’ epic journey.
• Bestiary too limited: The battlefields thirst for new enemies, whether it be rampaging Orks, Necrons, or the cunning T’au.
• Warp instabilities: The Tech-priests must resolve the server disruptions to ensure a stable experience.
• Uneven difficulty: Some enemies, like the Neurothrope, seem beyond the reach of mere mortals.
• Capricious parries: Squads must perfect their mastery of close combat to ensure effective responses to enemies.
• Resilience of the Primaris: The Apothecarion must enhance protocols to ensure the Primaris reflect their legendary invincibility against the hordes.

The Forges of Mars are already active, preparing future improvements. For the path to glory never ends in the unforgiving universe of the 41st millennium. For the Emperor and for humanity, this game aspires to ascend among legends.

PS: As a devoted servant of the Imperium, I can attest that my war machine, forged in the most powerful industrial worlds, knows no failure or weakness. No crashes, no framerate drops trouble the blessed functioning of this technological relic. My cogitator runs with immeasurable power, so much so that even in 4K Ultra, it barely awakens, effortlessly maintaining 60 FPS (capped), like an Astartes meditating before battle. However, I understand that some may face the dark forces of optimization with configurations less blessed by the Omnissiah. May the Machine Spirit aid them!",2024/9/21,en

[4.1 Review] Glad to see a responsive set of devs this time around who seriously considered whether they were correct in their decisions or not. Removing the Armor Tether is a great change since the initial system was poorly thought out to begin with. Hopefully they add a different modifier down the line that creates meaning without hamstringing your own gameplay. Also glad to see the Bolt weapons finally getting the love they deserve. Honestly, it was criminal how lousy they were at the start since Saber have managed incredible Bolt weapon sound design and feel that just made them feel good to shoot despite being impractical due to low damage. I'm generally ambivalent toward the armor changes but hopefully it gives more people more margin for error due to not everyone being parry gods or being so overwhelmingly good that they can carry a whole team out of a completely FUBAR scenario single-handedly.

Stay Frosty,0,12.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NinthGrove/,"In all honesty, i was very hyped for this game and avoided any game play footage or deep dives into the game. pre-purchased as i played the first one and can confidently say, Space Marine was an absolutely great game for its time (Emphasis on for its time. Key factor for this review) So the date of release comes around and i boot up and dive in. I'm going to keep this short and to the point. The Campaign was absolutely amazing, the scenes of battle and fighting through battlefields was amazing and immensely fun. They really captured the feel of 40k with every mission. Superb.... Roughly 8-9 hours later.... Story finished.... And honestly i cant give any reason to come back to this game after finishing the campaign. I had built up in my head that they were going to go down the Hell Divers route with this game and open it up a bit, really expand on the online social aspect of it. But they never. Its a very linear short story which is great mind you. Cant fault the gameplay and story at all. its Space Marine 1 improved, not expanded and that's my problem with it. There are like... 6-8 online operations that you can play as a team online with 2 other players and you can play those over and over again i suppose if you want to unlock different armors etc.... but to what end? To play through the same 6 missions with new armor? There is the online but like Space Marine 1, i just cant recommend it at all. Played one match and noped out of there. Does a linear story at 8 hours long survive in today's climate? I'm not sure. But i would be lying if i said i wasn't disappointed that i'm essentially just uninstalling this game after playing it for 8 hours. Though those 8 hours were fun and very well put together story wise. If you're fine with a linear 8 hour story with some side content sprinkled in to top it off then i would say go for it. If you were hoping for more to get engaged with and dive in deeper, i just cant justify getting it for the price. Its Space Marine improved.... Not expanded.",2024/9/7,en

Queen Frau the Round,1,69,https://steamcommunity.com/id/queenfrau/,"A slight departure from the first game, but a good one!

Originally I left a negative review on this game after I started a new campaign on Veteran. ""I just did my fourth play-through of Space Marine 1!,"" I thought, ""I'm basically a Veteran already!"" Oh how wrong I was. I got frustrated that I kept dying, and blamed the game for it. It wasn't until I put more hours in that I finally caught my stride, and I can play Veteran comfortably. For your first campaign run, I suggest playing on Normal.

Space Marine 2 continues the tale of badassness of Demetrian Titus, and I feel it definitely does him justice. The campaign is short, sweet, and bombastic as all Hell and jumps the shark (positive) in the final two missions. The writing is solid, the gameplay loop hard but fun.

The biggest change from SM1 to SM2 is the melee combat. The chainsword retains the exact same combo from the first game, which is a welcome change, but the combat system surrounding it is different. Executions no longer directly repair Health, but instead give you one pip of armor, and contested Health.

So your total health pool has non-regenerating Health and regenerating Armor. In SM1 it worked much like Halo, where the armor was a separate bar that regens after a small amount of time. In SM2, the armor is divided into 'pips', each one a set amount of HP. Before the Sept. 29, 2024 patch, each chaff enemy would hit you for one pip of armor. So if you are hit twice, you are now bleeding non-recoverable health damage. Now, they just do damage as if you are hit by anything else.

Executions now regenerate armor, usually 1-2 pips depending on difficulty. You can also regenerate armor via parrying. Yes, there's now parrying and parry windows in this game, marked by a big blue indicator. Red indicators, you must dodge, with an i-frame dodge. And one top of that, if you recently took Health damage, you can deal damage back to regen contested health. Oh, and if you stun enemies, you can also do a gunstrike that deletes chaff and staggers bigger targets with a 1-pip armor regen and no i-frames.

This is like a weird mix of Bloodborne and SM1, and requires a bit of practice and old-habit deletion to get down, but once you're in the flow, it's a wonderful time. The power fantasy has shifted from 'I can just walk all over Orkz with ease' to 'I can dodge, shoot, duck, weave, and destroy 'nids with skill.' It's fun!

Oh, and like the first game, the Meltagun / Melta Rifle is goated.",2024/9/14,en

Ok so, after 40 hours playing mostly operations I still recomend the game with some caveats.

The campaign is amazing.

The difficulty pushing in OPS tho is retarded.
There are so many problems with difficulty that has been written by me and DodoSwarm on the offical forums I will just link the thread.



Bottom line is difficulty needs heavy tweaking or there has to be an economy added for armory data/requisition.

If you are not into ball busting difficulty (like inferno on diablo 3 release), but want to progress and not satisfied with PVP and Campaign offerings don't buy it.
Operations higher difficulty is a mess.

Для фана вахи это абсолютный мастхэв, это тот самый ААА проект который мы столько лет ждали, постановка, сюжет, знаковые персонажи - просто сидишь и визжишь как ребенок. Эпик только увеличивается с каждой миссией и в целом компания идет столько сколько нужно. Куча крутых постановочных сцен, невероятно красивые и детализированные локации - это просто какой-то праздник пафоса и восхищения.

Обычно после прохождения на свежую голову начинаешь выискивать минусы, но тут я просто объективно их почти не вижу, кроме не слишком сбалансированной боевки, где ты в секунду теряешь все хп и без кооператива тащить ласт сложности просто анрил. Но в целом боевка классная, ей буквально не хватает 10-20% шлифовки чтобы можно было всегда тащить на скиле, ибо порой врагов столько, что не успеваешь уклониться, спарировать и плюс нельзя отменять анимации, что тоже порой заставляет получить оплеуху. Но в целом за всю компанию я ни разу не почувствовал чувство духоты и того что я хочу все дропнуть.

Единственное возвращаясь к сложности, я задушился играть на 3 и стал на 2 и даже там видны проблемы баланса, оно не сильно портит впечатления игры именно на 2 сложности, все что выше это не сбалансированный ад, который надо будет исправлять, если бы я пытался пройти все на них, то скорее всего небезосновательно крыл бы матом разрабов как большая часть отрицательных обзоров, так что надеюсь что после полного релиза разработчики как-то это подправят патчами, иначе это неиграбельно.

А сцена с флагом..... я буквально прослезился, как это было круто.
Операции в игре тоже прекрасны, особенно если проходить их параллельно сюжету, ибо всё это переплетается. Боевые братья перекидывается интересными репликами, которые дают плюс вайб для тех кто прям шарит в теме, и конечно этим разрабы раскрывают характер космодесов и чутка их быт.
Разработчики тоже красавцы, в теме явно разбираются в мельчайших подробностях, и явно следят, что пишут об игре игроки.

НО, всегда есть ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ НО. Это минусы.
Так вот, начнём как раз с того, что в игре очень, ОЧЕНЬ много нытиков, ибо, если их было бы мало, то вряд ли разрабы занерфили недавно вышедшую сложность буквально за пару дней.
Это было прям реально обидно, так как в игре появился хоть какой-то челендж ибо игра реально испытывала тебя и твоих братьев на прочность ибо до этого игра стала изи даже на существующей макс сложности, мы буквально в 3, а то и в 2 рыла пробегали миссии с некаченными классами и пушками, и когда мы увидели новую сложность... Это было круто, а награда... Это того стоили братья мои. И вот мы прошли всё на новой сложности изрядно попотев, особенно СПАСИБО хаоситам (НЕНАВИЖУ ЭТИХ ТВАРЕЙ (Но любя)), сидим смеёмся, как добрая часть игроков плачут и ноют, что слишком СЛОЖНА и пройти НЕРЕАЛЬНО и они пришли в игру за FUN, а это совсем не FUN, можно конечно сказать -""поставь дебил сложность пониже раз не можешь."", так они хотят всё в игре разблокировать, вот только УЧИТЬСЯ играть они не хотят, им главное, чтоб им в тупую давали FUN, только вот эти нытики не смогут познать той радости, когда ты проходишь эту самую ступень сложности и понимаешь, что теперь ты сам в действительности стал АНГЕЛОМ СМЕРТИ.
Разрабы тоже молодцы, в тупую послушали этих чепухов и занерфили сложность в хлам, очень грустно конечно, но мы теперь с братьями прошедшие первые дни 5 сложности будем помнить это и каждый раз говорить как старые деды, раньше было лучше.

Ну ещё можно сказать про ПВП в это игре, но я не хочу, так как оно рудиментарное говнище, загибаем пальцы:
Баланс вышел и курит в сторонке (Спасибо, что хоть авангарда поднерфили)
Гранаты представлены в 4 видах открывающиеся по ходу прокачки, но самая юзабельная это шоковая так как: 1) контроль огромной зоны в виде урона, который ещё не дамажет владельца, тем временем операции передают привет за такие приколы 2)слепит буквально до конца твоей жизни 3) Лютое замедло. В одной этой гранате смысла больше чем в других
Матчмейкинг которого нет, тут ещё баланс вспомнить можно ибо оружие которое открывается с рангом унижает в хлам, да-да мельта и плазма, я про вас
Карты, а что карты ? Они красивые до ужаса, ровно как и маленькие и благодаря респауну в секунду, я когда стоял на вражеской домашке, то думал, что сражаюсь с кучей тиранидов, а не космодесов. А ещё карт мало
Ближний бой в пвп говно ибо побеждает тот, кто первый ударил, а так называемое парирование не работает, а даже если работал, то привет рандомный пинг в команде а и б.
Кстати о классах, небольшое отступление от унижения пвп в игре, вот есть ощущение, что в игре есть нормальные классы, крутые классы и штурмовик, вот ШТУРМОВИК - это самое ненавистное создание разработчиков, его так в этой части унизили, мой друг чуть не плакал.
Много аспектов за которые ещё можно ругать игру, но я не буду, ибо играть в этот режим на серьёзных щах, а тем более соло вряд ли кто-то будет.

Кастомайз прям крут, если не учитывать, что в игре есть цвета, которые тупо не отображаются как надо, как пример, в игре в текущий момент нет НОРМАЛЬНОГО чёрного, то полу-чёрное унылое говнище я отказываюсь принимать за полноценный чёрный, золото нормального человека недавно только добавили, ну и символике чудовищно мало, но это поправят со временем, а так в общем - Бомба.

Итог сея высера
В душе не чаю, для кого я это пишу и зачем, да и кто это вообще читать будет.
В общем и целом игра прям зашла, разработчики развеяли миф о том, что по Вахе 40к и в принципе наверное по Вахе, делают говнище, а не игры. Я больше чем уверен, что спустя даже несколько сотен часов проведенных в этой игре мне будет приятно вернуться и порезать на фарш местных тараканов ибо то, как это всё сделано и анимировано прям приводит меня в детскую радость, ну и конечно есть мододелы.

Hamburger,0,7.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dougchub/,"People gave this game a ton of credit for being well optimized and looking good, but there is a lot missing here.

weapon variety, enemy variety, ramping up difficulty in combat, powering up/adding skills all REALLY lacking.

Combat is OK, melee is ONE (1) button, and feels a little float-y and doesn't have much ""punch"" you kind of just glide through enemies without resistance (outside of executions). parry/dodge/counter works sometimes, doesn't feel consistent. You end up getting staggered, stun locked, or stuck in a reload way to often. It's often not clear why you've taken damage or from where. The input/output in combat just feels kinda weird.

You have to push the SAME button 5000 times, whether an elevator or some other interaction with the environment, it's the same asset. Never a puzzle, or a different way to ""activate"" whatever needs to be activate. Clearly cut corners here.

Cut scenes, pretty good. Some odd points where it feels like a set piece should go fade to black and back in instead. Seems they rushed in several spots.

Story, bare bones but fine. Didn't utilize one of the best-developed fantasy worlds in all of fiction. Voice acting is excellent, and so is the writing though.

.

Other games do what this game should, but better. Helldivers II has better combat. This game takes a lot influence from DOOM, but doesn't execute as well: guns lack punch, glory kills are less rewarding, you have to pause to pick up ammo, mis-calibrated resource scarcity, too many 1 shot horde enemies, too little variety besides ""more"" enemies and no coordination among them.

Overall, it's ok. Not mad I bought it. But could have just watched the cut scenes on youtube and skipped the gameplay.",2024/10/1,en

Kahran Ramsus,0,28.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KahranRamsus/,"So far I've finished the campaign and I'm playing through the Operations (Multiplayer Coop) with some friends. There are good aspects to this game. The campaign was overall not too bad, there was some good spectacle, and as someone who isn't super involved with Warhammer 40K, I thought that it felt like a good dip into the universe. Voice acting and presentation is good.

The downside is that there is a lot of really bizarre design choices. For a game based around Ultramarines and Space Marines that are genetically engineered soldiers that live for centuries fighting endless wars, it generally seems like you're wearing armour weaker than paper mache. The design goal was that your armour (Contempt) regenerates through executions of enemies, and once you're out of armour, you lose health, and it does not regenerate. The goal isn't bad, but the execution (pun intended) is. You're supposed to prevent constant damage intake and prolonging your survival by doing consistent perfect parries to trigger Gun shot finishers on minor enemies or do enough damage to major enemies to trigger an execution. The problem is that the Perfect parry seems to get easily confused if two enemies attack you at once, and even if you were to parry one, it might react to another one and you end up doing nothing instead. You can also, easily, get staggered repeated by enemy melee hits, even from minor enemies, that means if you do a properly timed parry but the game gets confused on which enemy you're parrying, you can get staggered and lose all your armour, and on higher difficulties all of your HP too, in mere seconds. The Gun shot executions that restore a full armour chunk also don't make you invincible like standard executions do, so doing one is actually going to kill you if you have literally anything near you.

That's a lot for just one mechanic, so let's rally off some other quick things. When parrying you can animation lock yourself if it's timed poorly, the red counter mechanic can often leave very little opportunity to evade, the Heavy class cannot easily evade while aiming down sights despite NEEDING to aim down sight to effectively fire, the Heavy has basically no melee weapon in a game designed around melee'ing for survival, If you have a weapon that is ""block"" based and removes Perfect Parry it still tries to Perfect Parry anyway so if you try to Blue Counter an enemy and it dies (from team mates) you end up doing the attempted perfect parry animation and locking yourself into getting hit for no reason.

Let's talk about some of the perks for weapons and characters in the game next. While I had insane respect that the devs have most of the game based around small damage numbers since most games get severely imbalanced very quickly because everything does 42 billion damage and becomes incomprehensible.

However, they designed perks with huge numbers in mind, rather than small. The Bolt Pistol does 2 damage per shot at the beginning and does 9 damage with it's highest damage Artifact variant. The mods on the weapon that increase the damage are things like ""10% more damage to Tyrmanids."" So, less than 1 extra damage at Max upgrades and 0.2 damage at lowest upgrade (when you get this perk.) Most perks have bizarre, low percentage figures like this. Or have timed bonuses that make no sense. Again, Bolt Pistol has a perk where when you Perfect Parry an enemy, you get 25% damage for 5 seconds. So 0.5 (2 at max rank) damage for 5 seconds. This seems really underwhelming considering you'd have to play for quite awhile to unlock some of this stuff. If you want to have a risk/reward system why not make it 100% damage for 10 seconds? Or if you want to encourage a specific playstyle, after a gun shot execution you gain double damage for 10 seconds. Something to encourage the player to be in that situation.

Class perks are all over the place. Some perks are completely worthless, while others are actually pretty decent. Like Bulwark's level 9 Signature ability. When you lose all your armour you drop a shock grenade. Cooldown is 120 seconds. 2 full minutes for something that can happen a half dozen times, and the shock grenades don't even do that much for you considering their small zone.

Do I think this game is good? Yes, the campaign was very cool.

Do I think that some of the weapons are awesome to use and help you fill specific roles well? Absolutely. Between weapons like the Power Sword, the Las Rifle, the Warhammer, the Heavy Bolter, and so on, you can bring swift glory to the emperium.

But do I think you should play anything past the story campaign right now? No, not a chance. The main campaign is a brief 10 hours and none of your weapons or unlocks affect your campaign so I can't think of any reason why you'd want to waste the time.

Wait for patches to fix the weapon upgrade system and all of the severely underwhelming classes and perks, as well as balance the enemies properly, and the difficulties for the campaign.

It's not that it's unplayable, but it's not very fun once you do the higher difficulties. Or at least it's not fun for very long if you aren't a hardcore Warhammer person, and even my friends I'm playing with are big fans and are struggling to enjoy the game. I think Fat Shark could really lend a hand here for Saber Interactive on the multiplayer aspect.",2024/9/15,en

I really like this game it feels great to play and am happy a road map was already shown to address many issues. Though I have a few things I wish they would add and change.

Changes:
- It does not make sense to have operations and pvp not transfer your level in between each other. If I grind my level in operations my level should be the same for pvp so that I can access all the weapons I grinded for.
- make it easier to level up
- Add another class like tech marine, apothecary, chaplain
- Make it so that heretic astartes are not locked in to only 1 class

Additions:
- For pvp they should add execution kills to make the game cooler
- Add a parry mechanic because melee against character feels just like who hits first gurantees a win.
- Buff the assault class it is definitely the weakest class overall. Make the animations fast , maybe give it a stun when it slams in the air and more armor so it does not instantly die and add lightning claws.
- Add more voice lines for the narration and the characters its annoying only hearing the same phrases over and over
- Give the heretic astartes more customization options as it is a bit disappointing that you can only change their color
- add more traitor legions like emperors children, wordbearers, sons of horus, and Thousand sons
- give loyalist unique voicelines for loyalist legions as it was done for heretics
- Add more enemies from different chaos factions other than Tzeetch.

Judge Cudge,0,6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012825255/,"You do not feel like a Space Marine in this game.

In singleplayer PVE on just veteran difficulty, which is supposedly the intended experience, even (close to) perfect play rewards you with gameplay of being constantly whittled down by weenies into flickeringly low hp when reacting to all commands perfectly and swiftly headshotting and executing every enemy whilst never being hit by even a single clean attack from anything other than explicitly and only small enemies hitting you during your own melee attack combos on larger ones.

Why is the game this way?
Even supposing this is somehow balanced around multiplayer, the mindset that somehow your hypervulnerability is the right way to accomplish this is just incorrect.

This isn't left for darktide (tm) where teamwork needs to be clumsily reinforced by having insta downs/squishiness that let people pretend they are helping eachother in the most hamfisted design decision of all time.

We are walking super human tankmen fighting bugs, and the intended gameplay experience leaves you scrambling for medicae at all times.

I win every time, but I never once feel cool or strong, and further because I am so limited on HP and ammo my reactions are all on rails.
I ALWAYS have to go for the gun reaction post parry.
I ALWAYS have to go for a cutscene execute to gain armor.
I ALWAYS have burn grenades at swarm pillars cascading up walls.
I ALWAYS pick up and use the 'use here' guns like the flamethrower.
I ALWAYS use my super mode on cooldown to scrounge HP.

I feel like a pathetically weak and clunky man walking through a giant quick time event.

Why did they do this? How is being a paper mache weakling who is forbidden from making gameplay decisions the 'intended experience'?

I want to feel like a space marine.

Рекомендую с большой натяжкой для прохождения с друзьями.

У игры есть один большой плюс - половину времени ощущаешь себя в эпицентре блокбастера. Много жирного густого экшена с полчищами врагов. Вау-эффект гарантирован.

А минусов много:

1. Игра раздражает. Одновременно тебе нужно защищать несколько объектов в разных концах базы. Датчики тебе подают сигнал, что нужно прямо сейчас парировать атаки. А тебе не до этого. В эту же секунду оператор нервно орет на тебя, что горгульи повредили антенну. А тебе еще сию секунду нужно очень медленно перезаряжаться, пока тебя жрут жуки. И делать это надо где-то каждые пять секунд.

2. Сразу не понравилась стрельба. Она тут ощущается не так прикольно, как, например, в Destiny, или Hell divers 2. Как-то ничего особенного.

3. Вместо боевого танца - неуклюжая неразбериха. Это если вы, как я, с трудом совмещаете 3d экшен c Dark souls - да, тут регулярно надо кувыркаться и парировать атаки. Как же это надоело...

4. Мультяшность качков-героев можно простить. Но всерьез игру воспринимать сложней.

5. Много невидимых стен.

А еще игра зависает при выходе.

Совершенно проходной сюжет к минусам даже не отношу, он тут для галочки. И уравновешивается в целом качественной графикой.",2024/9/11,ru
Кайса Клауд,1,88.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199062289290/,"НИ КОПЕЙКИ НЕ ЖАЛКО!

Основываясь на личных субъективных впечатлений от первых трёх часов игры - АХ*ЕННО! Когда только увидела тизер на TGA, я пищала от восторга, поскольку действительно годных игр по вахе в последнее время крайне мало, а тут нам показали прямо-таки концентрат брутализма, пафоса и мрачности. Всё по заветам Императора. Так вот, решила впервые в жизни раскошелиться на предзаказ самого полного ультра издания. Это влетело мне в копеечку, но какого хрена, один раз живём. И в предвкушении поставила на скачку. А затем поняла, что я наивная дурочка, которая на радостях забыла сравнить системные требования со своим ведром.

- для понимания: видеокарта Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, процессор Intel Core i5-9400F, RAM - 16 ГБ.

Если видюха ещё вполне справится с минималками, то вот процессор не дотягивает даже до этого. Я уже готова была молиться всем богам, чтобы игра хоть как-то пошла, хоть на каких настройках. С появлением первых отзывов надежд, что она у меня вообще запустится было всё меньше, а когда люди с куда более производительным железом писали, что даже у них игра лагает, тормозит и вылетает - мои шансы и вовсе стремились к нулю. ОДНАКО, я всё же рискнула и запустила. Первый запуск был довольно долгим, и начальный ролик по какой-то причине заглючил и пропустил половину катсцены. Но как только начался геймплей всё нормализовалось. Настройки я выставила средне-низкие и внимательно следила за температурой процессора. К моему удивлению, старичок прекрасно справлялся даже в самых масштабных баталиях, не греясь выше 65-70 градусов и выдавая стабильные 30 FPS. Картинка была достаточно плавная, без фризов и пролагиваний, графика более чем приятная даже на таких настройках. Все последующие кат-сцены шли без огрехов (единственное что в паре мест звук немного отставал от картинки).
Что касается самого геймплея - чистый восторг (ну, лично для меня)! Выбрала сложность Ветеран, чтобы превозмогать, как и положено. И, ожидаемо, мне напихали ещё в прологе по самое небалуйся)) Но стоило привыкнуть ко всем возможным действиям и уже прожимаешь нужные кнопки не задумываясь. Динамика боя просто бомбическая! Сколько раз я выходила из боя победителем с каким-то миллиметров хр, столько же раз я и отхватывала смертельных люлей. Оружие стреляет мощно и сочно, вариантов разных пушек хватает и каждая ощущается вроде похоже, но всё же по-разному. Космодесантник действительно чувствуется тяжеленной машиной смерти даже при простом передвижении, но он всё же не бессмертен и если бездумно кинуться в толпу в надежде затыкать мелкую шушеру цепным мечом - его разорвут за полминуты.
В игре отличное звуковое оформление. Окружение шумит и бахает так, что от звуков выстрела того же тяжёлого болтера (особенно в наушниках) пробегают табуны мурашек по спине. Также удобно ориентироваться на звук готовящейся парируемой и непарируемой атаки, так что даже если в гуще боя ты не видишь противника, то звук даст знать, когда прожать блок/уклонение.
Про визуал даже говорить нечего - полный восторг!
Я слышала про проблемы с сетевой игрой, но уверена, разработчики оперативно всё пофиксят. Игра сделана с огромной любовью ко вселенной и я уверена, что людям, создавшим её далеко не наплевать на свой проект. Поэтому нужно лишь немного подождать и всё разрешится.
Ни разу не жалею за покупку полного предзаказа, ибо занести денюшку на такую шикарнорсть благое дело)
Буду играть дальше, возможно потом дополню отзыв, если вылезут какие-то проблемы или наоборот, поделюсь уже полными впечатлениями. А теперь пойду возносить молитвы Духу Машины моего ПК за то, что он такой молодец))

Апдейт: Окей, есть ложка дёгтя в кастрюле супа. ИИ напарников мог бы быть чуть получше. Приказы им отдавать не получается, как в том же Mass Effect например, врагов не добивают (разве что очень редко), гранаты не кидают (ну или я этого не замечала) и, по факту, они представляют из себя такие передвижные турельки, которые могут слегка отвлечь на себя врага и поднять тебя, если xp обнулится. В целом, на Ветеране даже так проходить норм, челендж есть, но не душный (кроме чёртовых уровней с обороной антенн и цепей), и соответственно эмоциональная отдача от победы в тяжкой битве. Но всё время такое чувство, что ты тупо один всё вывозишь, напарники не ощущаются напарниками. Не сказать, чтоб это как-то сильно портило веселье, но будь они чуть поактивнее, было бы куда бодрее)

Снова апдейт: Хмм, удивительное дело, но как будто с напарниками стало получше, ульты пользуют почаще и даже вроде ставят приоритетом основную цель задания, а не беспорядочное крошево врагов. Видимо, пофиксили.

Ещё один апдейт: Прошла сюжет, градус эпика и пафоса ближе к концу повышался до почти неприличных значений) Да, сюжет прост как две копейки с парочкой небольших вотэтоповоротов, которые знакомым с вахой людьми угадывается на раз. Но в этом есть какое-то своё очарование. Сейчас многие игры и фильмы всё время пытаются завернуть сюжетные тропы в какой-то гибрид морского узла и прошлогодней ёлочной гирлянды, распутывать которые уже просто устаёшь. И вот как же порой не хватает простого и прямолинейного злого зла и доброго добра (не кидайтесь тапками, я в курсе, что в вахе каждая из фракций те ещё ублюдки :). В данном случае тех же тиранидов и бравых космодесантников. Когда ты не терзаешься в сложных душевных метаниях и не плутаешь в серых зонах морали, а просто прёшь напролом с чёткой целью без колебаний стереть с лица галактики всё, что подпадает под определение ""зла"". Мне очень понравилось и я испытала подлинное удовольствие от игры. Теперь осталось подождать патча на починку сетевого кода и с двух ног врываться в кооператив)

Что хотелось бы ещё от разработчиков, чтобы они где-нибудь в меню добавили кнопку, позволяющую сразу переключиться в оффлайн режим. Поскольку у меня при прохождении сюжета при переходе в новый сегмент главы порой терялась связь с сервером и даже когда я нажимала продолжить оффлайн, меня отбрасывало на приличный кусок главы назад и приходилось перепроходить (так было примерно 2 раза за игру, в остальных случаях потери соединения игра спокойно шла дальше, только в оффлайн режиме).",2024/9/8,ru
Shinigami-Sama,1,40.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130967517/,"Having just finished the game i am of two minds about it:

The Good: It builds on the first game and does a great job of making you feel like a space marine. Your powerful and hit like a truck, it is friendly to the lore and brings the world of 40k to life. I have seen some reviews talking about the first half of the game being the worst part and i have to disagree. The first half of the game defending worlds from tyranids is amazing and exciting. Watching a whole swarm descend on a guarded position as you, your brothers and the scared guardsmen hold the line is great.

And now here is where the bad comes in:

The second half of the game feels like a rehash of the first game. It feels like they just wanted to have you fight chaos for pretty much no reason other than you did it in the first game. This is a issue as it left me wanting more, you just seemingly wipe the nids and chase chaos and to me this was boring. When they showed there would be three worlds to fight on i was expecting a long story where i am jumping from world to world dealing with its attackers and i feel this is what saber should have done. It should have been you fighting the nids on one world whilst chaos attacks another and a 3rd faction the other and then have them merge. But instead its simply hey you seemingly dealt with the nids now go fight chaos for the last act.

Overall i recommend it if you are a fan of 40k or the first game as it does fill the need of 40k fun and that fun from the first game. Just dont expect it to fill you at the current moment roughly 2 days of playing and i have finished the story on veteran i expected more saber.

ВАСЯ,1,38.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vasilevskiy1/,"This isn’t just a game; it’s a pilgrimage into the grimdark glory of Warhammer 40K, where every bolter shot sings praises to the Emperor and every Tyranid screams in regret for ever invading the galaxy. You don’t play as a Space Marine — you ascend to one, crushing heretics and xenos alike with the elegance of a chainsword tearing through alien flesh.

The setting? A masterpiece of gothic despair, where every ruin and skull (so many skulls!) reminds you that the galaxy hates you — and you're here to hate it right back. Tyranids swarm like they own the place (spoiler: they don’t), and Chaos whispers temptations you answer with righteous ultraviolence.

Graphics? So good it’s practically a heretical experience. My PC now has a Machine Spirit that groans every time I boot it up. Gameplay? It’s like the Codex Astartes came to life and gave you a chainsword, saying, “Go forth and do the Emperor’s work.”

Flaws? Just one: I can’t shout FOR THE EMPEROR loud enough to match the carnage on-screen. But that’s not the game’s fault — that’s on me.

If you’ve ever wanted to stand against an endless swarm of Tyranids, crack their chitinous skulls, and tell Chaos where it can shove its warp nonsense, this is your moment.

Слишком короткая кампания на +8 часов, она проходится буквально за вечер,но в отличии от первой части здесь есть коопчик(из за него я эту кампанию проходил аж целых 2-3 недели ,что бы собраться и пройти вместе с друзьями,но один КИДОС,все равно прошел её один в тихаря...) со своими мини прикалдесами. По ходу игры мы встретили всего лишь один серьезный баг в одной главе на передвижном мосту, где тираниды стреляли в нас сквозь текстуры и мы не могли там ничего подобрать. В целом кампания мне понравилась, под конец стало интересно и ПАФОСНО, но не более.
есть так же ПВЕ режим с прокачкой, это побочный/параллельный сюжет основному, дополняющий историю сюжета.

ну а теперь перейдем к основному блюду ПВП...он просто ужасен и дисбалансен...
(обзор описывает игру ДО ПАТЧА)
ИМБА АВАНГАРД который своим крюком притягивается к вам, СТАНИТ вас во время ЗАЦЕПА во время ПОЛЕТА и во время СТОЛКНОВЕНИЯ и выносит вас расстрелом без шансов на отыгрыш ,потому что вы будете все это время в СТАНЕ(а это в худшем случае +2 секунды),так же не нужно забывать что пока он к вам подтягивается в вас так же будет настреливать вся остальная команда. Он так же имеет вертикальный геймплей(может притягиваться к уступам, окнам, стенам и т.д) что дает ему тактическое преимущество.
Или БАСТИОН который имеет щит с БЕСКОНЕЧНОЙ прочностью. Вы можете сколько угодно в него стрелять, из чего угодно стрелять, и все что его может вскрыть это выше описанный Авангард крюком, либо крак-граната, либо силовые удары в ближнем бою (ну и естественно либо настреливать в бок/спину, тут уж очевидно). Но так как Гении на разрабах ГЕНИИ, они не доумились сделать ""огонь по своим"" и по этому вся его команда может ПРОШИВАТЬ его ПОПАДАЯ В ВАС, но вы НЕ СМОЖЕТЕ ОТВЕТИТЬ, потому что будете стрелять в щит... и по этому самый грамотный щитовик, просто встанет в узком проходе и вы не сможете зайти на точку, пока не вскроете это недоразумение, либо же он просто встанет в углу/на краю и не даст вам получать очки с точки.
Так же в игре можно АБУЗИТЬ УГЛЫ, АБУЗИТЬ КАМЕРУ (ведь игра то у нас от 3 лица) по этому вы просто можете встать к углу и вы будете все видеть, но враг вас не будет видеть. Абуз угла заключается в том, что подойдя к краю(к правому) он сможет стрелять в вас практический через стену,частью своей модельки,поэтому в такого сверхразума будет сложно попасть. Так же положение персонажа в игре смещена в левую часть, отчего вы будете видеть ОГРОМНЫЕ просторы справа (из за чего абуз и происходит только у правого угла) и микрообзор слева, т.е если вы захотите абузить ЛЕВЫЙ УГОЛ, то вам придется выходить из за него ВСЕЙ МОДЕЛЬКОЙ, из за чего стрельба с левого угла в правый, становится дико неудобной. Гении на разрабах не смогли ДОУМИТЬСЯ сделать переключение плеча (право/лево) ведь это очень сложно и не очевидно, да и работать надо.
Так же в игре ВСРАТЫЙ ближний бой. Они происходят по 2 сценариям, либо пытаются закликать друг друга, либо блокировать. Но блокирование в этой игре бесполезный шлак(вы можете лишь надеется что бы команда помогла), потому что вы не можете прервать спам врага,т.е вы можете блокировать до посинения, но вставить свой удар после блока не можете, потому что в ПВП режиме нету ПАРРИРОВАНИЯ!! из за чего бой в ближнем бою 1х+2 это бой без шансов.
Ну и конечно же позорный запуск в игре всего 3 режима и 3 карты... сразу вспоминается реклама Эльдарадо
2 ядра 2 гига игровая видеокарта, тут же у нас 3 режима(2 из которых унылые и неинтересные) 3 карты игровая видео кампания. Постоянные зависания,постоянные бесконечные загрузки, на релизе так вообще постоянные: игра выйдет через час, игра выйдет через час, игра выйдет уже скоро, игра выйдет уже скоро, игра выйдет через час, игра выйдет через час, игра выйдет уже скоро...(теперь после пУтча еще и микрофризы сраные), говна сервера на марсе (ну серьезно, почему нельзя было сделать хотя бы всратенький сервер в РФ, а если нельзя так хотя бы в Прибалтике или Польше) из за чего вы окажется либо в священной европке с пингой 80-90,либо в еще более священной омерике с пингой 150-200 (на релизе у меня пинга вообще была за 300)
UPD: и постоянные ЗАГРУЗКИ ЗАГРУЗКИ ЗАГРУЗКИ ЗАГРУЗКИ. ЗАГРУЗКА ИГРЫ ЗАГРУЗКА МЕНЮ ЗАГРУЗКА БАРЖИ, ЗАГРУЗКА ЛОББИ, ЗАГРУЗКА МАТЧА, ЗАГРУЗКА ОКОНЧАНИЯ МАТЧА, ЗАГРУЗКА ДРУЖЕСТВЕННОЙ БАРЖИ(тут вообще не понятно почему происходит загрузка, у всех бл*ть одна и та же баржа), РАСПАД ПАЧКИ И ЗАГРУЗКА СВОЕЙ БАРЖИ, ЗАГРУЗКА ПВЕ ПАЧКИ, ЗАГРУЗКА РАСПАДА ПВЕ ПАЧКИ, ЗАГРУЗКА ШЕЙДЕРОВ, ЗАГРУЗКА ПОДКЛЮЧЕНИЯ К ИГРЕ, ЗАГРУЗКА ИГРОВОЙ ЛОГИКИ, ЗАГРУЗКА ЗАГРУЗКИ, ЗАГРУЗКА ЗАГРУЗКА ЗАГРУЗКИ ПОТЕРИ СОЕДИНЕНИЯ И ЗАГРУЗКА ГЛАВНОГО МЕНЮ,ЧТО БЫ ПОТОМ ЗАГРУЗИТЬ СВОЮ БАРЖУ. т.е 25-33% игры это тупо симулятор ЗАГРУЗКИ. в две тысячи двадцать четвертом ожидаешь немного большего чем просто ЗАГРУЗКА.

Вообщем и целом я очень сильно разочарован ПВП составляющей, да и игрой в целом.

6個關卡真的體感太少

PVP感覺根本只是硬塞進來的東西
可有可無，制作組還不如把時間花去加強單機跟合作內容
就算沒劇情再多給兩張地圖都比較好

平衡方向有待改進
同類武器也有幾種選擇，但好用的少之又少
堪用的也不多，垃圾槍一堆 (也算是遊戲通病?)
關卡難度提升只是無腦把怪物的數量血量跟攻擊力堆起來，每級難度感覺提血20%
槍械升級要用的素材要打高難關卡，但未升級的槍跑去打高難就異常痛苦
就算是升級了的槍，武器的數值還追不上敵人血量的成長速度

Big Spaghet,1,17.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MassiveLinguini/,"The core game here is great. The enemy variety leaves a little to be desired, interface slightly clunky, and the side missions are (so far) inconsistent.

I am starting to hate the way they've tied health and armor systems into melee. Especially on higher difficulties it's just not feasible to regain health in certain fights.

Additionally the TE-style red/blue rings for dodges and parrys ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ suck. It feels like a duck tape solution to their wanting to implement dark souls-esque timing requiments while filling the screen with swarms of enemies. It becomes and annoying indecipherable mess.

Oh and the ammo replenishment mechanics do not work in boss fights that physically yank your camera away to LOOK AT BIRD when your trying to replenish ammo.

Good 40k game, but there's a lot of jank getting in the way of a great overall experience.

JaBlue,0,144.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198195682054/,"I have 110 hours in the game and it was great until the last patch with all the nerfs. Some heavy hits are almost impossible to dodge (like the chaos marine's flame circle) and at times I get cornered and can't see because my camera's in the wall.

The bots are EXTREMELY BAD. Not only do they not target enemies half the time, but they have no abilities. Just have the bots copy whatever perks you have for that class at least. Enemy bots also focus attacks only on the player if you're unfortunate enough to play alone. Zoanthropes are almost impossible to kill when you have 2 bot teammates and only have a pistol and melee weapon (I was in a public game as Assault and my friend DCed and no one joined).

Instead of pulling a Helldivers move and nerfing the viable/fun weapons, make the other weapons better. The blocking perk feels useless and it takes too long to kill majoris enemies with melee weapons without a parry. As a heavy main I don't ever use the heavy plasma incinerator as it's slow, doesn't do enough damage against majoris+, heats up quick, and takes too long to charge. The other weapons fare much better, but then they nerfed the melta rifle, which I felt never did much damage to extremis+ enemies and requires you to get close while aiming, putting you at a much higher risk.

I don't get how a chaos marine can shoot me point blank as I'm slashing his face.

When choosing a mission, there should be an option to host or join a random squad.

Nerfing the Melta bomb by 70% against bosses defeats the point of it. Hitting that melta is hard and should feel very rewarding.

This game is playing out almost exactly like Helldivers did for me. It was fun, I felt badass, it was rewarding to know patterns, then they hit the game with a bunch of terrible nerfs and made the game more stress than fun and ruined the flow. I haven't played Helldivers much since and I'm starting to feel the same here. What Warhammer should do which Helldivers did right was that instead of making enemies tankier, they threw more at you. This would fit great with this game as it heavily relies on executions and fighting to get armor back.",2024/10/19,en

It tells the story of how three and a half ultramarines defeated just a few million tyrranids and chaos followers. Again attached lobotomized psyker, chaos-thermo-lord-wizard, references to Lord of the Rings and, unlike the first part, not fapable IG girl.
This game, apparently, enough money, so we have:
The scenery in the game is exactly three kinds again: ruins in swamps, city, cemetery in the ruins. The only glimmer of light at the very end: the ruins of cemetery in a warp anomaly.
Enemies are also of three types: tyranids, chaosites, and demon. Though for each type are drawn special, pathos-busting animations of knocking out heresy.
Weapons compared to the tabletop redesigned just to the point of impossibility: from melta made shotgun, from laska sniper, from stormbolter dull machine gun, and from the jumping satchel evil machine unstoppable imba. And they didn't let me dabble in heavy weapons

1)The game presents genetically enhanced superhuman warriors as ordinary overgrown men in sealed lats.
2)Almost the entire game, while in the combat zone, the protagonists walk around without helmets (Strictly forbidden by the Codex Astartes). The phrase of the captain (!) of the Ultramarines (!!!) addressed to the sergeant “Why do you take the Codex Astartes so seriously?” is tantamount to breaking the oath of some Creed regiment.
3)The aforementioned captain, fighting with weapons the average SM would be ashamed of, in armor less flashy than the sergeant next to him.
4)Royals in bushes the size of a necron tomb.

Последняя игрушка по 40к, получившая кучу положительных оценок ещё до выхода. Повествует о том, как три с половиной ультрамарина победили всего-то несколько миллионов тирранидов и хаоситов. Опять прилагается лоботомированный псайкер, хаос-термо-лорд-волшебник, отсылки к Властелину Колец и, в отличии от первой части, не фапабельная ИГшница. Тем не менее, бабло на игру, видимо, хватило, в отличии от первой части, благодаря чему:

Декораций в игре ровно опять три вида: руины в болотах, город, кладбище в руинах. Единственный проблеск света в самом конце: руины кладбища в варп-аномалии.
Врагов тоже три вида: тираниды, хаоситы, демон. Хотя для каждого типа прорисованы особые, пафосные анимации вышибания ереси.
Оружие по сравнению с настолкой переработано просто донельзя: из мелты сделали дробовик, из лазки снайперку, из штормболтера унылый пулемет, а из прыжкового ранца злобную машину неостановимой имбы. И не дали побаловаться тяжелым оружием

Игра преподносит генетически улучшенных воинов-сверхлюдей, как обычных мужиков-переростков в герметичных латах.
Практически всю игру, находясь в зоне боевых действий, главные герои ходят без шлемов (Строжайше запрещено Кодексом Астартес). Фраза капитана (!) Ультрамаринов (!!!), обращённая к сержанту «А чего ты так серьёзно относишься к Кодексу Астартес?» равносильна нарушению присяги каким-нибудь кридским полком.
Упомянутый капитан, воюющий с оружием, которого постыдился бы и обычный десантник, в доспехе менее пафосном чем у сержанта рядом.

FuscusNight,1,77.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FuscusNight/,"It's pretty good, definitely not perfect as it comes with some flaws but it's a well done sequel to the first game.

Visuals
Game's visual aspect looks great, especially considering the absolute chaos you see happening on the screen with so many enemies swarming and things blowing up, with even small attention to detail existing such as the fact you get mud stains on your armour (and blood ofc) as you go through some of the marshy parts of the planet, it looks damn good but due to performance being somewhat shoddy, up scaling is needed which softens the image so people who can't stand temporal softness to an image will not be happy

Optimizaiton








I played through it solo on Veteran, my initial experience was a bit Luke-warm with the first few missions but it didn't take long for me to get more into it, especially since the campaign gets better as you progress it, early missions have this more frequent re-occurring issue that is present when you're playing solo, where certain segments feel like they're not meant for you to be on your own with the two AI partners that share a singular brain cell, such as for an example having to use a flame thrower to push back a swarm of tiny lil' insects whilst dealing with lots of ranged enemies and having to complete some objectives, problem is, the flamer takes you primary weapon away so all you're down to is your pistol for ranged enemies plus enemies in solo mode tend to focus more on the solo player than the two AI partners, so these situations can feel a bit bad . However , this starts becoming less so of a problem at the mid point of the campaign where it starts feeling like they put some more thought into making it more enjoyable when playing solo. The campaign as a whole is really damn good by the end, apart from some stumbles in design where it can very much feel like it's a Co-Op campaign with an optional solo mode from time to time, it's epic, doesn't over stay its welcome , ends on a pretty satisfying note with a spectacular final act fight that was incredibly kick a**.",2024/9/8,en
Ghost,0,50.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cjghost2000/,"Product received for free

Edit: there's been 3 updates to the game since my review, and all they did was Nerf everything people found viable or fun. Awesome don't even bother it just shows how lazy and incompetent these developers are, the little hope I had for this game is gone along with 80+% of the players a month after release.
Original Review:
I hate to leave a negative review as the game has some good qualities to it and I was excited for it, but I'm a little disappointed, it's not as perfect as people make it out to be. A lot of the issues seemed to be overlooked or not talked about. I can only hope they make changes and that it improves, as there's a lot of potential and I want it to be better.
Everything I talk about will be for PVE since I don't care for PVP. I played 2 matches and it felt like destiny 2 which sucks ballsack.
I don't really know where to begin I guess positives-
The campaign felt and played good and the customisation is good and the overall setting, atmosphere, and presentation and the monetization.
now everything else-
Most of the classes in operations, except for 1 or 2 out of the 6 feel underwhelming and unbalanced, and don’t feel like you are playing as a Space Marine. One of the two exceptions I mentioned is the Heavy class he feels great to play from the start, the other I've heard gets better is Tactical. The only reason I haven't played him is that there's no reason to when heavy can do everything and you shouldn't need to spend 10 to 15 hours maxing out a class just for it to feel as fun or competent as Heavy. the other classes need to be buffed to feel more on par with Heavy rather than Heavy getting nerfed. The other classes just don't compare and feel weak which Space Marines shouldn't.
A lot of the weapons and class perks are lackluster/superficial and give the illusion of choice, most classes are pigeonholed into specific weapons and perks and only have 1 viable primary. All classes with access to pistols and melee should have the ability to use all pistols and the knife/chainsword. Not that melee matters or is worthwhile at higher difficulties It's just not fun, Heavy doesn't use melee and is easily the most enjoyable I'm not even going to talk about how useless/restricted Assault is. Maybe bringing back health gain from executions like in the first game could improve gameplay. As for the perks you are always going to pick the ones that give you more ammo and health due to how scarce it is in higher difficulties which you need to play if you want to progress / have more fun. So there's no meaningful choices / variety or builds to be made
Speaking of difficulties, they feel arbitrary and poorly designed. As you go higher you get fewer heals, heal for less, less ammo, fewer grenades. Enemies become tankier bullet sponges and they deal more damage. It's not challenging it's just frustrating not being able to do anything. Difficulties shouldn't feel like a poverty slider that makes you weaker instead there should be more and bigger enemies and maybe deal more damage and tighten parry windows. Most of the missions are monotonous and time-consuming, so overall the replayability is very limited when there's only a couple viable weapons and classes there's no reason to use the others.
All of that is ignoring the server issues desyncing and causing other players to fly, the enemies shooting through walls and matchmaking problems, the AI being terrible and bugging out, progress being lost/reset which should be fixed in time. Some small things like the UI why is there no option to delete created armour and colour presets?, Why are settings being reset or not saved? It feels like my audio settings and motion blur are being reset every time I launch, and there should be options to disable some of the annoying visual effects like vignette and change FOV instead of resulting to mods.
Anyway it's not an awful game but I don't think it's worth $60-$100 maybe wait for it to drop a third in price or until they fix or rebalance everything and add whatever content they have planned as currently its lacking content and any replayability. I just hope the people excessively praising the game and ignoring issues realize that they are doing more harm than good. The classes, melee, difficulty levels, operations and rewards need rebalancing",2024/9/18,en

Минусы: Движок дерьмово работает с разными видеокартами, текстуры противников могут прорисовываться минутами или не рисоваться вообще, графику приходится сильно шакалить, что бы просто модельки были на экране. У меня не последнее железо 3050 Ti, но и не самая плохая видеокарта и по системкам проходит, игра не соответствует заявленным требованиям. Мы на ПК конечно шаманы, но неужели нельзя было оттестировать на разном железе, дабы игроки могли насладится этим пафосом по полной.

After waiting one month after launch to get ultrawide ""support"" the devs put in this half-assed ultrawide update where you're basically looking through telescope. 0 effort at all went into this. Get motion sickness because your character's legs are chopped off and the screen ends right above the head? Better just swallow that vomit according to the devs.

Patch 4.0 is out and still getting weinered down by the devs. They haven't even made a statement on how ass it is or replied to any question/comment about it.

Smollett,1,120.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198144977250/,"Так сейчас не делают.
Сделать коридорный экшен на 8 часов без вот этой вашей мнимой свободы выбора, открытого и пустого мира или с кучей душещипательных историй о каждом из персонажей со своими скелетами в шкафу.
Пфф. Ваха не про это. Ваха никогда не была про все эти сопли. А вот про что Ваха - это и показывает SpaceMarine. Она - про масштаб, пафос, превозмогание и предельную жестокость во всём и ко всему.
Итак, у нас имеется самый что ни на есть обыкновенный экшен от третьего лица. Простой, как три копейки в плане концепции. Вы - лейтенант космических десантников Тит и ваша задача - остановить начавшееся вторжение враждебных инопланетных жуков(ну, допустим) - тиранидов. В вашем распоряжении - болтеры разнообразных видов и размеров - и автоматические, и снайперские, и марксманские и многие другие. В вашем распоряжении цепной или силовой меч, а может и молот, которым можно смачно разбивать целые волны супостатов и натурально превращать их в фарш. В вашем распоряжении несколько видов гранат, при помощи которых можно нести Свет Императора в самые труднодоступные места массовых скоплений противника.
Боевка, при этом, отходит от привычного подхода подобных игр, где оружие ближнего боя используется в крайнем случае или для стелса. Ваш меч - полноценный вид вооружения, которым придется орудовать в той же степени, в которой вы будет стрелять. Для разнообразия добавили возможность блокировать и парировать атаки, что само по себе не самая простая задача, когда противостоишь буквально орде тиранидов. Удачным парированием можно не только отправить противника в нокаут, но еще и восстановить часть брони, чтобы можно было продолжать сражаться, вбивать врагов Императора в землю, разрывать их на куски голыми руками... кхм... В общем, скучать не приходится. Врагов просто дикое количество и зевать времени нет. Вся игра проходит в бешеном темпе с дикой динамикой в стычках и времени передохнуть практически нет.
Но когда оно появляется - сразу возникает возможность полюбоваться местными видами. На ум приходят слова ""Гигантизм"" и ""Масштабность"", собственно, еще две отличительные черты вселенной Вахи. Виды здесь порой просто изумляют и всегда хочет постоять и подольше порассматривать эти огроменные залы, церкви, склепы и прочие сооружения. При этом всё это не статичное - постоянно что-то пролетает мимо, кто-то кричит, кто-то с кем-то ожесточенно сражается. Создается впечатление полномасштабного военного театра и наблюдать за этим крайне интересно. Художники и дизайнеры явно постарались на славу.
Ну, постояли-посмотрели, возвращаемся в замес и на этот раз обратим внимание на то, как это звучит. А звучит это сочно и смачно. Тяжелые шаги десантников, выстрелы болтеров и лазганов, вопли солдат, крики тиранидов - всё озвучено просто шикарно и идеально дополняет картину боевых действий. К сожалению о музыке сказать того же не могу просто потому, что на фоне всех этих атмосферных криков и взрывов из музыки до ушей доносятся разве что звуки запилов без четких мелодий, что не плохо - идеальный фон для происходящего.
Ну и напоследок - напарники. Сразу оговорюсь - боты-союзники тупые, как Магнус. Крайне рекомендуется, особенно на высокой сложности, заиметь парочку друзей и тогда эффектное и красочное крошилово ксеносов будет обеспечено. Прямо начинаешь чувствовать взаимную поддержку и плечо товарища в порой непростых боях и схватках с боссами. Ну, а в отдельные режим ПВЕ-операций без живых людей и соваться смысла нет. Операции эти, кстати, не висят особняком, а проходят параллельно основной кампании и дополняют её, а иногда бывают и интереснее того, чем в данный момент занимается Тит. Есть ещё ПВП режим, но лично я никогда не был любителем такого в кооперативных по сути играх, да и матча так и не удалось найти ни разу, но не скажу, что пожалел.
В завершении, хочется отметить, что настолько пропитанной духом сорокатысячника игры не видел уже давно. Теперь, если кто-то спросит о том, как приобщиться к этой мрачной и жестокой вселенной - ответ будет готов. Лучше СпейсМарина для среднестатистического геймера на сегодняшний день способа не существует.

Pourquoi je ne le recommande pas alors ?
La campagne n'a rien d'exceptionnel et est assez courte, un peu dommage pour un jeu qui est avant tout solo, en disons... 9h le campagne est terminé.

Comment justifier le prix alors ?
Et bien, le multijoueur qui est... passable...
Le mode PVE qui est en réalité le truc le plus original n'a que 6 missions différentes ce qui est vraiment dommage.
Le système de progression est correcte mais un peu trop long à mon goût.
Pas de possibilité de créer de partie privé et SURTOUT, vous allez en quitter des parties, il y a 6 classes et pas de doublons.
En gros vous allez prier que personne n'ai déjà pick la classe que vous voulez.
C'est déjà vraiment chiant mais en plus il fallait que le matchmaking soit tout simplement inexistant, il n'y en a juste pas.
Vous allez souvent rejoindre une partie qui a déjà commencé sans possibilité de le choisir ou non, et en plus vous allez souvent vous faire kick pour x ou y raion, bref c'est frustrant.

Le gameplay en lui-même maintenant.
Un tps classique, en réalité assez décevant pour un jeu WH40k, le feeling des armes est pas là, il y a au total une quinzaine d'armes je dirai, mais en réalité seulement quelques une sont viables, on passera les milles et unes variante de bolter inutiles.
Le bolter d'ailleurs, parlons-en, il ne fait juste pas de dégât, obligé de vider un chargeur de 45 coups pour tuer un monstre de base, avec un total de seulement 5 chargeurs...
Vous voyez venir le problème, on se retrouve quasiment tout le temps à court de munition, ce qui casse énormément le fun.
Le corps à corps maintenant, de mon côté, je dirai que ça passe mais c'est loin d'être fun à jouer, contrairement à SM1 ici pas de régen de vie et impossible d'annuler en coup, en bref, vous jouerez seulement avec les parades 90% du temps car le CàC n'est juste pas une option viable vu que les mobs vous explosent au CàC.
Les capacités des classes qui sont mais alors pas fun du tout en dehors de l'étendard, et l'arbre de talent qui n'en n'est pas vraiment un, c'est juste des passifs qui se débloque au fur et à mesure mais qui ne change absolument rien au gameplay.
Du style, votre arme principale inflige 10% de dégât supplémentaire... Loin mais alors très loin d'une personnalisation de classe comme à la Darktide qui est pourtant assez simple.
On est loin de ce que peut offrir un Deep Rock avec les Overclock qui sont ultra fun.

Mention négative spéciale pour les vagues d'ennemies, je m'explique, dans chaque mission on a une phase où il faut défendre un lieu contre des vagues d'ennemis, sauf que, contrairement à un World War Z où c'est satisfaisant car les zombies arrivent dans des quelques chemins, ici les monstres arrivent d'absolument partout, on est quasiment instantanément au CàC, y a pas de ligne de défense et c'est ultra frustrant.

En résumé, SP2 est un bon jeu, mais loin d'être satisfaisant, je ne ressens pas le fun qu'un Darktide peut procurer pour un jeu qui est un swarm shooter. Très vite répétitif et cumulé avec un gameplay assez plat on se fait vite chier.
Je n'ai évidemment cité que les points négatifs pour moi, bien qu'il y ait des choses que j'ai apprécié du style l'animation ou la personnalisation au niveau de l'apparence, ce n'est clairement pas suffisant pour bien noté le jeu.",2024/9/18,fr

На данный момент 6часов только в сюжетной компании игры.
При чём играла на пару с знакомым всё время после пролога.
Но даже игра в компании не спасла игру...
Обзор обновлю по мере освоения контента, а пока:
1) боевая система даже из того что заявлено крайне мало вариативности и контента имеет число огнестрела/комбо атак,
А к этому прибавьте то что из 5ти автоматом отличий нет ДЕ ФАКТО никаких.
Так же как и комбо не ощущаются как то по особому полное ощущение что кроме как пкм/пкм/пкм ничего и не нужно.
И ""узлов"" которые должны формировать ядро разнообразия мало, и того что есть по факту ещё меньше ибо смысла не имеет даже чисто из ""хочу"" не ощущается просто автомат 2 отличным от автомата 1 или автомата 3, ну нету отличий в ощущениях.
В прологе игра вас учит парировать и уклонятся а так же добивающим выстрелам соло цели, но тут же игра будет забрасывать толпами кидая всех врагов на вас без разбору не пытаясь в 88%ов случаев создавать из разных типов врагов и проектировки локаций интересные ситуации, запомнилась только локация где мы прятаясь за разрушаемыми статуями отстреливались от снайперов, это единственная интересная ситуация была на 6часов сюжетки (не прошли а наиграли)
типов врагов только 5 и 2 босса и так 5 часов до появления хаоситов, которые по сути рескины единственное отличие хаоситов то что большие мобы хаоса (космодесант хаоса) умеют телепортироваться, в остальном они идентичны своим аналогам у тиранидов.
В итоге миссии это череда 1нообразной каши из 5и типов врагов иногда появляются 1 из 2ух боссов всё.

Перечислять мелочи касательно недостатков боевой системы можно ещё долго не хватит символов обзора.

2) сюжета словно бы нет, тита не развивают, все персонажи помимо тита пустышки ни характера ни личности, никаких интересных диалогов или катсцен, химии между рядовым и титом в 1ой части когда они спорили на тему кодекса Астартес больше чем химии между титом и всеми персонажами 2ки вместе взятыми, и это не гипербола, просто в этой сцене в 1 химия была был конфликт который закладывал основу сюжета, а в 2ки просто нету ни сюжета ни диалогов ни какого то интереса к повествованию, драматургия не знакома разработчикам игры от слова совсем.
Даже когда были моменты когда ожидаешь максимально логичных тропов в рамках ситуации, их не было.
Такое ощущение что весь сюжет написала и срежиссировала нейросеть, и ещё раз ЭТО НЕ ГИПЕРБОЛА, это 1 в 1 так.

3) оптимизация у меня железо выше рекомендованных, я не сталкаш я не графодр()очер я поставила на низкие всю графику. у меня 2070super/i5 9600/16ram 3200. И при этом у меня фпс стабильно скачет от 40 до 60ти, и я понимаю те сцены где большая локация куча врагов и союзников, но почему в коридорных локациях падает фпс? на низких.
НИЗКИХ, моё железо 4 года назад было предтоповым считай особенно видяха, а тут игра которая ничем не выделяется на низких так падает в фпс, а местами фпс падал до 16цати, боюсь представить что будет за слайд шоу на минимальных указанных требованиях.

У меня есть ещё очень много что сказать но не поместиться в отзыв всё но основные претензии озвучила.

Если вы далеки от вахи и вам пофигу на канон, для вас это просто казуальная плохенькая игра с малой вариативностью и зевотным сюжетом.

Если вы довераст 20цатилетней выдержки как и я, кто имеет хотя бы 200часов подкастов прослушанных и чтения вики/кодексов, вам будет больно от бреда по бэку.

А если вы настольшик эксперт бэка, поберегите сердце, боюсь представить как больно будет вам.

НЕ покупайте игру за полный ценник, вы ничего не упускаете не поиграв в неё, эту игру брать меньше чем за 75%ов скидки не стоит, хотя даже так она не стоит денег, лучше переходите на импортозамещение.

А я продолжу играть ради создания видео обзора, буду страдать за вас... памагите Q...Q",2024/9/11,ru

Я наиграл почти 20 часов и могу кое-что сказать
1. ПВЕ и Сюжетная кампания: Играются просто великолепно, когда на вас прёт орда ксеносов и ты со своими братьями уничтожаешь их пачками это вызывает экстаз, особенно когда вы все чуть не погибли, Босс файты хорошие, разнообразные и разбавляют геймплей .
2. ПВП: Хорошее рубилово между игроками, Режимы простые не дать не взять, играется драйвово
3. Серьёзных багов или лагов за это время я не нашел, разве что после загрузки на контрольной точке у персонажей пропадает голос на несколько реплик, но что больше всего раздражает это ДОЛГИЕ загрузки(надеюсь на релизе будет быстрее)
4. Если игра будет развиваться как на дорожной карте что нам представили, то будет заебись!

ObDivanKenobi,1,36.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/obdivan/,"Как Rogue Trader это лучшая RPG по Вархаммеру, так и Space Marine 2 это лучший экшен по Вархаммеру. Атмосфера, постановка и арт просто шикарны, всё это сделано с максимальной любовью к первоисточнику и с первых минут погружает в атмосферу мира вечной войны.
Играть строго с друзьями в кооперативе, или на низкой сложности - ИИ болванчики именно что болванчики и годятся только на то, чтобы поднимать тебя, если ты упал, а ронять тебя в соло будут очень часто, потому что врагов всегда много, и бьют они больно.

Геймплейно всё ровно - пушки стреляют, оружие ближнего боя бьёт, враги красиво разлетаются на запчасти - но не более того. Это чистокровный олдскульный шутер даже без прокачки.

Главный недостаток кампании - она преступно короткая, часов на 10. Видимо в Saber изучили жалобы на однообразие первой части и решили проблему радикально, кампания настолько короткая, что однообразие просто не успевает проявиться и надоесть.

PVE миссии (отдельные от кампании) прекрасны, проходят на отдельных специально собранных картах и по постановке не уступят кампании. Плюс в PVE появляется прокачка. Недостатков ровно два: на высоких сложностях с рандомными сопартийцами (или тем более ботами) делать совершенно нечего, и их тоже преступно мало, всего 6 штук.

PvP... Оно есть, оно командозависимое из-за высокого ТТК и оно болеет проблемами с неткодом (высокий пинг, десинки). За отсутствием альтернатив оно сгодится и даже может быть весёлым, но из-за командозависимости и отсутствия ребаланса команд можно легко попасть в цикл бесконечных поражений.

-----------------------------------------------
В общем и целом игра, несмотря на то, что короткая, оставляет гораздо больше эмоций, чем безликие открытые миры на 100+ часов, и однозначно стоит своих денег, особенно в кооперативе.

LionSaurus,1,87,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005529409/,"Solid enough game - it does what it says on the tin - be a giant super human and smack bugs around. Story seems fun so far, operations are good (but with a caveat) and I like the melee and gunplay. After some more time in the game (both story and operation) I can delve a bit deeper into things.

Story - 7/10. It's pretty straight forward, though there might be a twist or turn in there (that I'm sure you have already gotten spoiled through various news media anyway). Not much to say. Simple, but cool.

World building - 10/10. Top marks. The maps, the battlefields, the chaos, the swarms, the absolute gore - it's just fantastic. It's beautiful and disturbing and just beyond anything I expected. Game teaches you about the 40k world and the immersion it provides gets you really stuck into it making you want to know more.

Gameplay - 9/10. Gameplay is marvelous. Though I'm still struggling with the timing of dodges and parries I've occasionally gotten in a flow where I just become a blender, chopping xeno scum to the left, doding xeno scum to the right, and firing of headshots as quick reaction. I for sure need to get better at the combat flow, but I can easily see how good it can be if you get good at it and once you do it's going to be euphoric.

Operations - 8/10, but with a caveat. The mainstay of the game in my opinion. It has huge potential and even the little I've played is so much fun. It reminds me of the golden days of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer (if you know, you know). However the biggest issue is playing without a full team - because you are stuck trying to connect with random players and that is it's own bag of worm. From people with bad connection, to people who won't go to the mission area, to people who just afk. I honestly prefer having bots over the random players, but unfortunately you can't choose to add bots - you have to hope nobody tries to join. The fact that we can't add bots makes me want to subtract 2 points from the score on it's own because the issues with random players can be very aggravating. They need to add an option to add bots..

Endless War - haven't played =p Might try it some day, but not a big PvP so - check others opinion on this game mode.

Would I recommend? I think, yes. If you enjoy the concept of loop gameplay from operations, and you have a full team (or the devs add option to add bots) I think you will have a blast. I know I will once I'm done with the random player issues.

Oh, and a final note. Stay away from the ultimate edition and cosmetic DLC's and all that. Even if you pay for it you still have to unlock it. So you buy for the right to unlock the cosmetics, but you still have to spend requisition on it which takes super long to grind. My biggest regret is paying for the ""cosmetic options"" I don't have enough points to unlock lol.",2024/9/7,en
WiseGuy,1,364.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wiseguy99/,"Review has been edited to reflect the recent changes made at time of writing. To see the original negative review, check the bottom of this review.

Well I'll be damned. They actually managed to dial back enough changes to make the game a blast to play again. Combined with the new buffs to bolt weapons and friendly AI damage against bosses, I can safely say that this game has earned its place back among my go-to games to play. I still have a few gripes, like how the AI uses its abilities (or doesn't) at inconvenient times, but they are ultimately outweighed by the enjoyment of the game-play itself. I can't wait for the new weapon and what else is to come in the future. As long as they aren't updates like Patch 4.



Original review:

I used to love this game to bits, and the Operations mode was something I would play daily. However, the recent patch has made the mode practically unplayable on higher difficulties. Many minutes are wasted by slogging through a mission with wave upon wave of Warriors spamming projectiles at me, only to die near the end when the game decides I don't deserve to be rewarded for my time and kills me by sending 15 Warriors and a pair of Zoanthropes.

Helldivers 2 showed you how badly you can ♥♥♥♥ up a game when you decide to make it harder when it is already plenty difficult, and Saber Interactive decided to follow it as a tutorial. Ironically, Helldivers 2 is now it a better position than this game, and so I may decide to spend my time with it instead. Very disappointing.",2024/10/20,en

hampstr,0,5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hamataro/,"Product received for free

Early negative review: seems like if Gear of War if it didn't have a shred of humanity, and looked really good. It's middling in a lot of ways, and the one way it is exceptional is that it is like Zoolander: really really really ridiculously good looking.

Graphically demanding, and while it runs fairly well, it has an upscaling menu that bears some dire implications for the future of graphics (AI upscaling presented as balanced option, native resolution presented as ultra-premium quality option).

Overheats your PC for fairly basic gameplay. Guns are good, slightly underwhelming, melee is a very lightweight system with a dash of Arkham and not particularly deep. Could be that it gets better, but I'm not in any hurry to find out. Once again, it feels like Gears of War but with the armor system replacing the cover system. Not in love with the tone, it's very self-serious and dire and slow, and you run into a lot of characters that are just so flat and one dimensional. Not much popcorn appeal there, but it's also hard to take with any gravitas since the game is just about big silly action figures ripping apart lizards.

It also lacks the mortality and urgency of Gears characters, since space marines are basically invincible superheroes in their universe walking past expendable nameless IG that they'd be willing to sacrifice without a second's hesitation. Grim, serious (verging on joyless) invincibility fantasy is just an odd wavelength to try and play along with in a basic TPS.

Adammaniaco,1,108.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061793951/,"I preordered the 100-euro version after knowing that Saber had some ex-Bungie employees, and oh boy do I not regret it. Some of that classic Halo DNA must be in this game, because I wasn’t so hooked with and online PvE mode since the original Halo ODST firefight mode.

Without taking into account the excellent campaign mode (LEAD ME TO THE SLAUGHTER) and the PvP, I’ve already sink +100 hours playing Operations Mode in all difficulty levels. Each time you finish an operation, you get points, new armor, weapons, perks and more. With 6 classes and their distinct playstyles to level up, the amount of content included in the base game is insane, every post-match customization had me building different Space Marines of all aesthetics, colors, chapters and combinations imaginable.
Since I started playing, I went to my family’s house to retrieve my old 40k minis (Black Templars and Tyranids, very appropriate), read +5 novels (The End and the Death and the Ravenor trilogy), visited my local Games Workshop retail store (first time since I was 16), and purchased and started painting some new Black Templar units (the whole Primaris upgrade is new to me, the minis are quite bigger).

XMarkos,1,42.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/markuno/,"Плюсы:

1) Очень красивый визуал, разглядывать всё можно долго и сломать клавишу F12.
2) Добивания красочные и на каждое оружие они свои.
3) Толпы тиранид - это тупо весело.
4) Персонажи в компании прописаны достаточно интересно для сверхвоинов в броне, знающих только войну.
5) По сравнению с первой частью и стрельба, и ближка сильно прокачаны. Стрелять и бить очень красочно, разница, на самом деле, и между дакками, и между милишкой хорошо чувствуется. Силовой меч - one love.
6) Коопные миссии напрямую связаны с сюжетом, благодаря чему понимаешь, что всё на Тите не сошлось и не только на него можно положиться.
7) Сюжетку можно проходить в коопе.

Минусы:

1) Игра довольно короткая, сильно надолго в ней не засядешь
2) Добиваний из-за спины нет, как и, допустим, сверху.
3) С введением хаоситов толпы исчезают, что грустно, они в целом печальнее, чем тираниды
4) Из игровых классов - только разный набор спейсмаринов, ни апотекария. ни библиария ты тут не встретишь (для меня проблем в этом нет, потому что и был смысл показать, что ""просто маринчики"" не одинаковые так-то)
5) Всего шесть миссий коопов, которые быстро надоедают.
6) Косметики на хаоситов просто нет, а хаоситы есть.

Добавления:

1) В игре критических багов я не увидел, изредка бывают дропы серверов, но как будто вчера это даже не игра виновата, а Стим дропнулся.
2) В мультиплеер я побегал немного совсем, но свой кайф в нём словить можно. Сам по себе он вроде достаточно самобытен и балансный.
3) Есть в коопе багованные способности, делающие некоторые (почти все) классы слишком сильными, например, бесконечный боезапас на тяжёлом оружии. Надеюсь, их скоро пофиксят.
4) В качестве визуала тут есть открываемые элементы брони, у каждого класса свой итоговый вид, в целом, мне зашло, но особо сильно не разгуляешься, всё же кодекс - это важно. Например, из Бастиона (с щитом бегает и милишкой, как правило, меч) тут почти вся броня с рясой. Это в бэке есть у Тёмных Ангелов, у Чёрных Храмовников и у почётной стражи Ультрамара. Все расцветки можно в игре взять. В целом. раскрасить его можно в любой цвет, но либо у тебя почти стандартная броня, либо с рясой. Просто хотя бы красивой брони без рясы тупо нет. Примерно тоже самое у снайпера, у него большинство брони с обмоткой эмблемы легиона, а по итогу и вовсе маскхалат. Действительно красивая и во всей подробностях броня есть у тяжёлой поддержки, но смысл понятен.

ChronicNerditis,1,40.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066256617/,"Simply put: This game is extraordinary. Not only is it visually stunning and highly immersive, it is a game made for the target audience through and through. Loved every minute and can't wait for more after 9 hrs of play.

The story is rich, the characters are well done, and the atmosphere is palpable throughout the campaign. More than anything else though: Space Marine 2 is a game that makes me feel like I was heard. The game stays true to the core of 40k and incorporates much of the existing lore into an amazing rendition of that world.

The combat system takes some getting used to but it is akin to Helldivers and Gears of War blended with a somewhat ""Souls-like"" play style. Dodging, timed strikes and blocks, run gunning, and simply brute force are all options. Different combat strategies are rewarded differently with different enemy types and I enjoyed the challenge. On Veteran difficulty you absolutely have to be more careful and consider what enemies you are fighting our else you will get absolutely mogged. The combat is addictive and exactly what I think of when I read a 40k book. The flashlights are also fairly lore accurate which is awesome haha.

I highly recommend this game:

Pros:
-Fantastic landscape and world design. Highly rich environments with stunning visuals and details
-Plays fantastic. The combat system works great with minimal bugs and the game appropriately rewards strategy
-True to the lore and ties in nicely with the original game
-Very palpable passion in the writing and development. This game was made for true 40k fans and new fans alike. It leaves you excited to play again.
-Great PvP and PvE coop options

Cons:
-Audio bugs for me have been most common. Muffled audio randomly after cutscenes or death is my most frequent bug but even then are not persistent and resolved with rebooting the game.
-I wish the campaign was a smidge longer. I got a solid 8hrs out of my first playthrough on veteran, and I stopped to look at things and explore the NPCs conversations as I went. This is somewhat made-up for in the coop mission mode.
-Some of the enemies are serious bullet sponges and when playing solo campaign the enemies tend to target you far more than your NPC allies. Normally this would be ok, but when cooping the enemies target everybody in a more balanced way and that did make the missions more enjoyable simply because the mobs don't drown you in harass on top of tougher enemies.

There are also some obvious areas where the game can be expanded, and I really look forward to it.

I have not yet played the PvP heavily but in the brief time I did try it I enjoyed it.

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you are a 40k fan this game is worth every penny of full price. If you are a Helldivers/Gears of War/Halo fan you will probably love it too, and this game makes a decent into to 40k but you will have to google some things (Such as Space Marine structuring and who the Emperor is, but don't worry YouTube is rich in lore vids).",2024/9/15,en

Combat has weight and impact to it, the marines look good, the tyranids are relentless and the corridors and areas feel atmospheric. I mainly have small complaints like that bolters could have a little more punch to their sounds, blocking being a little confusing at the beginning and the menus being annoying to navigate with a controller as the cursor slows down A LOT on some UI elements but it sure does feel good to just have a game you can just play for fun without much modern nonsense in the way of just playing it. I'm also enjoying the photo mode.

I do have one big complaint already which is that while playing the campaign alone I almost lost one fight due to lag. Felt really odd and kind of sad that otherwise such an awesome fight was rubberbanding severely.

I never expected a sequel to one of my guilty pleasure games but I'm so happy it exists! This game is such a huge improvement to the first one. The story was so fun and soooo sick. The addition of easy drop-in, drop-out for co-op was fantastic. Visuals were wayyy better than I expected and might be one of the nicest looking games I've ever played (at the time of this writing? lmao).
The only gripe I have is with the lack of information presented for pvp. It took quite a while to get into my first match and I had no idea if I was actually gonna get in since it gave me no indication besides ""Waiting for other Battle Brothers"" in a full lobby. Turns out I was waiting for the match that I joined to end... I think. It would also be nice to have one sentence explaining each of the pvp modes. Switching armor parts instead of choosing a chapter was also confusing.

Shrimpy,1,94.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040086041/,"I Like it but thats not the whole story..
Space Marine 2 is well set in the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K. As a continuation of the OG Space Marine Game from 2011, it attempts to bring the one-decade old formula of bolter shooting and chainsawsword slashing to 2024. However, it struggles to do so and is very expensive on top. I really enjoy playing the game and will most likely cotinue to play it. But it has some notable flaws and if you are thinking about buying the game you should consider the following.


If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k and a sucker for the (totally not overrepresented) Ultra Marines, its a awesome implementation in the Universe.
The game is a well representation (even if a little generalized) of the lore and atmosphere that makes up the core of 40k for me. It allows you to stomp Tyranids and match yourself with . In the Coop PVE and the PVP mode, the Customization System allows you to tailor your Character into your favorite Space Marine Chapter or Chaos Legion. The Lovecraftian horrors of the 40k universe are well-represented, making the story engaging despite its somewhat bleak plot and dialogue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, if you're not deeply invested in the 40k Universe, Space Marine 2 falls short. The gameplay feels outdated, with clunky mechanics that haven't evolved much since the original game . Combat can be fun, but it's often repetitive and lacks the refinement seen in other smilar modern titles. The writing is another weak point, with dialogue that ranges from uninspired to outright poor. Online multiplayer is plagued by long wait times, frequent connection errors, and bugs that, for example, can make enemies invisible (very fun), breaking immersion and gameplay. The game has a very hard time to offer anything beyond its niche appeal, making its steep tag hard to justify for newcomers to the world of 40K aswell as casual players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Space Marine 2 delivers exactly what I want out of a Warhammer 40k game: a grimdark experience in a universe that lacks hope with the permanent thread of extinction for a human race lost in endless external and internal conflict. However, it struggles to appeal beyond its core audience due to outdated gameplay, technical issues, and blunt writing. If you're a diehard fan of 40k, you'll find enjoyment in this game despite its flaws. For everyone else, who just want to stomp some Aliens and blow up stuff, there are better and less expensive options.",2024/9/11,en

Autistic,1,11.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/seplim/,"Странная игра. И хорошая и плохая одновременно.

Отличительная черта любой игры для меня это геймплей и он здесь ниже среднего. Может быть потому что я играл на норме мне так показалось. Благо игра проходится за 10 часов максимум. Под конец, конечно, разгоняешься и ты уже по-ветерански быстро нажимаешь на квитайм нападки ксеносов и хаоситов, даже начинает нравится.

Но хотелось бы глубины: уникальные добивания, скиллы, пассивки, даже задания по типу убейте с боевого ножа 200 противников были бы в тему - всё таки 2024 год на дворе. А как многие заметили игра сделана по инструкциям 2010 года.

А вот что собственно хорошее в игре так это крутейшая постановка. Катсцены и ролики на должном уровне. История незатейлива и проста, но в тоже время способна увлечь.

Срежессировано так что погружаешься прям. Хочется орать в битве ""Во имя Императора!"", когда идешь вместе с астра милитарум в бой. С братьми журить адептус механикус за чванство.

Компаньоны - прописанные герои, а не болванчики, что радует. Прикипаешь к ним даже.

Сюжет моё почтение и старикам угодили, продолжив старую конву про артефакт. И с фанбазой заигрывают показывая тиранидов, боевую технику империума, хаоситов, некронские руины. И новичкам тоже вроде должно быть более менее понятно о чём речь. База - одним словом.

Мультик, ну он есть. А зачем? Ну тем кому недостаточно вахи в жизни, наверное.

В итоге: БРУТАЛЬНО, КРОВАВО, ЭПИЧНО. Рекомендую, но денег жалко. Не стоит она данной суммы, но когда видишь в титрах сплошь русские фамилии и cumis enjoer`а - уже и не жалко вроде. Говорю же: странно.",2024/9/9,ru

Justro,1,23.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slayerjustro666/,"This is by far my GOTY contender for 2024. I will not argue with people who don't agree for stupid reasons. The story is so stupidly incredible and epic. It fits perfectly for a Warhammer 40k game. The gameplay can at times be a little yanky and rough but is for the most part perfectly great and fun. Ripping a tyranid open from the middle and being drenched in its blood never gets old.

The operations game mode is so much fun, playing as my own space marine completing missions really is amazing. Even replaying the same missions doesn't get old.

The pvp game mode is the best pvp in any game I have ever played. I never liked playing pvp until I tried it in this game. However it is a bit unbalanced as some classes are absolute dogsh*t in pvp. Or at least on some gamemodes. I'm sure it will improve.

The customization is incredible, all that I am missing is more customization for heretic factions, which I don't doubt will come later considering how many people want it.

The only complaints for this game I have seen are: No widescreen support (Which will come to the game in september, just check the roadmap) , Oh I don't wanna connect to epic games services (Doesn't make the game bad, and is only there so you can play crossplay), The AI companions are so bad that I can't play the campaign solo (Literally a skill issue???)
This is finally a game that is not pay to win and it is clear that the devs reallly care about the game. In my eyes this game is joining baldurs gate 3 for being an actually good game in modern times. Yes some cosmetics will cost money, but all other content coming to the game is free. So people need to stop complaining about this game, because it is simply breathtaking.

In summary, this game is worth every penny. I bought Ultra Edition instead of Gold Edition even if it only gives me a cool cosmetic for Ultramarines (and I really dislike ultramarines) but I still don't regret it. I would have bought this game if it cost $150 base edition. Good that it doesn't but still, It is worth the money to me personally. Now keep in mind, I love warhammer 40k and have done for a while so I am a bit biased. But for a Warhammer 40k fan, this game is like the game of my dreams. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? BUY IT NOW!

— Инквизитор Титус Дрейк

По моему мнению, Space Marine 2 стоит оценивать в двух плоскостях - непосредственно как игру и как продукт по вселенной бесконечной войны.

С уверенностью можно сказать, что на данный момент, в плане визуализации ваховской эстетики, всего этого ""болтер порно"", пафосного превозмогания и прочих атрибутов, Спасти Марину 2 является лучшим представителем. Для фаната и человека хотя бы мало-мальски интересующегося, игра просто настоящий подарок. Художники великолепно справились со своей задачей. Архитектура, дизайн внутренних помещений, элементов брони и оружия. Хотели лицезреть во всей красе легендарный Baneblade? - пожалуйста. Может титан класса ""Император""? - держите! Правда, с некоторыми оговорками, но все же! Стрелялы стреляют, молоты смачно шмякают, а суровые суповары несут в массы свет Императора и цитаты с пацанских пабликов, брат. Тут игра свои 10/10 полностью заслуживает. Не хватает разве что эпического размаха.

Размышления порождают ересь. Ересь порождает возмездие.
— Эпиграф к книгам про Грегора Эйзенхорна

В то же время, дизайн уровней и некоторые механики игры, отсылают нас прямо с порога в 2000ые. Признаться честно, такой линейности и невидимых стен, буквально в паре метров от единственного пути вперед, я не видел давно. Cтарые добрые QTE на месте. Так же стоит сказать о выборе сложности. Игра нигде не говорит об этом (даже наоборот, вводит в заблуждение), но два последних уровня сложности, очевидно балансировали под кооператив, не под соло прохождение. 2 ИИ болванчика ни то чтобы совсем бесполезны, но на харде, их участливости просто уже не хватает. Поэтому, если играете один и желаете сохранить нервы и положительный вайб, не стройте из себя Папича, выбирайте первые два.
Кампания в среднем проходится часов за 6-8. Этого вполне достаточно. Сбита она плотно, по соотношению событий, разнообразия, эпика и каких то филлерных моментов. Заскучать не успеете.
То что продлит жизнь проекту это пве миссии и пвп контент. От пвп сводит олдскулы. Он очень примитивный и отсылает нас ко временам Квейк арена и Анриал Торнамент. На фоне других конкурентов сильно на любителя ретро. А вот пве это местная жемчужина. Тут в отличие от кампании, есть и выбор классов, прокачка персонажа и оружия, выбор перков и детальная кастомизация всего! Можете слепить себе любимого Кровавого Ворона из детства и воровать у тиммейтов например аптечки из под носа. Все по лору! Миссий кстати всего пока 6. Хотя они весьма разнообразны и местами превосходят даже кампанию, этого катастрофически мало! Реиграбельность у них ровно до тех пор, пока вы не прокачаете любимую болт-винтовку и не откроете прикольный элемент брони. Справедливости ради, разработчики обещают плотно поддерживать игру и добавлять кучу контента в будущем. Будь то новые миссии, карты и режимы для пвп, а так же косметика. Отдельно хочется кинуть камень в огород неткода и мачмейкинга. Они отвратительно реализованы. Бесконечные загрузки от каждого действия на этапе подбора игроков. Тебя может закинуть в игру с человеком на том же классе, что и ты и тебе придется либо его менять либо выходить и снова ждать загрузку. Нередки случаи разрыва соединения, а вернуться в игру уже невозможно.

As an enjoyer of 40k its nice to be eating good again.

This is a masterpiece, I haven't played a game that has made me this happy in a long time. The gameplay, the lore, the graphics, all of it sings of love and care. This game has so many little details that have made me and my friends stop and appreciated them (not mentioning which in order to avoid spoiling).

The gameplay is visceral and responsive, simple to pick up but with some dept to it.
The lore, according to my more learned friends as I am but a novice in the 40k ways, is very good, and they took great care with some details.
And the graphics are beautiful, the contrast between the amazing visceral displays in combat and the beautiful but war thorn landscape around is amazing.

This topped off with non-predatory monetisation, only cosmetics can be bought, and even then there are plenty to earn in game, the future updates are free and will bring so many wonderful things is such a breath of fresh air.

I know some people had a couple of bugs, and I too experienced some, nothing game breaking, but some crashes and some goofy physics in cutscenes. I am hoping today's patch addressed that for new players.

Всё это в концентрированном виде постоянно присутствует на экране. Не менее важно и то, что авторам удалось совместить механики стрельбы и ближнего боя, а также спроектировать боевые ситуации так, что игра не теряет ощущения свежести до самого финала.

结论：中规中矩的战锤40k第三人称射击游戏，没有什么非常出彩的地方。但是玩起来还不错。从没关的挑战上看，Darktide还是对各种数据有着更多的研究，这一代更像是个普通砍砍游戏，没有太多的配合和技能讲究。画面不错，音乐也不错，气氛也不错。目前不支持宽屏，根据roadmap九月份就加入超宽屏支持。皮肤是一堆，喜欢战锤的倒也不是很亏。各项升级都是体现了肝的样子，看起来需要刷很久。

最后吐槽：本人最讨厌Primaris，GW就是喜欢强推自己的棋子。我就是标准30k玩家。为了不吃书，开始往30k里填情节，填故事。Siege of terra系列里的Sons of the selenar就加入了这个狗屁primaris的基因种子，好好好。primaris配U团，真是摆明了的营销棋子策略。最讨厌马桶盖战团，最讨厌primaris，两者兼具，负负得正。但是我变得更恶心了。Horus看着都要吐了，Fulgrim的JJ也要吐了，Magnus脑袋爆浆，Mortarion浑身上下涌出了白色的液体，Angron因为太恶心所以打算砍掉自己的脑袋然后吃了它。就这样，非常恶心。",2024/9/6,zh-cn

จากประสบการณ์ที่เริ่มเล่นตั้งแต่ Day 1 **แบบเข้าถึงล่วงหน้า**
นี่คือเกมแอ็คชัน ผจญภัย สวมบทบาทที่ดีที่สุด ใน ณ. ตอนนี้ หากพูดถึงข้อดีและข้อเสียของเกมนี้:

ข้อดี
- ระบบกราฟิก: เข้าขั้น ""ประทับใจแบบไม่ผิดหวังเลย""
เนื่องจาก ได้ติดตามตั้งแต่ข่าวการประกาศเกมนี้ รวมไปถึง การโฆษณาระบบเกมเพลย์แบบ Demo
นี่คือ **เกมในชีวิตของผมเกมแรก** ที่รู้สึกว่า ไม่มีการดาวน์เกรดใดๆทั้งสิ้น
""Demo มายังไง!! เกมจริงก็มาแบบนั้น!!""

- ระบบเนื้อเรื่อง: มีความ Hype อย่างมาก
ทีมงานทำระบบดังกล่าว ในสเกลที่ใหญ่มาก ทำให้ผู้เล่นรู้สึก มีอารมณ์ร่วมไปกับเกมได้อย่างไม่ยากเย็น

โหด มันส์ ครบทุกรูปแบบ
ทางทีมงาน ทำการบ้านมาดีมากๆ ด้วยรูปแบบ และธีมของจักรวาลนี้ จึงมาครบหมด


ไม่ผิดหวังแน่นอน มีความฉลาด และท้าทาย
ด้วยความที่เป็นทีมงานเดียวกันกับ Crysis 2, Killing Floor 2 และ
เห็นชื่อก็รู้เลย

แต่งจนเพลิน ไม่มีที่ติ
มีความหลากหลายเป็นอย่างมาก ถ้าใครที่เป็นแฟนจักรวาลนี้อยู่แล้ว บอกเลยว่า ""ฟินแบบ*2""

เหมือนกำลังดูหนัง ที่เราควบคุมตัวละครได้
""เสียงปืน และกระสุนที่พุ่งใส่ร่างศัตรู"", ""เสียงดาบที่เฉียนเนื้อศัตรู"", ""เสียงกระฉากเนื้อออกเป็นชิ้นๆ""
รวมไปถึง เสียงพากย์ของตัวละครที่มีอารมณ์ร่วมไปกับเหตุการณ์
ทุกอย่างนี้

เกมนี้ มีระบบบรรยายไทย ไม่ต้องห่วงเรื่อง การแปลภาษา ตามทันได้ทุกสถานการณ์

:
ถึงแม้ว่า จักรวาลของเกมนี้ มีความยิ่งใหญ่มากกว่า Helldivers 2 แน่นอน
แต่ระบบเนื้อเรื่องเกมนี้ ที่ย้ำว่า ยังคงมีการประทะกัน แค่เผ่า Tyranids ส่วนใหญ่
ในทางกลับกัน Helldivers 2



เมื่อเล่นเป็นเวลานาน จะเริ่มรู้สึกเบื่อ เพราะภารกิจยังคงไม่หลากหลายพอ
(ขึ้นอยู่กับผู้เล่นแต่ละคน และรอการอัพเดทต่อไป )

มีเพียงเล็กน้อยมากๆ เช่น การสปอนศัตรูอัดหน้า เป็นต้น
(แต่ถือว่ามีน้อยมากๆ ใน Day 1 หากเปรียบเทียบกับเกมอื่นๆ)

มีการแปลที่ดี แต่ยังไม่ดีเยี่ยม มีการใช้คำบางคำ ที่ไม่ตรงต่อสถานการณ์
เช่น ศัพท์ทางการทหาร, ยุทธวิธี, รูปประโยค หรือสำนวนที่ควรจะเป็น เป็นต้น
(ขอชื่นชมทีมงานเป็นอย่างสูง และหวังว่า คอนเมนต์นี้ จะเป็นประโยชน์ต่อทีมงานในการพัฒนาต่อไป)

- หากจะเล่นเกมนี้: ย้ำว่า ตาม System Requirements จริงๆ
(ประสบการณ์ส่วนตัว คือ เปิดแล้ว เนื้อเรื่องค้าง จอดำ เกมดับ ครบเลย)



แต่ถ้าใครชืนชอบ Heavy Bolter Skin + Ultramarine Skin
บวกเงินอีก 300 บาท ก็จะได้ Ultra Edition มาครอง

หากใครที่กำลังรอ หรือตัดสินใจกับเกมนี้

and now this the sequel from 1st space marine, my god how its so much better the visual, the story, everything is just perfect in my POV, as for the pvp i barely touch it i dont really care much about pvp, as for the other mode (the operation / co-op mode) its really challenging theres so much class you pick, which one is suit for you is up to u, you want to be support you got it, you want to be the all out offensive you got it, you want to be sniper picking enemy from far you got it.

though the dev could improve more on it, which i heard thats what they're doing, thats great!.

its 9/10 for me, best goty. as Asmongold said ""space marine 2 is a reminder what we lost"" a nostalgic good story driven games that are fun like back in the day Halo series, god of war, and DMC.",2024/9/19,en
ICShields,0,24.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023836949/,"Overall i have to say that in general it is a good game. It does a lot of things right. At least the launch wasn't scuffed like darktide's launch was. Plus i don't have to fiddle around with graphic settings to make it not run like the biggest laggy ♥♥♥♥♥ of a game i have ever seen.

Yet....there just no real substance to the game. I'm completely honest here, for a game like this. I am totally fine with the story being short (roughly 12 hours on veteran) all good.

BUT the big thing why i can't recommend is that the PvE is just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lackluster. 6 missions ? That's just not enough at this point. To really have a good rotation you need at least 10 missions. Then the fact that some classes are heavily limited to weapons.

The idea of their difficulty scaling is literally making enemies bullet sponges.
Thats just not good enough and only ruins the game when even the useful weapons aren't enough to pose a real threat to the enemy.

I don't play PvP so i can not comment on how this aspect is.

They also have a road map that should feature a horde mode. I mean....a horde of bullet sponges ? nah bruh. Its a good idea but with the current way the difficulty scales its just not something i could see people enjoying a lot. I'd rather have 4 new operations to freshen up things plus a rework of how difficulty scales.
Mix in more majoris or make random hordes appear at some point. But don't give them more health.

Also PLEASE for the love of anything that is holy and under the protection of the emperor, the one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing he doesn't protect is your server connectivity. I can not tell how many times i don't even get matchmaking going and then the game tellse me that the connection is not working and if i wanna play offline. Like WHAT ?! Holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sigmar. I am waiting longer for people to join my lobby than it takes me to finish 3 operations. How is that even possible ?

Yes we've seen all of this in other games and maybe that is not the route the devs wanna go. I am just saying that there is not enough content to make this worth while",2024/9/18,en

Ai_shuang,1,32.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198286835015/,"在已经2024年的今天，战锤这一IP也快和整电子游戏历史一样度过了几十年，在这个过程中也曾诞生了不少战锤系列的各类型游戏，比如战锤全面战争、末日鼠疫、暗潮等等。而本次的星际战士2作为标准游戏工业的水平展现，也为战锤系列游戏立下了又一个重大工具点。不得不说战锤这一IP是非常幸运的，先不论暗潮与星际战士2后续运营如何，单说游戏总体质量确实很高，隔壁的士官长与战争机器可谓是馋哭了。



本次星际战士2分为3个模式，战役模式玩家扮演泰图斯小队在8日战争中结束敌人的阴谋，而行动模式玩家可以自定义星际战士扮演战役中与泰图斯小队互相接应的小队执行同一战役的不同任务，该模式有职业与武器rpg系统，也承担了游戏中刷刷刷的要素。最后一个是没有数值成长的PVP模式，内置等级仅用来解锁武器使用权限。



本作的整体设计其实非常的传统，3个模式完全分开，各司其职，战役专注与给玩家带来一段近些年十分少见的猛男冒险故事，序章讲述主角从哪里来又准备做什么，结果遭遇意外而进入本篇的故事中去，成为一个小队长，有两位不那么听话的队友，在大事件中先执行各种较小的任务徐徐展开这个世界，有着十分传统的关卡设计，同时每一关都塞入一些当今游戏愈加少见的大场景与多演出脚本。在这个过程中慢慢展示主角与队友的羁绊，最终面对大危机展开决战。这也是老ass游戏的一个特点，就算在游玩前流程被剧透，但当自己真正游玩，看到，听到这些事、这些人物、这些大规模场景在面前发生时仍会感到兴奋与颤栗。



同时在战役中有很多战锤这个系列的经典演绎，熟悉该ip的玩家恐怕还没开始就已经能想象到故事的发展方向，但对于未曾接触过战锤的路人而言该作的剧情也是非常简单直接，前因后果交代的十分清除，没有什么需要额外买小说、漫画才能看懂剧情的谜语人设计，没有太大的理解成本，对外人可谓是十分友好。而对于锤佬而言游戏处处都是细节，比如流程中一段星界军众人抬不起来的大门被星际战士一人抬起，就会让锤佬会心一笑，且这段演出在其他玩家也能简单看出主角的强大。



还有各种经典战锤环节，如旗插兄贵山更有经典剧情：基因原体中十三阿哥基里曼麾下极限军团战团长、胶瘾上头的ICU战神、那个蓝人、全银河最难杀的男人、抱着太空死灵家的电线杆做武器、干爆泰伦巢主、一拳打死战神化身、两拳打爆安哥拉斯狗肉、两颗心脏成为混沌打卡圣地的超级猛男——卡尔加！（和他的担架小队）堂堂登场！堂堂单挑！




游戏本身的打击感与操控感也非常顶级，让玩家真正觉得我们所操控的是个3米高的超级兄贵，无论是因为庞大盔甲导致的走路姿势还是各种近战武器打在泰伦虫族身上都能让玩家感受我们这三十万匹马力的拳头究竟有多强大。
游戏本身的战斗系统也非常独特，吸取了只狼等游戏的优点融入进本作，当然若是你用键鼠游玩一定要将除了wasd外的所有按键都改一遍。在战役中我们拥有两把爆弹枪与一把近战武器，将敌人血量削减到一定程度后敌人会变红进入可处决状态，我们可以隔着老远就按住处决键让我们的角色在无敌状态一个箭步冲上去进行畅快淋漓的处决动画，而且有一点很不错的设定是处决前会取消一切动作后摇。同时游戏中还有个弹刀机制，敌人攻击分红色和蓝色两种，当被攻击时会先看到一个蓝色光效，此时无论玩家处于什么状态，按下弹反键就会直接弹反成功，中间的判断帧给的相对充裕，除了少数连段攻击需要弹两次外，此时我们可以直接开枪进入枪决状态，不过既然枪决是远程处决，那把无敌效果删了也十分合理。同时游戏中没提的一点是红色攻击也可以完美闪避后接枪决，且这游戏所有小怪攻击都可以弹，因此理论上，注意是理论上我们只用近战可以达到这是我的回合，这还是我的回合的战斗。



然后其他设计决定了这套机制并不能完美运行下去，比如泰伦虫族一个虫子的造价在虫巢看来还不如一颗子弹昂贵，直接根你玩虫潮作战不好吗，因此在战役中星际战士面对四周包围的敌人与只能用枪解决的远程兵时也之后在部分间隙用用弹刀。且弹刀虽容易，但也要考虑失败的风险，游戏中玩家的受击受击硬直过大，且经常面对被包围的情况，无论何种难度，有时候一个操作失误就会被连死，这也导致玩家在不熟练的情况下也很少主动去使用这项能力。



不过游戏本身是非常鼓励战斗，我们星际战士首先是拥有一层护盾，无论什么处决都可直接回复护盾。盾碎后掉血后先是虚血，和血缘类似攻击可直接回复虚血，且本作的虚血是一比一保留且时间不短，有时在怪堆里拿大锤打小怪就是你打多少我吸回来多少。



然而本作在关卡流程中塞入了大量远程怪，让上述的很多战法丧失了使用空间，且这游戏的远程怪攻击频率与精准度不低。不过有个设定是击杀远程精英，旁边的小怪会自己死亡，然而这个教程藏在pve角色挑战中，可能制作组在这时默认大伙都是锤佬，知道虫族是蜂巢意识，死一个大工具点周围的小弟都会死亡。



以及制作组用脚填数值，目前部分武器平衡很差，热熔器灭一切，而该世界观中的能量武器在本作却效果一般。最高难度的怪物巨肉，ai和僵尸事件大战时的ai一样不干任何事情，只是有80%的减伤不怎么会死。不过战役总体而言还是建议大伙玩低难度，这样倒也符合原设定中星际战士的强度，毕竟战役除了成就之外并不会有其他任何奖励。若真想挑战高难度还是去pve模式中，毕竟pve后续想升级还必须打高难度，不要像我一样开局直接打最高难度的战役去坐牢，在这个过程中也无瑕欣赏战斗时的脚本演出。



关卡设计方面制作组还是僵尸世界大战做多了，很多关卡有非常强烈的既视感，总体称不上多好，中规中矩的水平。但部分关卡设计就有点粪，比如中间有一关需要手持彭喷火器在鼠堆里防守，在巨多远程怪的情况下需要时不时拿喷火器烧地面以放置机制杀，而如果你是带着两名ai队友打这关更是痛苦，ai什么都不干，输出和总机制只能全交给玩家自己。




本作的渲染风格很独特，不完全拟真，尤其是星际战士的盔甲，更像是使用各种阴影喷涂和做旧的战旗棋子，如果真让锤佬来玩估计单看各个皮肤都能看个好半天。且在pve和pvp中玩家还可自定义盔甲，这时也会发现游戏内战团颜色和现实中旗子油漆颜色名字一致。可能这也是一种商业策略吧，但总体而言不算坏。



不过这里也要引出本作在肝度方面的一些问题，目前首发版本战役和pve各6关，每关长度在一小时左右，而自定义盔甲的很多颜色都需要花费游戏内代币购买，而这个代币需求量十分庞大，目前区区6关的内容量真的很难撑得起玩家长时间的刷刷刷，且pve中每个职业的后续盔甲样式都需要胜利多少局才可解锁，总的算下来如果想全解锁至少需要玩家打204次pve，这真的有点夸张，明明最简单的把各职业的盔甲解锁变成通用就能减少一大半内容量，可惜制作组没有这样选择。



本作的PVP是较为传统的，也不作为制作组重点，很多功能就没想着去做，比如总战绩什么的，而pvp思路的话基本是必须抱团，星际战士的血量非常少，近战攻击还可直接穿盾，总体而言深度不高，不过我比较担心的是我在第一天打PVP的时候就遇到外挂，想举报却发现游戏内根本没有提供举报方式，遇到这种情况只能选择退出，不过退出倒也没有任何惩罚就是了。只能说制作组为了这个PVP而特意添加的小蓝熊并无太大用处，等一切尘埃落定后PVP除了大伙约着一起，不然应该是不太会有人玩。



不过值得一提的是经历过暗潮后我起初对本作的音乐抱有较高期待，但实际打通整个游戏后你问我星际战士2的音乐，我发现我完全想不起来这游戏的音乐是什么样子，不过相对的游戏的音效部分做的非常出色，爆弹枪这种大口径的初膛破空声、枪械内部机构的撞击声。还有个很细节的地方是在设置中玩家可以选择是否带头盔，而这也会直接影响角色对话音效。



总体而言本作是游戏工业下一个非常标准化的产物，有正常偏下的关卡设计，较为独特的战斗系统，也有战斗设计经验不足导致远程小怪强度略高。同时投入了较为充足的资源，且制作组内应该也有真正的锤佬提供想法，将这些资源也真正花在刀刃上，每关都塞上一些高质量CG；知道自己关卡做不好，那就狂堆演出；知道自己体量做不太大，那就在7小时的战役时间内将相关设计密集堆放；知道锤佬想看什么，那就着力在这方面；也知道考虑其他普通玩家的体验，就将整个故事以非常清晰的姿态展现在玩家眼中。这就在当今的欧美游戏业界就显的非常难能可贵了。",2024/9/8,zh-cn

Been playing for 2 weeks and was hoping the new patch would fix this issue. If you que with a 2nd person you will never find a 3rd person. Its a known issue all over forums yet they just released a new patch and didn't even try fixing it. If you solo Q you might find a 2nd player, and then end up with a bot. If you play with ur friend and u have a bot as 3rd player, its going to be tough on the higher difficulties. Game doesn't have much end game content, just 4 levels and 6 separate operation missions. End game content is lacking, campaign is short, campaign you don't even get to level up or use different loadouts. The loadouts are only available in a separate mode. Gets repetitive with no real differences. But not even being able to play with battle brothers or constantly glithcing and having to play with useless bots. Whats the point of this ""brotherhood"" game when all my brothers are bots? Don't get how SABER has not even attempted to fix this issue last patch OR is aware of it!

NOV 20/2024 They fixed matchmaking not as buggy. Game is a bit easy, on the hardest level difficulty LETHAL mode, you get some skins that show you beat all of it as bragging rights or honor. For how massive the lore is for Warhammer and how epic the brotherhood is. Feels like the reward is lackluster, needs something more cooler for the achievement. Glowing helmet, or a diff color, or something, its just a scratched helmet that u can barely even see unless you are right beside a brother... Lol. Expected something much more EPIC.

Then came Patch 3.0 when the developer intentionally removed any online play for Linux users; this after the game released in a wonderful state under Proton. I've patiently waited a week, and yet not a single official word from either Saber or Focus.

I've never had a game completely pull the rug out from underneath me like this before -- I'm so happy to buy full-price games so I can support developers that release games that work well in SteamDeck/Linux (especially if that's a specific goal of theirs, Larian being a good example), but what a mistake this was.

Ich bin selber kein großer Kenner des Universums, jedoch mag ich das Warhammer Franchise trotzdem, auch Warhammer Fantasy. Man muss jedoch kein Kenner sein, um das Spiel zu mögen.

Grafisch ist es einfach bombastisch. Alles wirkt over the top, wie man es von Warhammer erwarten würde.
Trotz das ich ""nur"" eine 3080 mit einem ryzen 9 5900x habe, läuft das Spiel die meiste Zeit butterweich und ist sehr gut optimiert. Wer immer stabile FPS haben will, braucht hier aber schon eine 40er Karte, wenn man alles auf max spielen will.
Einziges Manko für mich war das Ende der Kampagne. Es war unfassbar gut inszeniert. Jedoch hat das Spiel einem hier doch etwas zu oft die Kontrolle weggenommen und war dadurch gefühlt nur noch eine große Cutscene.

Хоть я и не питал никаких надежд по поводу SM2 после предрелизных демонстраций игрового процесса, меня всё же подкупили повсеместные пострелизные заверения, что это улучшение моей любимой первой части.
Что ж... Спасибо Saber:
-За медленный пиломеч.
-За убитые оглушающие удары, которые лишились и своей индивидуальной клавиши, и последующей stomp атаки при повторном применении, и, что самое приятное, которые теперь хуже сдерживают врагов. Элитный моб может просто упрыгать, или, как и маленький моб, воспользоваться атакой, которую не отменить заряженными атаками (так теперь кличут оглушающие удары из ориганала).
Ведь теперь боёвка строится вокруг такой игровой опухоли как парирования и контратакующие усиленные выстрелы: это и неуяз кадры, и оглушение толпы, и лучший способ совершить особое добивание, которое является единственным ПОСТОЯННЫМ способом сустейна получаемого урона. И всё это с мудацкими буферами в худшей традиции сосаликов.
-За миссии по обороне кала;
-За миссии по отгону кала огнемётом;
-За контрольные точки, на которых не подбираются подгруженные заново предметы;
-За два стрелковых слота вместо 4-ох;
-За стрельбу, интерфейсы и звуки, от которых хочется выпить соевого молока;
-За полную деградацию динамичного и impact'ного игрового процесса на прыжковом ранце (светлая голова, которая это придумала, достойна стать сервочерепом, ну серьёзно);
-За грусть, что вместо продолжения бодрой beat em up игры с расслабляющей стрельбой (где каждая пушка чувствовалась как надо), я получил тягомотину про избиение манекенов;
-За худший подарок другу на день рождения.",2024/9/20,ru

Non è necessario conoscere la lore fino in fondo per avere una totale immersione di quest'avventura: Infatti, il gioco ti trascina in un mondo oscuro e devastato, dove vestire i panni di un possente Space Marine è un'esperienza incredibilmente gratificante.

PRO:
Gameplay fluido e appagante: Combattere le orde è soddisfacente, con un mix bilanciato tra brutalità corpo a corpo e sparatorie adrenaliniche. L'uso delle armi e delle abilità è molto intuitivo e non richiede meccaniche impegnative.

Modalità cooperativa: Giocare con gli amici aggiunge una nota di maggiore divertimento e strategia in più, perfetto per affrontare le missioni più impegnative.

Supporto post-lancio promettente: Con una community già appassionata all'universo di Warhammer e/o players neofiti che vogliono conoscere questo mondo, il potenziale di miglioramento può essere molto alto per futuri aggiornamenti, DLC e contenuti aggiuntivi.
CONTRO:
Esplorazione limitata e poche mappe realmente immersive: Personalmente, penso che il gioco sia spesso lineare e non hai la possibilità di esplorare liberamente l'ambiente circostante per scoprire segreti, dettagli aggiuntivi sulla lore o, più semplicemente, oggetti unici da collezionare.

RODIPIT,1,63.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996876811/,"Я давний фанат Warhammer 40,000 и прошел немало видеоигр по франшизе. Разработкой шутера от третьего лица занималась небезызвестная Saber Interactive. Я погрузился в этот жестокий мир и нашёл в нём много увлекательного. А теперь обо всём поподробнее.

Тит — жив!
С релиза первой части прошли долгие тринадцать лет, однако разработчики не наплевали на историю Тита и снова вернули его во вселенную. После обвинения Инквизиции капитана понижают в звании до лейтенанта и отправляют на замаливание грехов перед Империумом Человечества в Караул Смерти. Успешное завершение очередной миссии, почти ценою собственной жизни, открывает герою путь обратно в Ультрамарины. После возвращения в десантный отряд Титу прокачивают тело — теперь он становится примарисом.
Разработчики неплохо поработали над сюжетом и предоставили полноценную связную и понятную историю о некогда любимом персонаже. Она соответствует лору вселенной и может заинтересовать стороннего игрока. Но не во всём — фанаты знают особенности происхождения отряда Ультрамаринов и точно обратят внимание на одну деталь в команде Тита. Зато наблюдать за происходящими событиями довольно увлекательно, особенно при любви ко вселенной. На протяжении кампании игрокам предстоит поучаствовать в нескольких опасных миссиях и сразиться с многочисленными силами враждебных фракций.
К сожалению, незнакомые с оригиналом геймеры не прочувствуют связь главного героя с оригинальной историей и могут потеряться в некоторых условностях мира. Несмотря на такую особенность, Space Marine 2 точно порадуют любителей динамичных перестрелок и кооперативных сражений. Именно в геймплее и заключается основная сила проекта.

«Ваха» — как она есть
Ранее я уже упоминал о прямом продолжении событий оригинала, однако стоит заметить и точное попадание в атмосферу всей вселенной. Брутальные жестокие бои, реки крови, жёсткая иерархия и следование лору — каждый фрагмент игры в деталях передаёт любимый многими фанатами мир. Следование первоисточнику заметно даже в модельках персонажей и огромном наборе вариантов исполнения брони героев.
Space Marine 2 точно позволит насладиться детализированными эффектами, фоновыми изображениями и окружением. Дизайн локаций вышел коридорным и понятным для изучения — потеряться где-то не получится, правильное направление подскажет маркер или выбегающая на Тита толпа врагов.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 наполнен эпиком, красочными и бесконечными перестрелками, брутальным экшеном, реками крови и наполненной событиями кампанией. Этого оказывается вполне достаточно, чтобы погрузить игрока в сеттинг и позволить ему насладиться атмосферой жестокости и несправедливости мира.

Плюсы:

-Детализированный мир с реалистичной атмосферой;
-Динамичные перестрелки с толпами противников;
-Красочные эффекты и анимации;
-Брутальный и кровавый экшен в духе Warhammer 40,000.

Минусы:

-Небольшое количество «эндгейм» контента;
-Маловато базовых умений.

Настоятельно рекомендую как фанатам WH40K, так и новичкам которые хотят познакомиться с этой прекрасной франшизой!",2024/11/28,ru

And while the Operations PvE mode that accompanies it doesn’t currently offer enough to keep me coming back, the deep customization options for your Space Marine do look promising if it’s supported in post-launch updates as planned.

Сюжет:

Простенький, но в целом приятный и отторжения не вызывает.

Геймплей:

В общем и целом очень приятно играть. Геймплей моё почтение, взяли формулу первой части и довели до ума. Заметил, что многие называют болтерное оружие однотипным, в каком-то смысле это так и есть, но все же разница между ними довольно большая. Стрелять и резать врагов сплошное удовольствие, чего стоят казни.

PVP:

Мне как игроку в пвп стало скучновато довольно быстро из-за однообразных и отзеркаленных карт, хотя игра себя не позиционирует как соревновательная. Хотелось бы добавить какие-то события или разрушаемость, поскольку условия во время игры никак не меняются, месилово 6 на 6 быстро надоедает.

Вдобавок очень грустно, что не добавили кастомизацию ХСМ. В декабре выйдут темные ангелы, буду считать, что кастом для хаоса все же завезли)

PVE:

Качественные миссии не отстающие от сюжета в плане уровня исполнения. В них не скучно играть и даже перепроходить. Я прокачал почти все классы и все оружие, а это говорит о многом.

2.内容不够就狂堆难度，n4和n5是断崖式的差距，n4随便杀，n5没有盾和榴弹基本打不了，有了也要配合的非常好才行
3.修修你的报错闪退和服务器掉线的问题吧，一晚上不遇到三次我都觉得是帝皇祝福我了
4.星际战士最经典的就是爆弹枪和链锯剑，好家伙爆弹枪打一个弹夹不如榴弹一发，近战砍三刀砍不死一个小刀虫，大锤更是离谱，刚起飞没落下就能坠机，恍惚间我好像看见牢大了
5.狙击弹药不够，而且清不了虫潮也速清不了精英，唯一的作用就是杀脑虫，现在还要和队友一起站在怪堆里才能回甲，不如直接把牢狙删了算了，设计师你真的玩游戏吗？
6.打n5甲本来就跟纸糊的一样，还要站在一起才能回甲，那么问题来了，远程怪个个都像文迪卡刺客一样，远程清不过来的时候近战职业怎么去清理？去砍半天砍不死还要脱离队友冒着不能回甲风险在怪堆洗澡，近战伤害不如远程，那不如把近战删了。
7.本来就是个半成品，内容严重不足，价格还卖的这么贵，bug多，服务器差，掉线闪退严重，职业和枪械平衡也是一坨稀烂，爆弹和近战伤害这么弱也不加强一下，这是pve不是pvp！我们要的是每个职业每个枪械武器都玩的爽！

Titanic bump,1,64.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031770795/,"Всем читающим пламенный привет)
Если кратко, то я рекомендую эту игру, она мне понравилась и о потраченных деньгах не жалею.
Дисклеймер. В обзоре может прослеживаться дилетантское отношение к вселенной, простые ошибки и т.д. Это вызвано тем, что я просто интересуюсь вселенной и платежеспособен, чтобы купить эту игру и кайфовать. Желания детально погружаться во вселенную нет, хоть она и крутая.
А дальше пойдем более детально.
Почему-то именно на эту игру захотелось оставить отзыв, так как игра не совсем однозначная.
Начнем с некоторого контекста. Я не являюсь ярым фанатом вахи, с некоторыми деталями вселенной я знаком, но и те из видосов на youtube:) Книг не читал, из игр немного играл в Boltgun и Inquisitor - Martyr.
Но вселенная мне симпатична. Так же я достаточно много играл в прошлое творение Saber, WWZ( к которой будут отсылки в этом обзоре).
Начнем с краткого обзора на игру, основываясь на моём субъективном восприятии:
Плюсы:
- Игра красивая, очень приятный визуальный дизайн. Дизайн локаций выполнен просто потрясно. Города ульи, прям вызывают восхищение, ибо всё просто огромное.
- Атмосфера передана прекрасно. Мрачное 40-е тысячелетие, во вселенной где война длится вечно, передано просто прекрасно.
- Уважение и любовь ко вселенной. Чувствуется что разработчики действительно с уважением относятся к данной вселенной. Потому что даже под самым жестким контролем со стороны Games WorkShop можно сделать низкокачественный продукт, благо таких игр по вархаммеру, которые находятся на дне стима очень много. В качестве примера: По сюжету, один из второстепенных боевых братьев получает тяжелое ранение и на протяжении всего сюжета, где-то на заднем фоне хаба его подготавливают к тому, чтобы стать дредноутом.
-Геймплей против тиранидов. Мне безумно нравится сражаться с данными противниками. В меру сложные, их много и получаешь удовольствие от крутости своего персонажа. Чувствуется что мы идеально оружие в руках Императора человечества.
-Очень понравилась фишка с разделение кампании и pve миссий. С точки зрения повествования, они идут параллельно.
-Pve миссии, они же операции. По факту, покупал игру только из-за этого режима. Так как мне нравится WWZ, то тут я ожидал примерно следующего:
Классы с уникальными способностями и вооружением, толпы врагов и кооп. Всё это я получил и в целом доволен. Ну и прокачка, нравится мне этот аспект, что ты играешь ради чего-то.
Минусы:
-Сетевое состояние игры. Я не знаю, что именно происходит, но бывает что выкидывает из игры, не подключает к лобби. Не так часто происходит, но когда происходит дико бесит. Такая проблема была и в wwz, так что к этой проблеме я чуть-чуть привык.
-Геймплей против еретиков.Это не прям уж минус, просто заметил что из всех операций, я играю только в те, где противниками являются тираниды. Геймплей против еретиков становится более тактическим, поэтому приходится переключаться из режима берсерка.
-Небольшой минус, это баланс. Видимо ядром игры были реализованы операции. Ибо там баланс противников и классов выполнен просто отлично. Что же касается кампании, то чувствуется, что она сделана с использованием такого же подхода, только классов у вас нет и оружие не прокачивается, что иногда вызывает вопросы.
-Закрытость PVE миссий, пока не пройдете сюжет. Ну это минус лично для меня, так как покупал игру ради операций с друзьями, тут же пришлось проходить сюжет. Такое небольшое ограничение немного разочаровало.
Подводя краткое резюме по этой игре:
Это великолепная игра по вселенной Warhammer. наверное лучшая в которую я играл. И просто хорошая игра со своими нюансами. Не стоит её покупать думая, что она прям как helldivers 2, это совершенно разные игры, которые дарят совершенно разные эмоции. Если вам нравятся игры с прогрессией, отличным визуальным стилем и минимальным порогом вхождения, то эта игра для вас. Если у вас по различным причинам не так много времени на игры, а вы их любите, то эта игра безусловно подарит вам отличные эмоции. Особенно если играть в неё 1-2 часа в день. Просто чтобы расслабиться. Захотите получить вызов, просто можете отправиться на более высокие уровни сложности. Однозначно рекомендую эту игру к покупке. На цену специально не обращаю внимания, потому что всё нынче дорого и пока вы будете думать, стоит ли эта игра своих денег, вы просто не получите нужное удовольствие. Так что постарайтесь сразу забыть о том, сколько потратили на неё.",2024/10/18,ru

However, in terms of gameplay, things are sadly not looking so good. At first, the combat feels crunchy and fast, almost like a third-person Doom, but as time goes on, the downsides become more pronounced than the positives. After only a couple of hours, you realize how restrictive the level and mission design is. Additionally, the encounters start to feel superficial due to the lackluster weapon design. Almost every encounter can be easily completed with any of the weapons, which lack identity; as a result, you, as the player, don’t feel in control of the combat—you just go with the flow, shooting mindlessly with a couple of melee combos and finishers here and there.

The story is mindbogglingly simple, but the performances are strong, so the game doesn’t feel entirely lifeless in that regard. It’s also surprisingly a direct sequel, both in terms of story and spirit. I’m pleased that a change in development studio didn’t result in a soft reboot.

All in all, Space Marine 2 is a marvelous technical and artistic achievement; however, it fails to deliver as a compelling video game. I have only played the single-player campaign, so everything I say is directed at that aspect.",2024/10/17,en

1. Я стал верить в Бога-Императора;
2. Кампания добротная, простенькая и нехитрая, но в конце пафос так начинает е*ашить изо всех дыр, что невольно начинаешь читать литании и катехизисы ненависти;
3. Операции, например, дичайший режим, как никакой другой строящийся на взаимодействии с боевыми братьями. И оружие в операциях чувствуется куда лучше, чем в кампании: а точнее, оно жестко е*ёт. Орды врагов, пафосная музычка, классы десантников - сплошной трэш, угар и содомия в хорошем смысле;
4. Можно часами сидеть и перекрашивать свой суповой набор, благо, что раскрасок орденов туева хуча;
5. Игра про здоровых мужиков в форме.

Минусы

SinpaiKuronan,0,53.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116989715/,"I won't deny that Space Marine 2 has some awesome moments (namely, any time you perform an Execution) but it's developers make a lot of decisions that chip away at my patience or otherwise confound me. I'll put a full list below, but some of the major ones are just a lack of cross-class weapon availability, extremely stingy use of I-Frames in a game with a lot of animation locks, and gating progression behind forced difficulty increases.

I also don't like Classes, but that's entirely my preference and I understand that's just how Monetization has decided Modern Gaming is going to develop.

1. Every class should be able to use every sidearm. Canonically, these are all Ultramarines, so you can't use the excuse 'well, different chapters learn different skills!' they are all in the same Chapter, and while I can generally forgive things like Heavies not getting Melee Weapons or Snipers locked to Knives, this is one thing I take major issue with.
2. No Automatic Sidearm at Launch? My trigger finger is getting enough exercise to lift a Bolter Pistol, and I am not a fan. Please add a sidearm that I can hold down the trigger and spray into Tyranid hordes properly.
3. Experience and Currency rewards are absolutely pitiful on Minimal and Moderate. I often won't even be able to afford a Color Pack after a mission on those difficulties, nevermind weapons. I can forgive putting my nose to the grindstone for class experience, but considering that progression is tied to unlocking and mastering weapons (which requires currency to buy every version of a weapon) this isn't okay.
4. Far more egregious is that Artifact and Relic Artifact Data is locked behind Substantial and Ruthless Difficulties respectively. Do you want to progress past Tier 2 Weapons? Well, your options are A) Tryhard, or B) Uninstall.
5. Speaking of Armory Data, it's not guaranteed for completing the mission. One has to be found in the mission (it is guaranteed to spawn, but ) and the other is from bosses that potentially spawn in the mission (but are not guaranteed, and also might coincide with the Horde Timer.)
6. Certain areas are basically guaranteed to Horde, which works heavily against it. Decapitation's Chapel is the best case of this: You can fight a Horde right outside the transition door, kill every Tyranid, enter, miss and then have to fight It's an extremely confined area which makes it even worse.
7. I-Frames are only built into Executions, like five frames of a successful Parry, and half of your Dodge. Most animations otherwise don't even have Hyperarmor, meaning you can get knocked out of your Stim, or you can start a Gunstrike instead of Parry and then get stunlocked and destroyed.
8. Ai cannot be assigned classes in Private Lobbies, nor can they be assigned specific weapons.
9. It's freaking 2024 and Helldivers 2, allows full remapping of all buttons on both Keyboard and Controller, what excuse does Focus have that I can't manually map my Melee to B/Circle button?

Focus recently released PAtch 4.0, and after an extreme amount of backlash, released 4.1 which removed nearly everything we hated from 4.0 (which was basically the whole thing, minus the introduction of Lethal) so the Developers CAN change the game if we demand it enough, and very quickly too.

ส่วนที่สองสำหรับแฟน 40K
นี่คือเกม Space Marine ที่พวกคุณต้องการ คุณจะได้เห็นความเท่ของกัปตันไททัสที่ได้กลับมาสู่อัลตร้ามารีนอีกครั้ง ได้เห็นว่ามารีนสู้กับพวกซีนอสและพวกทรยศโสโครกน่ารังเกียจยังไง (่ส่วนตัวนิดนึง555)
คุณยังจะได้เห็นความเท่ของตัวละครในเนื้อเรื่องหลาย ๆ ตัวที่แม้จะบทน้อยแต่โผล่มาทีก็สร้างอิมแพ็คในระดับนึงเลย แม้ว่าเนื้อเรื่องจะสั้นและอาจไม่จุใจสำหรับแฟน ๆ และบทตัวร้ายที่น้อยไปหน่อย แต่รวม ๆ แล้วเกมดี ซื้อเลย

Kinoso,1,76.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kinoso/,"Mis andanzas con la franquicia Warhammer datan de cuando aún era un preadolescente, y era un reverendo fanático del mundo de Fantasy. Recuerdo con cariño la primera vez que tuve internet en casa, en aquel PC de pantalla gorda color crema, y una de mis primeras búsquedas fue con el propósito de ver miniaturas nuevas de los Condes Vampiro.
Nunca entendí por qué 40K desbancó a Fantasy de forma tan brutal, y aunque acabé enamorado de esta nueva IP, a día de hoy Fantasy guarda un lugar especial en mi corazón.

Conocí Warhammer 40k más tarde que pronto, y no fue hasta el genial Rogue Trader que entendí de verdad su mundo. Cuando salió el Space Marine original, hace ya 10 años, aún no sabía la delirante profundidad y oscuridad de este universo.

Hoy, con más conocimiento sobre el lore que nunca, Space Marine 2 parece un doble regalo bajado del cielo; una carta de amor incondicional no solo para los viejos amantes de los muñequitos y las batallas en mesa, sino también de los que echamos de menos el tipo de videojuegos que se hacían en aquella época en la que lo importante era llegar a tu público objetivo y no llenarse los bolsillos con monetizaciones absurdas, cosméticos, refritos, crossovers putrefactos, todo el despliegue racial e invent-sexual de la gran ciudad americana promedio y demás basura postmodernista.

Space Marine nos ofrece una campaña que hace 15 años se consideraría otra más del montón de experiencias jugables de gran calidad, pero que hoy desgraciadamente es un soplo de aire fresco en una industria que cada vez más se canibaliza a si misma y constantemente muerde la mano que pone la comida en su mesa.
Adicionalmente nos ofrece 6 misiones extra de un grupo de marines paralelo en la que puedes customizar tu propio Astartes personal con los colores del capítulo, armas y armadura que desees, a la vez que ofrece infinita rejugabilidad subiendo cada una de las muy diferentes clases.

Por último y también importante, Space Marine 2 nos ofrece una experienca jugador contra jugador por el momento algo limitada, con un par de mapas y un par de modos, en la que un bando de Marines se enfrenta a otro de Marines del Caos por la supremacía galáctica. Aunque con visos a ser expandido en el futuro, este modo ofrece una muy satisfactoria jugabilidad bebiendo del shooter multijugador tradicional arcade tipo Call of Duty (baja al borde de la muerte, puntos, remontada, subida de experiencia de armas etc.) pero sin tener que ver a Niky Minaj ni a Messi embutidos en una servoarmadura.

Para poner la guinda a tan jugoso pastel, el mismísimo CEO de la compañía dejó un comentario en un vídeo de Asmongold apuntando su hartazgo de la desesperación de las corporaciones por introducir políticas moralistas en sus productos y abogó por un futuro en el que los videojuegos vuelvan a ser como antaño, diseñados para disfrutar y apelar a su audiencia y no para sermonearla.

Space Marine 2 se siente como un juego de hace 10 años- una afirmación que hace diez años tendría un matiz negativo pero que hoy, en pleno 2024, desgraciadamente es música para los oídos de todos aquellos que disfrutamos del medio tal y como se concibió.

Les points positifs :
+ Graphismes de très bonne qualité
+ Gameplay dynamique et agressif, offrant une vraie sensation de puissance, avec une bonne dose de gore
+ Excellente bande son

Les points négatifs :
- Peu de missions disponibles
- Certaines missions sont trop longues à mon goût : elles peuvent durer plus de 45 minutes à 1 heure. J’aurais préféré qu’elles soient divisées en deux missions plus courtes, car ce n’est pas pratique lorsque l'on n’a pas autant de temps devant soi.
- Bestiaire et arsenal un peu limités
- Trop d'interactions inutiles, comme celles à faire juste pour monter dans un ascenseur
- Les tirs des ennemis passent à travers certains objets
- La difficulté pourrait être mieux équilibrée : au lieu d'augmenter simplement les HP des ennemis, les transformant en véritables éponges à balles, il aurait été plus judicieux d'accroître leur nombre et leur variété. (c'est très mal pensé quand on fait face à plusieurs ennemis puissants, espacés, qui te tirent dessus à distance)

Edorian,0,14.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Edorian/,"Wide as a puddle, deep as the same puddle, with more padding than a Primaris Power Armor, and yet only amounting to an 8-10 hour campaign with maybe 4 hours of actual gameplay.

Please don't buy this at full price.

This would be quite a neat, if dragging, experience for 15 bucks. Asking for 60, or even 90 or 100 bucks for this is, frankly, insulting and shows how desperate people are for good a 40k experience. Sadly, this one ain't it.

For what's actually in the campaign:

You're jumping in the role of a grumpy, whinging, military door technician role playing as one of the Emperor's Chosen. During your fights with all of 8 types of enemies the game has on offer, next to its 3 bosses, your main job is pressing door opening buttons waiting for elevators.

Combat difficulty mostly revolves around avoiding getting pelted by ranged combat damage while trying to get into melee range, where the spectacular takedown animations and the mini-cutscene camera work really shines. Melee combat is covered by invulnerability and regeneration granted by these extended animations, i-frames during dodges, and a parry window wider than the greatest stained-glass displays in the Cathedrals of Terra.

Between combat encounters, you're walking down narrow, samey corridors with a ton of buttons and objective markers. There is always one way forward and one little side area, sometimes two, that contain an extra med pack, ammo pack and combat boosts. But don't fear, there will be an objective marker at the ready telling you the way forward, and which button to press for the next line of stiff dialog.

The campaign is a formulaic low engagement spectacle, dragging from vista to vista, where the characters in the cutscenes get to have a lot more fun and do way cooler things than what you're allowed to do in game.

Your “always ready for coop” group of 3 Marines, with our main character Primaries Marine, the flanked the jealous upstart that we'll grow to love over the course of the move and the placeholder personality and is also around for other to say lines at.

These are not the transhuman weapons of destruction, sworn to the will of the Emperor, and imbued with their 22 or 19 gene-seed organs respectively. This is Sergeant Jake McMuricaMan and his squabbling Band of Brothers, more devoted to human infighting about rank and questing orders than to carry forward the will of the Emperor in their Call of Duty. The plot might as well stem from one of these shooters.

The combat loop, when the game actually hands over controls to you, is split up 2 to 4 minute encounters in a contained arena. Each fight is followed up by 3–10 minutes of walking around, watching cutscenes, holding “forward” while more drooling placeholder dialog dribbles as you press some elevator button, and then finally arriving at the next small combat scene. But not before you're promoted to press the ATTENTION button to make sure you're not missing the highly scripted vista waiting for you. This Disneyland approach to level design can work out great for spectacle fighters, or depending on the difficulty you pick, walking simulators, but falls flat here as there is no overarching narrative or story being progressed. Just another power generator that needs turning on, another door that needs opening, another obstacle to walk around. All while the most impactful and coolest moments of the story happen off-screen.

The fact that the avoided having chest high walls and a cover bottom is the only concession made to modern game design on display. This small grace helped it feel at least a bit like 40k and not like the Gears of War cover shooter it felt like most of the time. You still get your fill of invisible walls blocking your every movement while the game is busy acting out its budget Hollywood movie that you get in the way with your desire to play it. Most of the areas could as well be wrapped up in yellow and black “STORYLINE — DO NOT CROSS” tape.

Now take your Medal of Honor and leave, Doorfighter of Ultramar.

---

Oh wait, we also shipped with Multiplayer! As all game executives of the 00'ths have taught us: Every shooter needs a multiplayer!

Multiplayer during the campaign seamlessly replaces one of your AI companions with a player. A neat system that, apart from some net code issues leading to desync and teleporting, works most of the time. Post campaign PvE content then is replaying 6 pieces sliced from campaign maps over and over again to gain XP to level up each of the 6 classes. All in all, a very simplified version of coop games like Warhammer 40k: Darktide, Deep Rock Galactic or Helldivers. While it feels thrown in to justify the horrendously overpriced experience, it does allow for a more combat focused experience with fewer story exposition and waiting segments, which is welcome.",2024/9/30,en

So long have i waited for it's arrival and it was everything i wanted and so much much more. Waiting on a day to day, week to week and even HOUR TO HOUR basis for the game to come out after first preordering the game by saving up some allowance, the campaign felt cathartic and divine.
Nothing short of phenomenal for me who has been engrossed in this universe for the last 14-15 years of my damn life.

Every tidbit of detail, voice acting, set pieces and generally the entire game itself is crafted with love and care from people who understand the setting to it's core and do not care about anything else.

Campaign: Well paced plot is easy to digest and has a solid ending. Final boss fight is awesome with lots cool moment throughout.
Operations PVE: Lots to grind for and feels fairly challenging for progression; was hoping their be more than 6 ops, but they have promised more for free with each season.
Eternal War PVP: This mode unfortunately feel like it got done last minute. The game modes there are fine, but there's only 3 maps with spawns being terribly setup and classes definitely having balancing issues. More maps and mode have been promised, but balancing will come with time.
Customisation: There is tons to unlock for each class with plenty of colours and emblems to make whatever marine you can think of. That's at least for the loyalist astrates. The traitor astrates however suffer from same thing as pvp part of the game, probably cause they were done last minute as well. The armour is locked to a set class with only colours and emblem being changeable.

Overall an upgrade to everything in the previous game beside the pvp aspect at the moment. With plenty more content coming down the pipeline I'm sure it can only improve.

A campanha é muito boa, embora um pouco curta, ja no modo online pve, a evolução das armas e das classes é bem rica e interessante, as aparências a ser desbloqueadas para as armaduras(única forma de progresso compartilhada entre pve e pvp) também parecem incriveis. O PVP é muito promissor, e estou me divertindo bastante nele, embora este necessite de um grande patch de balanceamentoe correções de maneira urgente, para poder alcançar todo o seu potêncial!

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 é uma verdadeira declaração de poder no mundo dos jogos de ação. Ele não apenas entrega uma experiência visual e sonora de tirar o fôlego, mas também redefine o que é um combate fluido, intenso e satisfatório. Cada batalha é uma dança feroz pela sobrevivência, cada cenário é um espetáculo grandioso de destruição e história, e a evolução do protagonista, Tenente Titus, reflete o crescimento do jogador diante de desafios cada vez mais formidáveis.

Este é um jogo que não se limita a ser apenas divertido – ele te prende, te empolga e te desafia a cada passo, com uma profundidade rara. Space Marine 2 não apenas honra a rica tradição do universo Warhammer, mas o expande com uma nova visão de guerra e glória. Se há algo que este jogo deixa claro, é que ser um Space Marine não é apenas jogar, é viver cada momento como uma força imparável no campo de batalha.",2024/9/21,pt

リカン,0,188.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198871762460/,"It's time to write a review. The main problems of this game:
1) Connection - constant connection errors in the ""eternal war"" mode, in particular problem 140, when you have to re-enter the game several times before all the stars align in the sky and you are allowed into the match, instead of being offered to go to the main menu once again . After which, by the way, nothing will change, you will still have to restart the game, and so on several times.
2) Chaos marine customization. We have a fairly rich customization for Loyalists and such a poor one for Chaos marine. Why are Chaos marine each class tied to a specific legion??? Why are there so few armor parts for them??? There are no my favorite ""thousand sons"" (Although they were in the main campaign of the game. Is it so difficult to integrate ready-made skins into pvp mode???). In general, Chaos marines are represented by a small number of legions, but where are the individual warbands, which are so numerous in the Warhammer 40k universe??? Here's another thing: Have you ever seen Berserker Khorne without a chain axe??? - and here you will see.
3) Class system. I will not say that some classes are completely unplayable, or become more or less playable only after opening some items. I have a completely different question here: Why does a game like ""Total Tournament"" or ""Quake Arena"" have a class system at all??? And the classes themselves do not inspire confidence: if the ""Night Lords"" still look in place, then Khorne berserkers in the form of a non-assault class are nonsense. Let me remind you that Saber ""presses so much on lore in its communications with the community"", for example, they have already answered the question: ""why is each legion of chaos tied to a specific class?"" - because it is according to the lore, and right then we see the berserker Khorne, who is clearly out of place. If you follow the class system, you will simply have to enter 100,500 thousand classes for each type of space marines, and then you will have to make 100,500 patches to balance this whole thing. I think it's easier to introduce a system of factions (legions), for example, you choose a legion to which specific types of space marines are available, and that's it. By the way, does anyone know why class experience in pvp mode??? (so I have classes that are developed to level 5, but how do they differ from the same class of level 1???)
4) I think it is no longer a secret for anyone that in the future it is a game service. Please remind me of the fate of most such ""new generation"" games))) I understand that all developers want to put their games on the ""monetization rails"" as soon as possible. I think at the stage of loot boxes with a small chance of dropping rare items, it will be possible to put the game on the ""Steam shelf"" and never come back here. I pre-ordered the max edition because I believed in this game, but if at some point I'm offered to buy skins and loot boxes in a AAA-game that's actually being sold instead of being offered for free, that would be a ""slap in the face"".

P.S I am giving a negative rating just to draw attention to the problems. The game is actually pretty good and has a lot of potential.",2024/9/20,en

I'm a simple man, vine para matar bichos y FUAA, es increíble cómo se disfruta en todo momento. Es muuuy divertido y frenético, y misión tras misión la epicidad asciende hasta llegar al peak que son las últimas horas. Una joya.

Aún me quedan los modos PVE y PVP (no le tengo ganas a este último, más por curiosidad), pero terminé completamente satisfecho con esa campaña.

UPDATE: Tras más de 50 hs, me metí de lleno en los modos Operaciones y Guerra Eterna. El PVE es una delicia, son siete misiones (a la fecha) que tienen muchísima rejugabilidad y a mi me divirtieron bastante en las dificultades más altas, y más aún si uno varía entre las clases para probar distintos estilos de juego. El PVP por otro lado está ok para jugar un par de partidas y ya, me quitaba las ganas el hecho de que tarda bastante en encontrar partidas y, cuando lo hace, casi siempre me manda a servidores de USA dándome alta latencia xd

No esperaba dedicarle tanto tiempo a este juego, pero ptm que me divertí muchísimo en especial en el modo PVE. Agradecido por este título.

Zhukovsky,1,17.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lalaleyhop/,"В целом невероятно хороший дизайн, внимание к деталям, небольшим приколдесам (КП-42, жму руку), отличное знание и воплощение в движение и звук бэка, простой и стройный сюжет.

Объективно геймплей полнейшее г о в н о, субъективно до ""хорошо"" оставалось совсем чуть-чуть, но работу забросили. Возникло ощущение, что чёткое видение было у всего, кроме геймплейной составляющей. Спасёт только полный оверхаул с привлечением нормальных геймплейных мастеров.

Некоторое оружие не отбалансировано по параметрам (силовой кулак), зачем-то отобрали возможность, особенно это было важно для девастаторов, уходить в уклонение при ""включённом"" прицеле, нельзя начать добивание находясь в режиме прицела, абсолютно не ясно зачем испортили штурмовика, кому нужны эти кулдауны и зависание на подумать с точкой падения в вечность. Абсолютно отвратительная милишная боёвка, вроде бы мы можем спарировать атаку, но это не даёт ничего, противник продолжает серию атак, от любой атаки проще всего увернуться, если это малый противник, которого можно отменить этим, панишеры из пистолета редки и особого смысла, кроме фреймов неуязвимости, не несут. Удары станящие противника не прерывают атаку, мы противника в лёгкий стаггер можем ввести только гранатой. Болтеры в первой части несли в себе импакт за счёт обилия рядовых противников, которые быстро и картинно умирали под всполохи детонаций масс-реактивных снарядов, здесь обычный хормогаунт или термогаунт могу станковать несколько попаданий, смерти теряются в толпе. 5 разновидностей обычных болтеров потеряли в импакте.

Хвалёная, патентованная технология орд имеет туже проблему в режиссёрском подходе, что и World War Z, у нас есть цельное событие, мы его часть и часть не основная, мы где-то сбоку болтаемся. Нам вроде бы и показывают гигантскую орду, генеральное сражение, танчики едут в бой, пехота выстраивается в порядки из диорам, Астра Милитарум поддерживает взвод 2ой роты Ультрадесанта, но от него нас просто уводит в карман более локальных событий, генеральное сражение обращается к игрокам только в в одной миссии спецопераций (ПВЕ миссий). Вроде бы мы даже окажемся в генеральном событии, но нас сразу же уводит в другой карман и мы с лицом жабки идём бить три калеки, вместо масштабного всекалова.

ПВЕ контента на 6 коротеньких миссий, почему-то нет выживалова отдельной миссией.
ПВП классический трилейн на маленькие команды, в другие режимы я даже не заходил.
Прокачка внезапно оказалось разделённой, что отличается от первой части и не способствует увлечению.

В общем и целом восторг и позитивные эмоции от сюжетки и ПВЕ я получил, денежка отбита на 11/10, но с таким геймплеем задержаться на дольше, чем я смог наиграть, не получится, немножко жаль.

TheGoldenWallcreeper,1,21.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037181089/,"У нас какой-то праздник вархаммера произошел с выходом этой игры. Лично мне в ней понравилось примерно всё:

- Очень красивая графика с хорошей оптимизацией, несмотря на все то, что происходит на экране. Ребята обещали огромное количество моделек, которые одновременно действуют на экране, дабы отобразить масштабность роя тиранидов - и у них это получилось.
Плюс разработчики с большим уважением к лору отрисовали красивые, масштабные локации в виде боевой баржи, имперских городов - примерно так ты их и представляешь, когда читаешь книги по вахе.
Первая игра, в которой мне захотелось воспользоваться фоторежимом (и я это сделал).
А уж то, как тут отрисованы доспехи космодесантников - это отдельный кайф. Видно, что это действительно доспехи сражающихся веками воинов, все в шрамах, выбоинах и других отметинах сложных боев. Это потрясно.

- Музыка. С ней все очень хорошо.

- Геймплей. Я рад, что выбрал не максимальную сложность, потому что даже на предпоследней жопу отрывало так, что некоторые части миссий приходилось отыгрывать по 5 раз, пока не подберешь ключик (либо просто не заресторишь хп). Хотя при этом финальный босс дался с первого трая.
В целом же - хороший шутер\слэшер, с понятной стрельбой, с хорошим импактом и разнообразием оружия, каждое из которых играется по-разному, что не может не радовать.

В общем, мою душу, преданную вархаммеру порадовали настолько, насколько это вообще возможно. От сюжета, от синематиков (отдельный и большой лайк за них) я словил оргазм несколько раз, особенно в конце. Последний раз такие эмоции были разве что в третьем метро.

Mais le reste... l'obligation de refaire la campagne alors qu'on l'a déjà faite en coop avec des collègues, je ne vois pas le principe. Pas d'historique des checkpoints des différentes parties (campagne) qu'on a pu faire.

Les bots Space Marine sont inutile à part revive avec 2000pts d'HP #GadrielPower. La campagne est linéaire bien dommage quand on voit ce que font d'autres studios Helldiver, Fallout... L'univers le permet, on dirait la recette de Space Marine 1 dont on a juste révisé la copie.

Sans compter le multi avec un matchmaking ""explosé"". Qui vous mets 3 niveaux 20 en face de 3 niveaux 9... Parce que oui c'était pas assez simple de faire en sorte que le rank s'applique à notre unité entière? Et que l'expérience du jeu ou plutôt l'histoire soit plus intéressante.

> Le scout au sniper : 3 balles pour tuer un bonhomme...

Franchement l'univers W40K a tellement plus de potentiel, vous utilisez à peine 10% et encore dans une logique de jeu d'il y a 10 ans (PVP, match, campagne). C'est triste à mon goût, pourquoi ne pas reprendre la recette de Helldiver en allant plus loin avec les races de W40k, envahissement, campagne planétaires voir galactiques etc... avec un choix de ""races"" de W40k qu'on pourrait incarner en fonction des souhaits de chacun.",2024/9/19,fr

Plusy:
+ Kampania, krótka ale treściwa i bardzo wciągająca. Ciekawie napisane postacie oraz wiele momentów, w które zapierały dech w piersiach.
+ Gunplay na bardzo duży plus. Czujemy każdy strzał jaki oddajemy, czujemy każde trafienie we wroga. Walka bronią białą jest również bardzo satysfakcjonująca. Finishery to bajeczka i nigdy się nie nudzą.
+ Oprawa audio-wizualna jest niesamowita. Ilość szczegółów na pancerzach, budynkach jest ogromna. Również wyostrzenie tego wszystkiego jest dopracowane do perfekcji.
+ Optymalizacja, grając na RTX 3070 i i9 12 gen, w żaden sposób nie doświadczyłem spadków FPSów. Dla mnie plus, ale nie wiem jak jest na sprzętach innych graczy.
+ Różnorodność broni. Arsenał naprawdę jest pokaźny i można sobie dopasować klasę jaka nas interesuje oraz broń. Znajdzie się tu coś dla każdego.
Minusy:
- Mało tych operacji PVE. Wiem, że są one bezpośrednio połączone z fabułą, ale no niestety, jest ich za mało.
- Gierka raczej jest do pogrania przez 1h, max 2h i potem trzeba zrobić przerwę, ponieważ jej powtarzalność jest bardzo wysoka. Nawet zmiana klasy na inną za bardzo nie pomaga. Natomiast w moim przypadku występuje duża chęć powrotu do grania po upływie tych 2h.
- Brak rozróżnienia historii zakonu, że tak to nazwijmy. Kumpel mi na to zwrócił uwagę i faktycznie zaczęło to trochę przeszkadzać. Kolorując Czarnego Templariusza albo Kosmicznego Wilka dostajemy nadal kwestie dialogowe Ultramarynarzy. Niestety jest to minus związany z tym, że operacje podchodzą pod fabułę. Mam nadzieję, że w przyszłych sezonach się to zmieni.

It has one of the best representations of the WH40K world and most importantly, the Space Marines and the Imperium of Man. The storyline is simple but executed perfectly. The characters are simple as well, stoic, stalwart Marines who will risk death for their fellow brothers and their mission, and that's ok.

The devs and Saber should be proud of SM2. It's a return to classic gaming and what makes gaming fun. There's no hidden agendas, narratives or overt political messages shoved down our throats. There's no overly complicated characters with a plethora of problems pouring their hearts out and whining incessantly about how the world is against them. It's a simple storyline about brotherhood, duty, loyalty and just your basic good vs. evil. So refreshing.

Buy it. It's worth it. The campaign is gloriously fun and gets your blood pumping with the amazing cinematics. The multiplayer is addictive and isn't overly grindy. You truly feel more powerful as you level up. I look forward to new missions, enemies and PvP modes.",2024/9/18,en

Starfy,1,5.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Starfycs/,"Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs, I am not here to praise or criticize this game. I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!

Here are the ingredients you will need!

Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.

Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.

Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.


1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.

2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.

4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.

5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.

6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.

7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.

8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.

9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.

10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.",2024/9/18,en

ALVARO-ELITE,1,27.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ALVARO-ELITE/,"Imagina que Gears Of War y World War Z hubieran tenido un hijo, un hijo al que le han inyectado esteroides en vena y lo han dotado de características como un combate brutal y visceral o un gunplay de los mejores que hemos tenido en lo que va de año.

Pues creo que esta es una de las descripciones que más se acerca a lo que es el concepto de Space Marine 2.

Un juego bastante redondo, con una buena campaña que se puede jugar en cooperativo (lo cual es un plus) aunque es verdad que la historia a partir de la mitad flojea un poco, no quiero entrar en spoilers pero el cambio de facción enemiga a mitad de juego parece que está un poco metido con calzador.

Un modo operaciones que está bastante bien y te anima bastante a jugarlo por que:

Primero: son misiones complementarias a las de la campaña, en los mismos entornos pero con otros lugares, soldados y objetivos. Como si de misiones secundarias se tratara pero orientadas al juego en equipo.

Segundo: tiene un sistema de clases y de progresión bastante adictivo, donde insta a jugar para desbloquear mejoras de personaje, mejoras de arma y aspectos de ambos, ya que se consiguen puntos para hacer progreso en las heráldicas o comprar nuevas habilidades de las clases con subidas de nivel.

Tercero: Son rejugables en cierta medida gracias a que tienen un poco de aleatoriedad como pasa en Warhammer 40.000 Darktide, con spawns random de oleadas, minibosses y cambios de objetos, RNG de items etc.

En cuanto al multijugador yo lo he encontrado bastante decepcionante por diversas razones.

La primera de todas es que son Arenas, que te da la sensación de jugar una mezcla rara entre un ""Gears"" multiplayer y un hero shooter por el tema de las habilidades de las clases.

Los mapas son pequeños, algo laberínticos y cerrados, a mí en lo personal me recuerdan mucho más a estar jugando a Quake/DooM arena que a otra cosa y la verdad es que es una formula que no me termina de convencer en un juego donde se juega en 3a persona y en el que los personajes creo que no son los idóneos para este tipo de mapas, creo que hubiera sido un acierto mucho más grande el hacerlo un multijugador más ""tradicional"" o con un concepto algo más a lo titanfall, con PvPvE que tenga marines como jugadores y soldados normales controlados por IA, al menos yo creo que hubiera sido una experiencia mucho más disfrutable.

Al menos me da la sensación de que el juego no tiene SBMM y es algo de agradecer, el ping es bastante parejo así que me da la sensación de que el juego busca por conexión (eso si, el sistema de emparejamiento, no balancea ni aunque sea solamente un poco, en serio, de 10 partidas no he podido ganar ni una, no es normal la cantidad de pedazo de mancos que te tocan en un equipo, que yo no soy ningún pro, pero consigo quedar con proporciones de 1.0-1.2 cuando tengo compañeros que tienen 0.1 es decir matar 1 y morir 8-9 veces)

En cuanto a nivel técnico es bastante sublime, tiene un motor gráfico propietario de Saber Interactive que ya hemos visto en World War Z que tiene un rendimiento y un desempeño como pocos, en serio, pocos motores pueden mover tanto enemigo con tanto lujo de detalle y viendose tan bien con un rendimiento tan fluido (y me muero de ganas de que portee a Vulkan como en WWZ que te da sin problemas para jugar en ultra a 180fps seguro)

El sistema de combate cuerpo a cuerpo es muy bueno, con los combos y las esquivas, contraataques etc. El de combate a distancia ya si es algo más normalito y no tiene nada destacable o mencionable frente a cualquier otro shooter, no innova en nada a diferencia del CaC.

Igualmente es un juego bastante redondo, ya digo que tiene algunas carencias en mi opinión, cosas que creo que le faltan (que imagino que se irán añadiendo con el tiempo) como algunas armas o facciones ya que la selección de armas es muy pobre y todas se sienten muy parecidas salvo 2 o 3 y JODER DONDE ESTÁN LAS ESCOPETAS, en serio, no se si es que nadie las ha echado en falta o que, pero por si os habéis dado cuenta no hay escopetas (y las hay en el elenco de armas del imperio) ya no hablo de que metan las porras o hachas de energía (que no estaría mal ya que el juego solo tiene 3 melés) pero es que me hace gracia que tienes como 7 rifles bólter que son el mismo arma con modos de fuego diferentes, 3 pistolas, 2 sniper y 2 armas de energía.... lo cual me parece un repertorio un poco pobre la verdad.

Otra cosa mala para mi es el multijugador, el de PVP, en serio, me parece lo peor que tiene el juego con diferencia, eso de que sean arenas pequeñas en vez de campos de batalla con multitudes de enemigos que es lo que representa al universo, me parece un FAIL de manual (en mi humilde opinión) por que si algo caracteriza al universo de WH40K es lo masivo de sus guerras y sus ejércitos, y para mi eso no se ve representado en un mapa canijo en el que se juega un 6vs6 o un 8vs8 etc.

Si te gustan los juegos de Hordas y la ambientación de WH40K adelante, es un muy buen juego, me atrevo a decir que una de las mejores entregas que hemos visto y vamos a ver este 2024, si os gusta el universo, otra joya que veo indispensable es WH40K Darktide donde vais a ver en 1a persona el lado de un soldado en vez del de un marine espacial, además de que se complementa muy bien con Space Marine 2 por que el juego se desarrolla en otros entornos y contra otras facciones como la plaga de Nurgle.

No soy muy de poner notas a un juego y menos de lanzamiento cuando tiene todo el contenido post-lanzamiento por delante pero le daría un 7,5-8/10 a Space Marine 2 y no más por que para mi falla bastante en el Multijugador PVP, de verdad que me parece el peor modo del juego y lo que más trabajo necesita para estar a la altura del resto del juego, es un modo bastante olvidable que no aporta nada al núcleo del juego. No innova en nada, y ni siquiera diría que es divertido, lo veo anticuado y fuera de esta época como concepto y como modo de juego, en cuanto al resto del título 10/10.",2024/9/16,es
Plage,1,54.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PlageGeist/,"Das Spiel ist gut!



- Die Grafik ist Stimmig bis sehr gut.
- Das Movement ist naja.. man kann es aber spielen (Tastenbelegung ist änderbar).
- Die Abwechslung kommt gerade zur rechten Zeit, damit man nicht gelangweilt wird.
- Mit guter Hardware läuft das Spiel sehr gut! (Mein RIG ist in meinem Profil)

Es kommt trotzdem ein ABER:

ABER ich bin kein Fan dieses Franchises und habe mir so gut wie nichts vorher angesehen, durchgelesen oder angehört und muss einfach, nachdem ich die Story mit einem Kollegen im Koop durchgespielt habe zum Schluss kommen:
Für jemanden der sich im Warhammer 40k Universum kaum bis gar nicht auskennt, bleibt am Ende bis auf ein gutes Action-Spiel gar nichts übrig.

Die Story wird man nicht verstehen, bei den Charakteren weiß man nicht wer wer ist oder welcher Rang jetzt was ist und so weiter und so weiter. Es bleibt einem einfach nur Ballern Ballern Ballern.

Und ich bin der festen Meinung, das ist auch jedes Mal der Genickbruch dieses eigentlich sehr interessanten Universums. Es reicht in meinen Augen einfach nicht aus, wenn man ab und zu mal Namen nennt, die einem vielleicht gar nichts sagen, dann für sich stehen und dann nicht weiter thematisiert werden.
Ich habe nach Teil 2 erst einmal den ersten Teil gespielt um zu gucken, ob ich einen WOW oder AHA Effekt bekomme, aber es ist in Teil 1 ja noch schlimmer mit den für mich nichts aussagenden Einwürfen von Namen.

Wenn ich eine Lore oder ein Universum erst ""Studieren"" muss um eine Story eines einzelnen Spiels zu verstehen, dann ist die verdammt noch mal nicht gut oder nicht gut rübergebracht.
Dann ist es einzig und alleine Fanservice und ob das für die breite Masse ausreicht, da habe ich meine Zweifel.

Trotzdem hatte und wer ich noch Spaß an diesem Spiel haben, so das eine Empfehlung trotz für mich nicht existierender Story noch gerade so gegeben ist.

From the Desk of Brother-Sergeant Gabriel, 3rd Company, Ultramarines Chapter

Mission Log: 15 Hours In, Campaign Complete

Hail, Brothers and Sisters of the Imperium,

The long-awaited call to arms has been answered. Space Marines 2 has descended upon us like a righteous storm, and after dedicating a solid 15 hours to its campaign and accessories, it is time to deliver our verdict.

Space Marines 2 has risen to meet the high expectations set by its predecessor and then some. The narrative, steeped in the grimdark lore of the 40K universe, unfolds with the gravitas expected of our sacred battlefields. Each mission is a crucible of intensity, keeping the Emperor’s light blazing as you face the myriad horrors that plague the galaxy. The campaign's storyline is robust, providing a compelling blend of heroism and tragedy that befits the grand saga of the Space Marines.

Combat is a symphony of visceral destruction, every engagement a testament to the might of the Adeptus Astartes. The bolter’s roar and the chain sword's hum are rendered with such fidelity that it feels as though you’re wielding these sacred relics yourself. The enemies are varied and formidable, challenging even the most seasoned warriors among us. The improved AI ensures that no battle is ever truly predictable, demanding tactical acumen and reflexes as sharp as a power sword.

Graphically, the game captures the dark majesty of the 40K universe with hauntingly beautiful environments and detailed character models. The ambiance is as oppressive as a Space Hulk, with every setting dripping in the atmosphere of an Imperium on the brink.

In terms of gameplay, the enhancements to combat mechanics and the new abilities granted to our esteemed warriors are noteworthy. The balance between raw power and strategic depth has been finely tuned, allowing us to crush the xenos and heretics with righteous fury.

However, the path of the righteous is not without its trials. There are moments when the mission design feels somewhat formulaic, and a few technical hiccups mar the otherwise flawless execution of this grand endeavor. Yet, these are but minor blemishes on an otherwise gleaming armor of excellence.

In conclusion, Space Marines 2 stands as a proud addition to the legacy of the Warhammer 40K series. It honors our tradition of battle while forging a new path with unwavering zeal. For those who walk the line of the Emperor’s light, this is a battle worth engaging in.

Shadow,0,40.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KamenRiderShadow/,"Very fun gameplay but not worth the $60 they are charging

The campaign takes about 6 to 7 hours to beat which is alright but you don't make any progress towards your classes or weapons in it which is REALLY dumb, the main thing people are going to be doing is trying to is level up their classes to be able unlock armor to make your character look good. The Operations mode is the only mode where you can grind for class levels but sadly there are only 6 missions which they expect you to grind over and over again but in 4 difficulties for 6 classes and 25 levels each. The PvP has it's own leveling system for some reason instead of just going off the operations levels and making it another source of leveling classes. Other than that it's an unbalanced pvp mode with only 3 modes and 3 maps that seems to be added as an after thought.

Could of been GOTY worthy cause of the PvE gameplay if it wasn't for the lack of content, poor performance, bugs, glitches and $60 price tag. I am glad I only paid $49 for this game but even then I feel as if it should have been $30 for the content it has right now.

Some things I like about this is no battlepass and no in game shop. Plus all the content they plan to add is going to be free, so eventually it will have enough content to warrant the $60 price tag.

Saber has transported me back to the first decade of the 2000s when video games were just art and pure entertainment. For sure this is not a perfect game, but it is certainly a great one. A solid campaign, cooperative mode and a multiplayer mode, which is simple, but very fun and entertaining, with a progression system and lots of rewards to unlock for free. Just like in the good ol' days.
How good it feels to be able to play a video game with no developer-generated fomo to encourage battle passes sales, with a clear roadmap before release, no microtransactions and no in-game store.
Space Marine 2 is visually amazing with stunning graphics, the combat system is smooth and action packed with a blood and gore feast. I'm playing it on a 3080 with no problems or bugs so far, but I think they can optimize the game even more for my fellow brothers who don't own a beefy GPU.

SMhero,1,149.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/smhero/,"""Courage and Honour!""

Space Marine II - это то за что все любили и любят компьютерные игры. Взяли брутальную вселенную, красиво ее воплотили на экране, насытили большим количеством ""вау моментов"", дали большие пушки, мечи и ""солдатиков"", сдобрили это кооперативом и мультиплеером, который имеет высокую реиграбельность и позволяет вместе с друзьями крушить черепа, а в конце написали сюжет. Что в итоге? Получили главный боевик начала осени, если не всего 2024 года.

При этом игра не пытается быть какой-то очень продуманной и не вываливает на игрока тонны информации по прокачке персонажа, механиках или тонкостях сюжета. Хотя это все есть, но подача настолько проста, что ее можно описать так: ""Вот меч, вот пушка. Знаешь, что с этим делать? Тогда вперед!"". Все гениальное просто.

Для тех же кто является еще и любителем (для меня в частности) вселенной Warhammer: 40.000 эта игра праздник посреди сентября. Такого тщательного воплощения всех деталей я не видел ни в одной игре по лецензии Games Workshop. Каждый пиксель в этой игре дышит и передает дух этого мрачного, гротекстного и захватывающего мира. Каждый космодесантник, каждый гвардеец, каждый тиранид и хаосит нарисованы с такой любовь, что невольно думаешь будто Saber Interactive всем офисом стали расписывать миниатюры для настолки и читать кодекс. Игра сделанa с огромным вниманием к деталям и любовью. Фотомод здесь это один из моих любимых режимов!

И что в итоге? Без каких-то либо откровений и изобретаний велосипеда мы получаем экшен, который выполняет свою цель на 200% - увлекает, развлекает и доставляет удовольствие. Это тот Warhammer: 40.000, который мы заслужили!

- Modo online ta com problema em achar partida por causa de servidor mas é divertido e as operações podem ser feitas com bots.

-O gameplay parece jogo de jogo antigo, no bom sentido, ela responde bem, facil de aprender e gostosa

-A customização excelente mas só é acessivel para os modos multiplayer e poderiam ter mais variações de armadura para cada classe.

Die Grafik ist beeindruckend, die Sounds sind stimmig, und die Waffen fühlen sich einfach großartig an. Ich habe die Kampagne auf der höchsten Schwierigkeit durchgespielt und aktuell zwei Charaktere – einen Verteidiger und einen Zerstörer – auf Level 25.

Die Kampagne ist hervorragend umgesetzt und fängt die düstere, epische Atmosphäre von Warhammer perfekt ein. Man fühlt sich wirklich wie ein Teil dieses riesigen Universums – einfach fantastisch. Auch die Koop-Missionen sind sehr gelungen und machen eine Menge Spaß, allerdings sind die Chaos-Missionen noch etwas unausgewogen.

Der PvP-Modus ist unterhaltsam, aber es gibt noch Luft nach oben. Mit nur drei Spielmodi und etwa fünf Maps ist das Angebot noch recht begrenzt. Zudem fehlt es den Chaos Marines an Anpassungsoptionen, was dem PvP etwas an Tiefe nimmt. Hier sehe ich die größte Schwäche des Spiels.

Das Spiel läuft außerdem extrem stabil. In meiner gesamten Spielzeit hatte ich nur einen einzigen Bug, aber keinen Absturz oder sonstige Probleme – es ist wirklich sehr gut optimiert.

An alle, die sich beschweren, dass es keine Pronomen, Frauen, LGBTQ+ oder andere Repräsentationen gibt: Im echten Leben könnt ihr all das gerne so ausleben, wie ihr wollt, aber in Warhammer geht es nur um Krieg! Lasst das Universum so, wie es seit den 90ern ist. Wenn es euch nicht passt, sucht euch bitte etwas anderes und lasst uns unser Warhammer so lieben, wie es ist: düster und gnadenlos. DARK and GRIM.

* O jogo está extremamente repetitivo, apenas 6 mapas para um farm gigantesco.

* A quantidade de bosses no jogo é mínima, e praticamente todos tem as mesmas skills.

* O jogo não tem um equilíbrio descente entre os mobs, seja minions ou mobs maiores. Os minions dão dano igual ou superior ao dos bichos maiores.

* O jogo não te da informação suficiente relacionado as evoluções das armas, deixando um limbo gigantesco nesse sentido.

* As informações sobre o poder de fogo das armas não parece estar certo. Você coloca elas no lvl máximo e quando usa elas em lvls mais baixos, preciso dar a mesma qtdade de tiros ainda para matar os mobs.

* O esquema de esquiva e bloqueio do jogo precisa ser aperfeiçoado.

* A skill do assaulto está uma avacalhação, as vezes funciona, as vezes não. O que acaba te levando a morte em algumas situações no jogo.

* Ou você joga com a arma melta, ou você não faz conteúdo endgame.

* Assault tem uma vantagem que diz: Ao realizar ataques carregados, vc n perde o controle ao sofrer golpes pesados e não pode ser empurrado. Mesmo com essa skill ativa, vc é empurrado e perde o controle TODA VEZ, inclusive por minions.

In around 9 hours of campaign the devs manage to pack so much story, so much lore, so much fun that it looks and feels like a XBOX 360 Game, by that i mean the best possible compliment i can think of, by that i mean that this game is simply tons of fun, the story is so simple yet so well done, its something in the likes of ""brothership, thrust, hardship, and overcoming the odds"", it doesn't need to be complex, it is a world of chaos, disgrace and corruption, and you, together with your brothers will punish the herectics responsible for this mess, easy and as i said, well done, this if by far one of the most fun and most enjoyable games i've played recently.

Постановка — моё почтение. Фанат во мне бьётся в экзальтации и захлёбывается от того, что додали недоданного лет за десять разом. Есть атмосфера и ощущение масштаба происходящего, что твои действия часть большой воинской операции Ордена, и это просто офигенно.

The main character, Titus, what can I say? He is just a chad; no other word can describe him. He rises to the challenge no matter what, with his unwavering faith in the Imperium of man and the Emperor.
The story was fantastic, well done, and filled with epic moments that make you goosebumps.

Giving this game a 9/10

Thrace,1,16.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007795709/,"Attention mesdames et messieurs, il s'agit d'un jeu COMPLET !
Hé oui vous ne rêvez pas, c'est arrivé. Terminé la campagne, fais toutes les ops en multi et tout ça sans un seul bug, sans un crash ou glitch en tout genre, déjà gros positif pour ça. Et dire que c'était la norme avant ... aujourd'hui c'est révolu mais Saber l'a fait donc on peut les en remercier (je vais essayer de donner le max de détails sans m'attarder ci-dessous mais pas évident car il propose beaucoup pour un jeu dès sa sortie)

Dans son ensemble, le jeu est assez dingue :
- graphisme : ça claque, rien à dire. Petit +, je vous invite à faire joujou avec le module ""photo"" dans le menu une fois en game, je vous promets une belle surprise. C'est simple j'ai un nouveau wallpaper 4K :)
- gameplay : on sent la puissance du/des personnages incarnés et des armes utilisées. Peu paraitre assez lent sur certaines actions (notamment corps à corps) pour quelques uns mais ça respecte assez bien le fait qu'on joue un soldat en hyper blindage faut pas l'oublier quand même ... et bien que lente, une attaque chargée de marteau ne vous décevra jamais, plaisir garantit. Et je ne vous parle pas des contres et finishers, mama!
- campagne : riche et variée, histoire travaillée et scénario qui en vaut la peine, certaines scènes sont assez épiques, immersives et vous prendront aux tripes. (exemple: quand on vous dira invasion, ça ne sera pas 3 petits et 1 moyen qui vous sauteront dessus ou dans le paysage mais bien une nuée en route pour vous démolir). +- 10h de jeu sans tryhard.
- autres actis : le PVP j'ai pas test mais pas trop mon truc de base donc on verra. Les ops en coop sont variées également, il y en a 8 pour l'instant et elles vous promettent un très beau challenge. Il y a 4 (5?) niveaux de difficultés et déjà le 2 c'est vraiment pas de la tarte ... donc de belles heures de gameplay en perspective.
- progression : point à lui tout seul tellement ce dernier a été développé. Je vous invite à aller voir des vidéos là dessus sur youtube si vous voulez plus de détails car c'est déjà bien poussé (darktide c'est du flan à côté) mais en gros, il y a pour l'instant 6 classes jouables, chacune ayant sa compétence active (1 par classe, un ""ulti"") et des passives bien distinctes, qui sont à monter avec de l'expérience acquise en combat. A côté de ça, il y a l'équipement (certains étant spécifiques par classe, je pense par exemple au bolter lourd réservé pour la classe lourde uniquement .. oui oui je sais j'ai fait la même tête) avec sa courbe de progression pour chaque arme. Bonus passif, versions améliorées, .. you name it ! + non négligeable, il est possible qu'une même arme soit utilisée par plusieurs classes, sa progression est partagée à travers toutes ces dernières. Vous ne devez donc pas la remonter de 0 en changeant de classes, malin !
- personnalisation : last but not least comme disent les anglais! Gros catalogue de personnalisation couleur avec toutes les pièces de votre armure modifiables individuellement. Et tout ça ? Juste avec de la monnaie in game, pas possible avec de l'argent réel. Un plaisir.

Donc:
Grand OUI pour le jeu, foncez et partagez la démocratie de l'Empereur ;) . Seul petit négatif potentiel, les missions pourraient devenir répétitives à la longue pour atteindre les niveaux les plus hauts, à voir ... moi pour l'instant je ne le ressens pas.

Bonus:
Quelle version choisir ?
J'ai pris l'ultra édition mais je ne pense pas que le cosmétique offert en vaille vraiment la peine.. par contre le season pass aucune idée de comment cela va se dérouler donc à vous de voir ... mais si le contenu futur est dans la lignée de ce qui est déjà proposé, ça ne sera pas une perte.",2024/9/12,fr

<c=FC00FF00>Kermit The Frog,0,113.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DaBaux/,"As a Warhammer fan, the art, the design, just everything pleasing to the eye

As a GAME, this game is overhyped and overpriced. Outdated gameplay that didn't innovate in any sense of the word. I'm disappointed that this was literally just sm1 with better graphics. The content is extremely lacking, 6 repetitive missions with repetitive gameplay to boot. It's better to buy on sale for those who don't wanna read everything.

- Story:
It's brief, generic, and forgettable. The plot is more generic slop comparable to a call of duty campaign so don't expect too much there. The story is effectively glaze central for the BLUEBERRIES then omg secret bad guy plot out of nowhere instead of Tyranids being the main focus, diverting from the more interesting developments that could've been. Wish there was more focus with the marines themselves instead of lol chaos again.

- Lack of various QoL options like FOV sliders.
Not enough graphics options to disable features like post processing effects or light sensitive features, Lack of support of various monitors, Motion blur literally doesn't go off when you set it to off, the list goes on. The game can be a disco show at times, giving me headache on top of only being able to see my character's GIANT ASS cheeks lawd haf murthy.

- Clunky movement and unresponsive actions at times
Dodge is horribly delayed, not many ways to cancel out of animations.
There's these weird moments where you stand still thinking you'd dodge and you may say to yourself ""what i dodged what the heck"" well I'm here to tell you you're not CRAZY. The dodge is hard coded to buffer sprint as an action on PC, resulting into delay actions because of the buffer option select between dodge and sprinting. Extremely ass cheeks.

- Clunky Melee and Ranged Combat.
Aimming feels stiff due to the options for sens being so limited. But for the most part the clunkiness comes from how underpowered the weapons are. There's about 4 usable guns i can think of in my head. The sound design is lacking for some weapons and don't pack the resounding WALLOP that Bolter has in other games. Then the crosshair bloom just makes weapons feels so off and boorish that's not even worth shooting half the time cause you can't hit the board side of a barn. Melee which I was hoping to be different enough to entice ultimately falls short dude to the lack animation cancels for dodge and more. You end up parrying everything as much as possible for it is the only way to cancel, downside being you're standing still to get peppered by bullets. I hope it changes.

- Overly reliant on ""QTEs"" or executions or deadshots
Now that know this may not seem like an issue at first but when you realize these are the only ways to regen armor during combat it becomes glaring. It's cool to see the first 20 times but after 3 hours you'll wish there were introduce more ways to engage with regen. Standing still doing a cool animation with a camera interrupts the flow of gameplay and adds to the clunkiness of the game. The lack of ways to regain armor is astounding. THEY REALLY want you to abuse executions and deadshots as much as possible cause of the iframes executions give you. I wish the game would encourage aggressively slashing my enemies instead of having to watch an animation play for 500th time.

- Overly reliant on off screen indicators
This is the same problem i had with god of war 2018 where the fov was so low that had to see my characters HUGE ASS BACK. Constantly taking backshots from tyranids because i have to look at the funny circle around my character and press the button. It's lazy to me and makes combat feel unfocused.

- Difficulties are badly designed
One sentence, increasing health and damage and nothing is bad difficult design.
Bullet Sponges put people to sleep stop this ♥♥♥♥. Really throws the balance out of whack.

- Content is lacking and the game is highly repetitive
I can't be bothered to play the same 6 missions over and over again that hardly vary enough to be noticable. There's not much to say because of the game not having content on release. The only way they tend to vary is ""place X amount of bombs"" objectives change the number of bomb. Again how is this game 60 bucks?

I really wanted to like this game but it's just an outdated action game to me.

I'm sleepy as ♥♥♥♥ when i made this review so i may have missed some points i wanted to make. But don't buy right now wait for sale.

EDIT 17/10/24: Yeah I'm done with this game.
This roadmap is actually horrible.
1 New mission when we only have 6 in the game is baffling. 1 new weapon is cool i guess.

But the biggest kicker of the whole thing is the obvious malice against modding. They essentially killed modding this update. The only thing keeping the game on life support for me. I enjoyed cosplaying the deathwatch, using various weapons with different classes in pve, AND FINALLY HAVING FOV IN THE GAME, it was a good time. Instead of saber embracing this part of the community, they've effectively killed it off for good this time. Don't let the shills tell you this game is a good faith game. It's not. It's more marine slop core. I'm sure the designers and most devs were very passionate about making the game, but some of the higher ups definitely didn't understand the game's fanbase.",2024/9/12,en

《战锤40k：星际战士2》作为2011年《Space Marine》的续作，作为可以单人或多人进行游玩的快节奏第三人称战斗，你将在其中扮演回归极限战士队列的副官德米特里安·泰图斯，通过史诗级的战斗再次击退你的敌人并揭露真相。
游戏有着四种可选难度，并且在开始游戏前也可以绑定官方账号，从而领取限定奖励，头盔等皮肤，游戏背景则是在四十一千年人类濒临灭绝时期，银河系的人类帝国面临了异种袭击，而故事也由此展开了，游戏支持中文以及中文配音，当然你也可以体验英文配音只要记得打开字幕。
音画初见
不知名的植物叶脉分明，钢铁铸就的设施被虫巢占据破坏，碎石与鲜血布满地面，前进的道路上也有着障碍互动，可以踢开挡路的土堆扛起巨石等等，虫群随着病毒发射数以万计向你涌来，盔甲厚重保护着人体，骷髅与翅膀，死亡与生存，当你行动起来，被护甲包裹能听到机械摩擦的质感，你孤身一人为了人类生存而战。
该游戏采用了3D的画面塑造，在人物建模以及环境表现上十分优秀，序章你将操控与飞船失联的杀戮小队队长在庞大异形虫族的袭击中感受星际战争的震撼场面，在恰到好处的BGM中感受爆炸与鲜血，了解教程上手的同时，感受其中的紧张与刺激，当然对话时的剧情信息更是充满了吸引力。
第三人称视角下可以使用键鼠或者手柄，这里个人使用的是键鼠操作，攻击和重击都是一个按键，差别是按下和按住，按下会进行一个三次攻击连招，三次之后会出现一个间隔，按住则可以对抗大群敌人且按住时间越长重击威力越大。
你受到伤害会消耗护甲，护甲会在一小段间隔后恢复，短期内失去生命值可以通过造成伤害来恢复，同时设计了招架和完美招架可以立即击杀小型敌人使大型敌人陷入僵直状态的防御机制，可以闪避无法招架攻击以及对倒下敌人施展终结技处决以及使用技能等战斗元素，增加战斗爽快感。
在拿到枪械之后可以利用鼠标中键是瞄准，左键射击，在近距离战斗中可以结合重击来标记敌人施加强袭击杀小型敌人甚至对大型敌人造成大量伤害，同时场景内也有着补充弹药以及拿到可投掷榴弹等可收集使用。
星际战士大战外星异种，当序章过去，你便可以开启你的在线模式，进行单人或者多人战役，通过编辑小队来邀请你的朋友组成一只三人小队，最有趣的是载入游戏时你能在飞船内部看到任务栏，这里不得不再提一句，游戏的过场CG以及配音都十分精彩，贴合剧情。
战斗开始会有一个可以选择武器的设施，你可以在这里挑选你想要利用的枪械和进展武器，比如爆失卡宾枪、战斗刀等等，战役中能够找到数据板来听取音频日志，你可以在武器厅更换你的配装，当然战役或者任务时会对一些武器有所限制。
游戏分为PVE和PVP模式，你可以通过行动进行任务战役的PVE模式，体验剧情的同时获取经验、点数以及可发现的武器数据等奖励，而永恒战争则是PVP模式，可以通过快速比赛加入小队随机开始PVP，基本就是占领、夺取以及歼灭等不同元素。这里建议主线完成之后在进行其他可能剧透的模式体验从而解锁更多技能和装扮。
作为快节奏第三人称动作游戏，你可以在游戏中进行单人和多人的在线作战，支持PVE和PVP模式，并且有六种不同特长的职业可以进行升级从而解锁新的技能以及装备，优秀的剧情CG和音画表现加上炫酷的特效塑造了精彩的视觉表现，而快节奏的战役任务也在多种武器和技能的结合下呈现了爽快的射击动作体验，趣味性和挑战性十足，推荐给感兴趣的朋友。",2024/9/12,zh-cn

- Some of the best graphics around
- Wonderful melee combat and good gun combat to
- Voice acting is done well
- Music and other audio is done good
- Decent story
- A great lean and very fun campaign with no filler
- Performance for me was good the whole game, never below 60fps w everything cranked
- No crashes during the whole campaign
- Addicting gameplay
- Atmosphere is great, with so many enemies around feels like a real war
- Fun Coop
- No BS in the game, just a good old fashioned kicking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ videogame
- Level design is awesome
- TONS of enemies everywhere!

Negatives:
- Campaign could have had another mission or 2
- The only mission I didn't like was the flying around in space, although short it wasn't needed
- Please allow people to have the same class in COOP, very annoying to have to switch


These are my thoughts so far after only beating the campaign, going to try some Coop next and maybe a little PVP but I don't see myself playing a ton of that. I will def be coming back to this game to in the future when more Coop missions are added and especially when the Horde mode is added, that should be wonderful fun with how good this combat system is.

Def one of the best Warhammer games to date, probably tied with GOW2 as my favorite all time Warhammer game and has made me reinstall GOW2, Hired Gun & Darktide again to get some more Warhammer action in, very good game and one of 2024's best without a doubt (Probably #3 on my top 10 list this year).

I do love my big epic, super long rpgs but I do love when a well done lean and mean campaign comes around that is about 7-8 hours and very well done. No filler, no extra bs, just get down to business and that is alot of fun. Well done to the devs, they nailed the Warhammer feel very well. As good as the first Space Marine game was, this is a good deal better imo, better graphics, combat is better and it has a more epic feel to it. Pretty much Space Marine 1 with classic Gears of War mix in, fantastic campaign overall.

FOR THE EMPEROR!

Que dire. N'étant qu'aux prémices de l'Hérésie d'Horus, j'avais quelques réserves quand à ce jeu : ne pas pouvoir profiter pleinement de l'univers et de ce qu'il avait à proposer. Ne pas tout comprendre. Quelle erreur. C'est beau, c'est bien fait, c'est efficace.

Ce jeu prend tout son sens en multijoueur : affronter des légions d'hérétiques ou des hordes de xénos avec de parfaits inconnus, ou des amis, c'est le pied TOTAL. On en redemande, et on en à JAMAIS assez de faire exploser des cranes d'aliens à coup de bolters. On est surpuissant, mais très vite submergé. Relever un allié au sol avant de repartir au combat a ses cotés n'a jamais été aussi épique. La sensation de tir est jouissive. Les finish sont bien gore, et on adore découper en deux ce qui nous tombe sous le gantelet énergétique.

Toujours lutter de toutes ses forces jusqu'au dernier ennemi, par ce qu'à l'arrivée, il y a toujours quelque chose à débloquer. Une couleur, un élément d'armure, une amélioration d'arme. Cela faisait des années, pour moi, que je n'avais plus connu ce légendaire ""aller, une dernière partie"". Et ça marche, par ce que l'on fini toujours par en relancer une.

C'est addictif. C'est un chef d'oeuvre en la matière. Space Marine 2, Saber et Focus donnent une sacré leçon aux autres studios qui, depuis quelques années, se reposent sur des acquis bancals et sur des lauriers devenus immérités.

On ne peut que IMPLORER à genoux le studio d'entretenir son jeu, d'apporter des nouveautés et des ajouts réguliers, car des pépites pareilles, ce n'est pas tout les jours que ça sort sur le devant de la scène vidéo ludique.

T L D R - Learn to dodge and parry to make combat make sense, there is not enough content to justify the price, and it's a cool glimpse into the 40k universe through the personalities of the characters. Also, the operations mode is fun and replayable, but the weapon progression system sucks.

It was refreshing but ironic to find authentic characters in peak fiction. The campaign story is just a glimpse into the grim dark of 40k, but more about the universe is revealed through the personalities of the fear incarnate warriors known as Space Marines and the machine cultists who assist them. Even though the story is short, through their dialogue and interactions you learn why the characters are motivated to continue existing in one of the bleakest, most depraved, and nightmarish universes ever conceived. No matter how bad things get, humanity keeps fighting back and life, uh, finds a way.

Operations mode multiplayer missions are fun, but the progression system is bad because by the time you start unlocking the higher weapons, you will be bored out of your gourd from doing the same mission(s) 40,000 times. You just unlock things far too long after your desire to grind expires for how repetetive the gameplay loop is.

There is way too little content in the launch week to justify the price of the game. I guess inflation does not only affect packages of bacon.

The tutorial is fun, but it did not adequately teach my inner ape how to use the dodge and parry mechanics. Once I learned how to frequently use dodge and parry to counterattack and stagger, the combat became more interesting and my survivability went up.

P.S. Why TF is the shield not attached to his arm? There are so many skull symbols, you could throw a dart at a Space Marine and it would hit 3 skulls while flying through the air.

月之玄殇,1,28.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198800719980/,"《星际战士2》：请告诉帝皇，我将为祂再次冲锋！并为此无悔！

9月9日忆战斗兄弟
独在异星屠异形，每逢佳节倍思亲。
遥知兄弟杀异端，遍砍头颅少一人。


要说9月，不少人最期待的游戏便是《战锤40k：星际战士2》了，前作《星际战士1》是十三年前的经典老游戏了，当时由Relic(水雷）制作。而《星际战士2》早已不是原先的开发团队，接手新作的制作组换成了Saber Interactive，他们比较出名的游戏便是以夸张的同屏僵尸数量著称的《僵尸世界大战》。
Saber Interactive所呈现的壮恢弘场景的画面配上全新引擎特效，无疑使本作成为战锤系列粉丝所能够体验到的迄今为止工业水平最高的游戏。
但非战锤系列粉丝，这款游戏不一定适合你。
首先是网络问题，本作的线上联机对外国玩家影响不大（这服务器问题估计一时半会改不了），但大部分国内玩家要开加速器才能稳定联机，如果你平时不常用加速器，就需要斟酌一下是否购买。
其次本作并不是一款无双割草游戏，如果你是想体验在虫海中一夫当关,万夫莫开，那可能有点难，本作PVE部分实际体验下来更偏向战术跟操作。

本作的玩法分为战役，PVE,PVP三个板块，我个人游玩了30多个小时，战役已通关，PVE已毕业一个角色，至于PVP，我个人对于竞技玩法不感冒就没玩。
先夸一下本作的战役玩法，战役游玩时间大概在7到8小时左右，游戏的前半段我们将面对遮天蔽日的泰坦虫族，后半段则是对上混沌星际战士军团“千疮之子”，最后2章的演出更是顶级！无论是画面演出，剧情走向，对于战锤系列粉丝都是一盘大餐。
（战役是没有收益的，但还是推荐先玩战役再玩PVE，可以获得最佳的剧情体验）
接着是“行动”，也就是PVE部分，PVE的任务关卡其实就是战役剧情的另一个视角，所以6个关卡基本还是战役的那几张图。
PVE可以选择6哥不同的兵种（职业），各有特色。
例如战术兵可提供高额的增伤扫描BUFF，突击兵（最菜职业）能凭借强大的机动性突入虫群（高难度上去送），先锋兵的钩锁可直接“切后排”攻击敌方的远程单位，重装兵则有着为团队提供更强生存能力的团体技能，本身坦度也不俗。
狙击兵能在战场后方利用高伤武器处理掉棘手敌人，还有着强力的隐身技能保护自己，而最后的特战兵是强力的移动炮台，可以倾泻出强大的火力。
完成PVE的关卡便能获得经验用来升级角色，角色升级后可以获得天赋点进一步特化职业特色跟强度，毕业一个角色大约要花费20到30多个小时。
另外不同的兵种还能使用三种不同的主，副，近战武器，，武器熟练度也需要肝，也都是独立的。比如你肝出来的满级武器，这个职业不适配，就得重新杀怪肝熟练度，熟练度升满后还要用金币＋武器数据解锁武器升级接着肝。
外观部件也需要肝，而且绝大数外观基本是换色皮，太肝了这个系统。
关卡也没啥随机元素，除了部分资源跟武器数据刷新的点不一样，偶尔会刷新出特种敌人跟BOSS，每次游玩的体验都大体相同，而且为了追求效率，目前版本大部分玩家只会刷1图跟2图，多刷几次真的很容易腻。
再来说说战斗系统，游戏采用了远近兼具的动作系统，同时还有闪避，格挡，处决等元素。
敌人发动蓝光攻击角色可以使用格挡招架（非蓝光也能档，但无法触发枪袭），发动红光攻击则要翻滚闪避，无论是闪避还是招架，只要完美触发了时机，便能直接秒杀小怪回复护甲，精英敌人则会施加一个红色瞄准印记，此时我们按下射击键便可进行一次“枪袭”造成大量伤害并回复护甲（小怪被打出失衡状态也能枪袭）。
敌人被打至残血后还能进行处决，游戏中每种怪物都有多种独特的处决动作，此外每一个处决动作都充满了番茄酱四溅的场面，展现出一种独特的暴力美学。
远程部分目前平衡一塌糊涂，版本主流武器是“热熔枪”，跟其他武器不是一个强度的（狙击武器跟榴弹伤害也还行），这武器不只伤害高，它一发还能把精英怪打出硬直，自带高穿透直接一发能打一群怪，另外残血了还能“吸血”电表倒转直接满血，能用“热熔枪""的职业天生高人一等。
近战系统倒是挺有趣的，每把武器都能通过轻重组合打出不同的连招派生，但近战很难打出硬直，高难度下被精英包围用近战很容易“猝死”，导致高难度近战又没啥存在感。
可以说游戏的PVE模式，目前实在是不尽人意，武器平衡稀烂，地图新鲜感不足，养成方面很肝，但又没有自由组合BD的爽感。

《战锤40k：星际战士2》总体而言还是瑕不掩瑜，战役模式大场景及气氛渲染到位，顶级演出，情绪价值拉满，加入的中文配音更是沉浸感拉满。
但PVE模式目前糟糕的土豆服务器，武器平衡稀烂，地图过少，养成玩法毫无深度，游玩20到30小时就令人感到乏味。
好在制作组画了不少“饼"",更新计划表都安排到了明年2025年了，还是可以期待一下的，毕竟他们之前做的僵尸世界大战也是不断更新了好多新内容口碑才慢慢变好的，所以我觉得可以期待一下后续的更新。",2024/9/12,zh-cn

Krystalchan,1,16.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pow20o09/,"Game is good, but has room for some extra polish or optimizations.

The story is a good power trip where the content feels challenging but you have the tools to do it. Some of the gimmicks wear themselves thin, even more so as a solo or duo where you have to trust the bots to deal the main damage over yourself (such as ripper segments). Thankfully these segments are few and far between. PVP is also fun with 6v6 matches and is enjoyable even though the modes are pretty basic.

My biggest complaint right now is the fact PVP map pool is only 3 maps. The road map indicates a new map in 2025 but that means 3+ months grinding on only the current small pool. This and the slow pace of unlocking gear in PVP, I can see being a point of burnout for people. Also PVP matches really need to shuffle teams as two three mans can queue snipe each other to doom stack a lobby. Just general flow around menuing for PVP is also kinda clunky between the amount of load screens and waiting. For instance you can't edit your loadout in match, you must finish your game, then load into your battle barge, go to the armory and wait for the robo boy to slowly come down all while a timer ticks for the next match. To the point why even bother loading into the barge when all of this could just be menus you can flip through post match. And on the point of load screens god they are a pain.

The storyline from the first Game continues. A true miracle after 13 years. Brothers rejoice.

The main focus is on PvE though.
Spawn points change with each playthrough.
The difficulty level is also freely selectable.
If one or two players are missing, the mission can still be started and a bot will join in.
This means PvE will still be playable in a few years.

So adjustments to the Meele class would be nice, but for now I'm happy with what I have.

Great job Saber Interactive.

May the Emperor bless you and give us part 3.",2024/9/12,en
Kinowek,0,11.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinowek/,"Once again, Steam could use a 'maybe' category for recommendation. This game looks and sounds beautiful. Enemies and NPCs look lore accurate, and for the most part act lore accurate, in a great way. The campaign is relatively short for the price however, and I'm really not interested in the multiplayer aspect at all.

That said, the single player would be improved greatly if the bot teammate AI was just a little better, or had a Mass Effect style order system, or even a priority target list you could set, to control where the bots focus their shooting and melee. Way too many times, the bots shoot at trash mobs, or even the small rat mobs that their guns won't even effect, instead of flying buffer enemies or any sort of real threats. They will also sometimes just lock up, seemingly overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemies running around.

Also, on Veteran difficulty and above, the guns feel ridiculously weak. You can empty your entire ammo supply, not just magazines, into some enemies and barely move their health bar, even with headshots. Also, whenever most enemies, even some borderline trash mobs die, they enter a flashing red 'Execute' state, which is useful for regaining armor in theory but less useful when dozens of them are in that state all over the map, and your AI teammates ignore them and let them heal up and reenter the fight.

The game also suffers from a DOOM style 'only one attack pattern matters' vs certain enemies, aka the dual sword wielding Tyranids, for example. If you don't counter their melee hit and then shoot them with the pistol (when a quicktime style indicator pops up), you are literally wasting time and ammo, and their 20 friends are jump stabbing you in the face and back.

The animations for melee attacks are also simply too slow, you can perfectly counter a literal half dozen swarmer enemies and kill them, and then get hit and damaged while STILL DOING the attack animation from another angle. Either make the animations WAY faster, or give some iframes in there, for playability.

The heavy bolter(full auto heavy weapon one) is great. What's not great however, is the fact that it counts as a fire and discard weapon, aka it cannot be reloaded from the many, many suspiciously placed ammo boxes all over enemy territory. That leads to another point, these are the least equipped space marines ever. Three person squads (for balance reasons according to the developers), with no medpacks on deployment, only 2-4 magazines, and a melee weapon? Also I've only had a jetpack once out of what seems to be 90% of the game so far, and no heavy weapon Space Marine squads are in sight. Only non-controllable vehicles in cut scenes.

This probably sounds overly negative, but the game is SO close to being amazing. Just better AI, more Ammo (for my shooty space marines), better kit selection before missions(medpacks, more ammo, grenade types, a heavy weapon, etc.) and it's an all time great game. It certainly looks and sounds like it already. Just a few numbers patches, or maybe eventually modders will save it.

If you play solo, look forward to rage against the braindead teammate AI, but it's probably a great game with a focused team of 3 human players.

Also, vs some of the large boss enemies, in particular Carnifex and the flying shielded caster thing... does my super mutant cyborg really take 3+ seconds to pick up a box of ammo or grenades? You are going to need to shoot these guys THOUSANDS of times, so you must scrounge ammo, and stopping to actually pick it up gets you swarmed by trash and unblockable boss attacks.

Somehow I suspect the developers won't do most of the changes I'm looking for, as this game has already sold very well. Hopefully some modders see it close to my way though!",2024/9/12,en

Recomiendo compra la versión Standard Edition, podrás jugar la campaña, las operaciones y la guerra eterna. Desde que inicias el tutorial o intro, esto se vuelve un auténtico desmadre, aplastando, descuartizando Aliens, te darás gusto amigo XD, jugar el intro con la dificultad ángel de la muerte ufff es una locura, es una autentica pasada, ya luego la jugabilidad se pone heavy heavy pana, el equilibrio en los demás mapas con la dificultad al tope, es la misma tortura de Shakira jajaja XD, mejor bajarle a normal, esta es unos de los puntos que deben mejorar, continuando cuando te dan los propulsores ufff otra vez vuelves a la vida de la destrucción XD, eres el mismo ángel caído XD. cuando te den la espada de energía ufff te sentirás como todo un jedi, recomendado te divertirás.

(POR FAVOR CREADORES tomen en cuenta esto) para la siguiente entrega
1-Agregar mas armas o que las armas se mejoren, porque la gran mayoría de armas no sirven para nada, solo necesitaras utilizar, el rifle bolter automático, el fusil de fusión, la pistola bolter, de ayi en adelante las demás armas quitando la espada de energía, lo demás no sirve.
2-Agregar bullet time cuando rematas con la Tecla E o cuando paras con la tecla C, uff eso seria épico.
3-Agregar mas variedad de vestimenta para poder utilizar en la campaña.

Temas resueltos después del parche del 11 de septiembre del 2024

(Ahora si esta equilibrada)1-Equilibra la dificultad, ya que después de la intro, los demás mapas están desequilibrados, mas sin juegas de 2 jugadores y si estas con la IA como uno de tus amigos, encomiéndate jajaj XD.
(Ahora si esta fluido el juego)2-Agregar que se mueva el personaje, que camine o corra, cuando dispara, no puede ser que se quede quieto recibiendo golpe, como si fuera una estatua.
(Ahora si se aprecia lo gráfico)3-Mejorar el renderizado al jugar cooperativo online, ya que cuando invitas a 1 amigo o 2 amigos para jugar cooperativo online, el renderizado baja o la calidad grafica del mapa baja, lo más loco es que si vuelve a entrar al mapa se optimiza, pero es un vaivén la calidad. (si no me equivoco por eso es que se realizara 1 parche o varios XD.
(Ahora si reacciona) 4-Optimizar o Mejorar la PARADA (Pulsas la Tecla C), contexto: cuando el enemigo se te abalanza hacia ti, sale un Círculo de Color celeste, esto debe mejorar, después de la intro esto debe mejorar, ya que muchas, pero muchas veces, al oprimir la tecla C, adivina no pasa absolutamente nada, quedas como autentico payaso esperando que haga la defensa que nunca hace, cuando son grupos pequeños de alienígenas, se percibe más, pero cuando son grupos grandes, esto falla casi el 95% de las veces.

Hauzer,1,10.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198110600600/,"Я не являюсь фанатом вселенной Warhammer, играл серию Vermintide и несколько часов поиграл в прошлую Space Marine (аж 13 лет назад!) мне первая часть вообще не понравилась, и на фоне других проектов того времени была серой, скучной, однообразной, что игру бросил. И вот выходит вторая часть и судя по оценкам и обзорам, большинство просто в восторге от нее. Я подсел на всеобщий хайп и купил игру, и вот пройдя ее полностью готов поделиться своим мнением, которое неоднозначное. Начинается все довольно бодро, масштабно и очень красиво, графика тут прям хороша, у тебя складывается ощущение, что ты играешь не побоюсь сравнения в DOOM от третьего лица, также море кровищи, зрелищные фаталити над оглушенными врагами и все в этом роде, потом ловишь себя на мысли, да нет это же космический Gears of War, только пила у тебя теперь не на пушке, а вшита в меч. Игра тебя несколько часов удивляет своим постоянным экшеном и ты думаешь ДА это определенно экшен года, но чем дальше продвигаешься по сюжету, тем больше играешь уже с ленцой, потому что сюжет очень простенький, этакий фильмец категории Б, враги одинаковые, вот просто CTRL+C CTRL+V, их реально всего 4-5 видов, это простые мобы жуки, потом жуки побольше, потом еретики дрищи и еретики побольше, ну и пара солдат, тоже из разряда ONE KILL. И со временем этот однообразный геймплей жутко утомляет, потому что игровые ситуации все одинаковые, получили задание от тупого (об этом дальше) командира, полетели, высадились и стрельба бесконечная с одинаковыми врагами. Командир затылок еще тот, то есть ваш командир, не главный герой. Ситуация - ГГ говорит мне нужно два отряда, командир отвечает - могу дать шестерых солдат, ну ок. Следующая миссия ГГ просит 6 солдат, командир отвечает могу дать трех. Проходит всего ёптер мать один час и командир говорит - я отправил туда то туда то два отряда, то есть отправляет собака такая, а тебе шиш с маслом. Дальше больше, твои напарники это те еще два тела, в одной миссии у одного из них на почве мести засвистела фляга, ну дали ему в тык и привели в чувство, следующая миссия, засвистела фляга у другого (он мне кстати вообще не понравился как персонаж и бесил всю игру), опять дали в тык и окей. Ну тупых ситуаций и ребячества в этой игре хватает. Битвы с боссами неинтересные и однотипные, только финальный босс хоть как то порадовал. Ну вот и всё. В целом, если играть в игру просто по паре часов в день, чтобы расслабиться, она идеально подходит, олдскульная, брутальная стрелялка от третьего лица, реально не думал, что после многих кинематографических игр за эти годы, мы будем рады таким играм, которые до нельзя примитивные, красивые, но простые и звезд с неба не хватают. Все потому, что сейчас упор на онлайн, на донат, на игры сервисы и различные культуры, которые не будем затрагивать в этом обзоре, вот на фоне всего этого Space Marine 2 отдушина. Играть или не играть решит каждый сам, я вот подсел на хайп и не сказать, что пожалел, игра хорошая, но под конец утомляет и с простым сюжетом. Оценка 7.5 баллов, есть затравка на следующую часть, но разработчикам нужно постараться в плане истории и разнообразия.",2024/9/12,ru

Imagine ser um Space Marine, uma máquina de guerra geneticamente modificada que mistura o Hulk com o Robocop, só que com mais músculos, menos remorso e a capacidade de fazer buracos gigantes em qualquer coisa que ouse existir na sua frente. Agora, adicione um universo onde todo mundo está basicamente tendo o pior dia da sua vida todos os dias, e pronto, você tem Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2.

Neste jogo, você é Titus, o Space Marine que já gastou todas as suas férias e está eternamente preso em um ciclo de violência, mas ele nunca reclama, porque reclamar é para os fracos. Seu trabalho? Simples: sobreviver a hordas de alienígenas, demônios e qualquer outra coisa que o universo cuspa na sua direção. Se você acha que isso soa um pouco estressante, relaxe — Titus não tem tempo para esses sentimentos. Seu único hobby é explodir inimigos com armas que fazem as metralhadoras convencionais parecerem brinquedos de criança.

Os gráficos são tão detalhados que dá pra ver os músculos das suas veias — sim, seus músculos têm veias próprias, é assim que os Space Marines rolam. A quantidade de sangue e tripas por pixel é insana, o que faz você se perguntar: “Será que eles têm um departamento de limpeza nos planetas imperiais?”. Porque sério, o lugar fica uma zona toda vez que você aparece.

A jogabilidade? Simplesmente perfeita se você gosta de avançar sem pensar, explodir coisas e gritar ""PORQUE O IMPERADOR PEDE!"" a cada cinco minutos. Seus oponentes vão de “ah, isso foi fácil” para “espera, isso é uma onda infinita de inimigos?”. E tudo isso enquanto você está basicamente fazendo crossfit com armadura e armas que pesam tanto quanto um carro.

Em suma, é como pegar um blockbuster de ação dos anos 80, misturar com ficção científica hardcore e dar a tudo uma dose de esteróides. Se você já sonhou em resolver todos os problemas do universo com uma serra elétrica gigante, este é o jogo para você. E lembre-se: no futuro sombrio do 41º milênio, não há tempo para terapia... só para carnificina.

E no final das contas, quando você é esmagado por um Tiranídeo gigantesco, há uma satisfação estranha em gritar com orgulho: ""PELO IMPERADOR!""",2024/9/12,pt

My Name Is Jefftor,1,70.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheVoidOfJefftor/,"After reading the negative reviews and assessing their statements, I have decided I should write a review.
One of the biggest complaints I saw was people complaining that the 2 highest difficulties of the campaign ""Require"" Co-Op. Whether it was because missions were hard, the AI was incompetent, or enemies took too many bullets to kill, requiring you to use a ""Janky"" melee system. I beat the campaign on the highest difficulty solo; one of my friends beat the campaign solo on that difficulty as well. News flash. A co-op game is usually balanced around playing co-op with either friends or other people.
The second complaint I saw was the game being ""stiff"" or ""unresponsive"" and the combat being janky. The combat is supposed to feel slow. Poorly timed dodges and parries are punished. Spamming attacks are supposed to be unrewarding at best and punished at worst. People kept mentioning that they can't cancel a dodge. I didn't even know that was a normal feature in games. Usually you press the button, action happens, and then you resume. Sometimes games will let you ""Cancel"" something if it's a long action like a reload or mantling a ledge.
PVP isn't super unbalanced. There are some tweaks that need to be made, but on the whole it's enjoyable as long as your teammates realize this isn't a normal shooter. It's more akin to CS or Valorant. You want to play with your team and play Objectives. A solo player can pop off, but more often than not, a solo player gets caught out and killed quickly.
To the people who are saying this is another ""short life"" game because it has low re-playability. Unlike a lot of other games that are trying to be in this space, it has a road map. We know what's coming and when to expect it. Thats more than I can say for a lot of games like this.

If the Devs can keep a steady stream of content then i can see this game doing really well. If not, for those who seek a more PVE style of game play, they might burn out pretty quick due to the repetitious nature of the multiplayer operations, even though the enemies are procedural (kinda), the mission objectives can get a little stale. However, the progression system and different classes help for those who seek to grind like i do, i can see myself easily putting 100+ hours chasing those levels and gear.

Martynes,1,74.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/martynes/,"На мой взгляд игра шикарная.

Боёвка брутальная, много как ХтХ, так и пострелушек, в зависимости от того, с чем бегаешь (и каким классом, если говорить про операции/PvP).
Завезли систему уклонений и парирований атак, после которых можно бесплатный болт противнику в лоб прописать (даже если патроны кончились – потому что Император помогает).
Пушек приличное количество – в основном болтеры разных видов, но есть ещё мельты, плазмы, снайперская лазпушка, несколько видов оружия ближнего боя.

В основной кампании куча всяких крутых постановочных штук как для тех, кто хотя бы немного увлекается настолкой, так и для незнакомых с вахой полностью – сюжет хоть и простенький, но антураж эпичный.
Игра имеет связь с первой частью, но и без прохождения первой части всё равно всё будет понятно, за исключением пары нюансов.
Места действия меняются постоянно – тропические леса, заводы механикус, готишный город-улей, мрачная планета-гробница (натурально планета, которую используют чисто чтобы народ хоронить) и ещё более мрачные подземелья этой планеты.
Кампанию можно проходить соло или в коопе до трёх человек.

Плюс есть чисто коопный режим на троих, события в котором разворачиваются параллельно тем событиям, которые происходят в основной кампании и с этими событиями непосредственно связаны.
В этом режиме можно гонять за десов шести разных классов из любого ордена первого основания, ЧХ, ДС, неизвестного основания, кучку саксессоров Ультрамаринов и любой орден, который ты сам сможешь собрать из доступных красок/лекал. Даже символику предателей завезли.
Кастомизировать можно не только броню, но и снарягу – как в плане внешнего вида, так и в плане характеристик. В наличии прокачка самих классов, которая позволяет открывать всякие персональные и командные перки.
Операций всего шесть, но обещают в будущем больше добавить. В целом, как минимум несколько раз их пройти будет интересно, на разных сложностях и разными классами, т.к. там врагов на тебя разными дозами выкидывает ""режиссёр"".

Мультиплеер простенький. Я не фанат PvP, так что мало что могу про него сказать. В наличии три режима: командный десмач, контроль территории и контроль точек.

Бывают проблемы с соединением – после релиза для всех их стало меньше, вроде.
Сегодня катч вышел, после него весь вечер никаких проблем с коннектом не было.

Если тезисно, игра прям сделана по ГОСТУ 2010 года, геймплей чисто консольные игры того времени по типу; Gears of War или Transformators War of CyberStyl.
Кишко-образные локации начиненные противниками разной степени впитываемости урона, подбираемое оружие на локации, сегменты где ну... обязательно надо что-то оборонять, сtrl c+ctrl v и игра готова.

Да, разработчики пытались привнести ""новшества"" по типу парирования, блока, там... ультимейтов, сочных добиваний которые быстро приедаются, но игра прям веет душком того времени, и это , игра добротно сделана и все же если опустить подьебки в ней есть кое что aхyительное, из WWZ.

Из-за этого в битве ощущениe по типу НЫА НА БЛЯTЬ НА НА ХYЙ УМРИ Я EБAНУТЫЙ. Импакт в игре хорош, звуки бахают и трахают, количеством крови на экране можно перекрасить черное море в красное, космодёсны орут что есть мощи в пылу битвы, вообщем шик.

В игре мало видов уникального оружия (все модификации болтера это не отдельные пушки, сразу говорю), и мало разновидностей врагов.
Да тут вам встретиться
Если говорить про сложность, то проходил сюжет на ангеле смерти по коопу с моим кентом, не могу сказать что сложность прям пuздец пердак обнулился, но игра не совсем справедлива к игроку, у меня ровно 2 претензии:




Про сюжет мне сказать нечего, в силу того что я свечку над 55 толмутами лора не держал, отсылки на знаковые события игры не выкупил, (да и я обычный человек поймите) кроме в голову ничего не приходит.
Классические терки внутри коллектива чтобы придать команде дуболомов хоть чуточку глубины, поиск в течении всех миссий чего-там, сказать кому-то что, неожиданный там поворот, эпик батл в конце с огромной кокус биг чуси болс крагозяброй the end. У меня сюжет уже почти выветрился, хотя прошел игру я вчера.
Дизайн в игре, ну мне сказать нечего кроме как отвал башки, очень красивая и вкусная пилюля, гигантизм с ноткам вахапанка (смешение средневековья и будущего) дают игре свой неповторимый облик, даже через призму пластилина...

Помните я говорил про комикон костюм, так вот я отсылал к графике.
Оптимизация в игре нормальная, на моём сетапе RX5600XT RYZEN 5 3600 (4-ех летний бабуин) игра выдает 45-60 фпс на смешанных (средне-высоко-низкие) настройках. И разумеется люди доeбутся что у меня комп древнее палеозоя, но почему то не у меня одного проблема с недогрузом текстур. Почти все прохождение земля напоминала пнгэшку сартира в приближении Х100, а космостарсы выглядели как нечто среднее между Базом Лайтером, и сыром ( и да игра на SSD 980 SASUNG стоит). Обожаю лого амд перед игрой, прям стандарт качества.

Тут краткo
PVE зашло, классы и прокачка оружия, уникальные миссии которые переплетены (мох) с сюжетом, считайте еще одна компания,
PVP не интересно, не играл. 0/10 тк если бы заинтересовало поставил бы 10/10
(если по чесноку проблемы с соединением были, нормально поиграть было сложно)

Does it deliver? I will explain below, starting with the campaign, then the MP modes ending on the technical details and overall thoughts.

Campaign


Space Marine 2 puts you into the armour of a Space Marine 40.000 years into the future. A genetically engineered super soldier that is 3 metres tall, a space marine is almost indestructible, they are faster and stronger than any normal human and some of them can be hundreds of years old. They are wrapped in myth and legend and are skilled warriors beyond measure. They are a bulwark against terror in a universe that has known only war for centuries.

Humanity is fighting against horrors beyond their comprehension and while there are several factions of said horrors, the main one we're dealing with here, is a Tyranid Hive fleet.
Tyranids are a bug/lizard like faction that swarm the universe to consume biomass, they evolve at an incredibly fast rate and can counter almost any known weapon or biological agent known to mankind and speed is of the essence when dealing with them. A planet attacked by them never truly recovers and there are millions and millions gunning for you.

The story picks up quite some time after Space Marine 1, and you are Titus. While I won't go into much story detail. The tutorial and thus the introduction to Space Marine 2, immediately shows what stakes you're up against and sets the tone for the entire campaign.

The campaign is a great introduction to some of the scale that Warhammer 40K offers and its bleak hopeless setting, there is only war and it shows. The campaign is filled with gigantic set pieces, wild lush alien forests and jungles, gigantic cities with massive cathedrals or abandoned bunkers and dark secrets. Everywhere you see signs of the carnage that happens all around you and the grimdark setting that 40K invented really shines here.

Gameplay wise the game is reminiscent of Space Marine 1, just improved upon. combat is fast and diverse and the game expects you to switch tactics on the fly.

As a space marine you have a great arsenal of weapons to use, from the infamous Bolt weapons, massive assault weapons that fire a bolt, a massive rocket propelled round that embeds itself in the target and detonates, to melta guns, plasma guns, heavy bolters. But you also have several melee weapons, from the Chainsword, to the Thunderhammer. Why? because the combat in this games switches between thinning out hordes and hordes of enemies before they reach you and then turns into a hack and slash brawler fest.

The combat is incredibly dynamic and it keeps you on your toes especially on higher difficulties. Luckily you are not alone in this rigorous slaughter fest. Titus has two other space marines with him, which can either be controlled by your friends or the computer. While the bots lack some finesse and tend to focus on direct threats, they are a welcome addition. Just don't expect too much of them, they are bots. they beeline for you to get you up if you're down but not out and they can distract some enemies.

The campaign will take you around 10 to 12 hours to complete and my time with it was enjoyed very much, I had several ""Holy sh!t"" moments and I felt like a space marine, the story is all I hoped for after 13 years and I loved it.


The multiplayer is the other part of Space Marine 2. It can be separated in two parts: PVE and PVP.


PVE is one of the parts that shines here, during the campaign several squads often help Titus with secondary objectives, the PVE or Operations gives you control of these squads. You can run this with up to two of your friends or bots, but trust me, play with friends.

You have six classes with each of them having a distinct role, weapon set and main ability.
From the standard space marine with bolter and chainsword, to the bulwark with shield and sword to a stealthy sniper

Each class has weapon upgrades, perks for the weapons and the class itself and customisation to unlock.
Yes you can create your very own space marine or unlock several other space marine chapters and customise those and while the customisation needs some polish, it's incredibly varied.

There are currently six operations most of which coincide with the campaign, they can take 30 to 45 minutes to complete and on higher difficulties they require coordination, tactics and sharing of resources.

They often feel like mini raids and they are incredibly fun to do, however in contrast to games such as Darktide I wonder how fun these missions stay, they feel less like a horde shooter and more like a mini campaign, while enemy variety and objectives can switch around in an operation, I feel it might get repetitive. Yet they are like I said incredibly fun and I will probably keep coming back to them, just because of the gameplay loop.


The second MP mode is Eternal War, a 6v6 PVP mode with the same classes as the Operations mode, just different progression. There three modes, King of the Hill, Seize ground (several points to capture) and Annihilation (team death match) and as of writing 3 maps.

The gameplay in pvp is great, classes are diverse and while some balancing might be happening it is incredibly fun to play despite it's lack of maps and modes. I spend several hours playing this and the tactical aspect in it is really fun, it isn't just run and gun, you have to counter other classes, bullwarks can block damage, snipers sneak around, assault's jump in to cut you down. There are tons of cool skirmishes to be found and it's an absolute blast.

However it's also the most bare bones part of the game. While the customisation for space marines is great, the chaos marines lack customisation, every class is attached to a traitor legion and is thus bound to it. You cannot play an iron warrior vanguard for instance and the armor itself is barely customisable, sometimes even not. For some of the more chaos minded players this can be quite a big letdown.

The other issue is that while it is 6v6 I can only make a lobby with three people, not six or four, locking out some of my friends to play with, I get it for PVE, I don't for PVP.

PVP feels like something added later in development and I hope that the devs do expand upon it with some much needed Quality of Life changes.


The game is quite CPU heavy, I have a i9-10850k CPU and a RTX4070 TI SUPER, the game runs like a charm in 90% of the game, but some areas and missions are incredible heavy on the CPU so much I wonder if it's a bit of optimalisation. Some area's that are small tank my frames, while some large open areas I run at a solid 80 FPS on ultra settings.

Besides that though, the game is beautiful to look at and effects, lighting, textures are all incredibly impressive, from the sparks of a broken cable to the blood that flies around.

The sound design is really well done and weapon sounds pack the punch you expect them to, every bolt fired, every enemy screech, every punch thrown is of high quality and this combined with the graphical design makes this a very immersive 40K game.


Despite some personal gripes and an in my opinion a bare bones PVP, this game has been worth the wait, it build upon the foundation of Space Marine 1 and improved it immensely. It offers something for older fans and something for newer fans of 40K and it is an incredible home-coming or introduction to the Space Marine franchise and thus Warhammer 40.000. It's an incredibly brutal, fun third person action game and the gameplay loop is quite addicting.

Sabre shows it understands 40K and this game is an ode to it.

CoalFire,1,77.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CoalFire/,"Campaign: one of the best I've played in recent memory - this is the only part I can recommend
PvE: repetitive and loses steam after about 3 runs of each map
PvP: not my jam, no opinion, have not played

Overall the combat and general gameplay is some of the most satisfying I've seen since something like Gears but without all the cover nonsense and the first run of the campaign has some real jaw dropping moments in both visuals and reveals.

However, if you're looking for more than the campaign, this is hard to recommend. Much like Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood, World War Z, Darktide, etc, there's just nothing to do in the PvE Operations mode except grind out cosmetics and passives. That might be enough for some, but it lacks any of the systems that make something like Destiny, Warframe, Deep Rock Galactic, Remnant, or the plethora of other rougelikes out there that do so much with mapgen and other secondary systems that make each run feel like a run, not just going through the same motions again. I'm never excited by anything that's gonna drop from a mission, it's just ""cross the finish line this many times"" for your next passive/cosmetic.

Cosmetics are awesome, classes are fine, progression kinda sucks since you only unlock one row at a time. Not sure I'll be playing long enough to max a single class despite only playing two of them. Passives are... there? They all feel like relatively minor gameplay bonuses that help steer your playstyle, but not one so far has made me excited to unlock or feel it was worth working towards. They feel more like bypasses to some inconvenince rather than some Astartes-level power. I don't think I'd be able to tell an endgame level build from an early game one from gameplay alone.

Would be awesome if in new game + you could play the campaign with your custom marine so 60% of the PvE missions were playable with the PvE classes. I think that's my biggest issue, the best PvE content isn't what you get to replay for progression and what's there to replay gets stale fast. Really hope to see some updates to the operations modes that make them more fun to replay. Modifiers, loot drops that persist after a play session, consumable buffs, unique mission rewards, map variants, mapgen, really anything except playing the same mission over and over with some different combat pacing each time.

This review is coming from a perspective of a 40k fan. I am relatively new though, only 5 years ago did I discover this universe, which is quite recent for a universe thats been around since 1987. Since my intoduction I have several painted armies (a space marine one among them) alongside having played some games and listened to a lot of Warhammer books and lore over the years.

Warhammer 40K : Space Marine 2 is a game that absolutely delivers on the experience it was aiming to create while going above and beyond for some aspects while fumbling tiny things along the way. I am pointing this out because this is getting increasingly unusual in the game industry nowadays. Most games coming out trying to sell you a live service while the game is not finished enough to be able to do so. Meanwhile this dev team seems to have taken their time to release a complete product that gives a solid foundation to making a live service work. 3 separate modes, all with a different focus and gameplay experience. Its quite refreshing, but that does not make the game automatically perfect. Lets talk about all of these modes and my thoughts on them.

Campaign: (no spoilers)

This mode continues the story of Demitrian Titus, the protagonist of the first game, with a fancy new narrative 13 years after the games release. Just like the other modes, you can play this mode cooperatively with 2 of your friends, and does a nice job introducing the mechanics of the game in a fun way. The campaign itself is short but sweet, and intentionally tries not to drag on to long, which is good in my opinion because you can't do much character work with a space marine because they are emotionless supersoldiers. The appeal of the campaign are the missions, and the set pieces within them. The 40k universe is bombastic yet intriguing and mysterious, and watching Titus and his team fight through futuristic gothic cities actively being destroyed by the tyranid invasion one moment and navigating through his chapters space ship with tons of details and lore is really fun and engaging. Its like a rollercoaster ride of the 40k universe where they show a lot of the unique and awesome stuff this universe has to offer. I do think it would have been smart of explain some more concepts, especially the ones directly related to the story's plot. A lot of times characters talk about in universe concepts, and people who are new to 40K will just not understand because its never explained. Its tottally playable and comprehensible to a person new going in, but I think its important to explain more stuff to really get them excited about the nuance 40k has compared to other sci-fi universes.

PVE Operations:
This mode allows your to play several missions losely related to the campaign story. Instead of Titus and his squad, you'll be able to play as 6 different classes, and make your own Space Marine. You'll be able to fully customize the look of your character, while completing missions allows you to level up and access new perks and abilities to make your guy stronger over time and really pick a playstyle you like. For 40k fans this is a dream come true since building and painting miniatures is a huge part of this hobby and the amount of customization is pretty vast for game that has just released. Its also not tied to microtransactions and all of the customization (except for a couple skins related to the gold and ultra edition) are earnable through playing the game. No ingame cash shop or lootboxes. The gamemode focusses on replayability with a good variety of maps, enemies and classes alongside the 4, soon to be 5 difficulties, makes it enjoyable over a long period of time. There is also an AI director tha mixes the missions up and tries to suprise you with changes in the enemies that show up and the objectives you must complete along the way. I have some issues with balancing though. The hardest difficulty feels very unstable to play right now, it feels you need to get lucky in order to win, but it’s very satisfying once you do. I also think the Thousand Sons faction are not very fun to fight currently of the way the units are balanced, totally fixable though. Focus has already promised to add more missions, weapons and enemies in the future which will be important to its life service, which in my opinion has the most potential in this game mode.

PVP Eternal War:

I played the least amount of PVP up until now, but it has pleasantly surprised me. It’s structured as a 6vs6 contest where Space Marines go up against Chaos Space Marines, marines who have betrayed the imperium and have sided with the bad guys. There are a couple modes to pick from, and they are all good fun to play with the same 6 classes from PVE. There only 3 maps though, and unlike the Campaign and PVE, there is not a lot of spectacle going on around or inside of them. Instead, this mode is focused on giving you a more competitive experiences, the 6 classes are all rebalanced to facilitate skill expression and game knowledge. The more you play, the more stuff you unlock for your class and once you get the hang of its surprisingly fun and way more intricate than you thought at first. Don’t overlook it, it might be really your thing.

Conclusion:

To me a perfect game is one that gets a lot of little things right, but at the same time, its art, and how it makes you feel is more important than examining and criticizing every detail. Space Marine 2 gives you the power fantasy of you being among the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes, something every Warhammer nerd fantasizes about ever since they started painting miniatures or reading/listening to the lore of this amazing universe. You get to go along this personal story of Titus to see something curated and then make your own based on the space marine you decide to make for PVE and PVP. The core gameplay is rock-solid and satisfying, with a lot of inspiration taken from DOOM while keeping its own style from the previous game. Artistically and graphically the game looks exactly like fans would envision the 40K universe alongside the overall sound design being a straight 10. The performance overall is impressive considering how many enemies can appear on screen on top of the orchestra of chaos that’s happening around you.

This by far is the best 40k game I’ve played so far and deserves all the praise and occasional criticism its receiving. I think thats because people, particularly 40k fans, care about this game and its future; the developers have created an awesome foundation for years of live service support and seem committed to fixing issues through their transparent feedback system. The game has already succeeded critically and financially, now it’s up to the devs build on it. If they do, and they are going to from the looks of their roadmap and their history as a developer, I’ll be there playing who knows how many years from now. If they somehow don’t, this game is still an incredible game and is easily worth the 60 you put in.

Every single gameplay aspect has something holding it back:

- Melee (not enough stagger/damage on higher difficulties especially annoying with the hammer),
- Shooting (barely any gun feels powerful and most of them sound weak too, it's just a feeling though damage is ok)

- Executions/Finishers and other animations where you cant control your character do not have enough invulnerability frames so you take lots of damage without any means to avoid it.

In the end it doesn't matter cause you still feel like a Space Marine and some of the missions are breathtakingly beautiful, just not the second coming of Christ that most of people are telling me this game is.

Kuranes,1,30.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkchant_es/,"En el momento de realizar esta reseña llevo acumuladas 13 horas de juego, principalmente en el modo Campaña y algo del modo Operaciones, y el juego, aunque tiene algunos apartados a mejorar, roza el sobresaliente.

Mi experiencia se basa sobre todo en el modo de dificultad Veterano y jugando con amigos en cooperativo, ya que pienso que esta es la auténtica y mejor experiencia que el juego ofrece. Superar al extremo una situación que parecía imposible y que todo tu equipo sienta la euforia de la victoria es una gran experiencia.

El juego es un portento a nivel visual, y al menos para equipos modernos está bien optimizado, permitiendo jugar en modo Calidad con bastante fluidez a la que tengas un equipo decente. La ambientación, el mundo de Warhammer 40K, los seres que lo habitan y la escala de sus conflictos están perfectamente recreados. Es increíble la cantidad de cosas que llegan a suceder en pantalla sin que el rendimiento se resienta.

Aunque el transcurso del juego sea lineal, los escenarios son bastante amplios, ricos en detalles y tienen bastantes recovecos donde se esconden alijos de armamento, recursos o secretos. Dicho esto, en este caso la linealidad, lejos de ser algo negativo, le sienta perfectamente al juego, ya que la intensidad y la tensión del conflicto se perderían con un mundo más abierto. Tal vez sí estaría bien contar con mayor exploración y opciones en la Barcaza, pero es algo que ya está planeado para futuras temporadas.

La personalización de los personajes de los modos multijugador está bastante bien, aunque echo en falta más variedad de piezas, y sobre todo poder cambiar el rostro del personaje (¡Quiero a mi lobo espacial barbudo y pelirojo!), pero confío en que estas opciones que faltan lleguen con expansiones de contenido.

A nivel jugable ofrece un sistema de combate bastante más profundo de lo que cabría esperar en un principio, ya que cuenta con un sistema de combos en el que puedes detonar un ataque potente en cualquier momento, de forma que cuanto más esperes para hacerlo mayor será el riesgo, pero también el daño causado a los enemigos. Por ejemplo, si lo detonamos en el primer ataque, daremos una patada, en el segundo un empujón y en tercero un pisotón que lanzará a los enemigos por los aires y los aturdirá.

También cuenta con un sistema de bloqueos (parry) y esquivas, que bien utilizados nos permitirán también aturdir a los enemigos y acabar con ellos rápidamente, para regenerar nuestros escudos, aumentando nuestra capacidad de supervivencia.

En cuanto a las armas a distancia, la sensación a los mandos es buena, aunque bastante similar a lo que ya hemos visto en muchos otros juegos de acción. Eso sí, tanto en combate a melee como a distancia, el juego ofrece una enorme variedad de armas, así que tendremos que decidir cuál utilizar en cada situación o cuál se adapta mejor a nuestro estilo de juego.

Por último, en combate cada personaje o clase tiene una habilidad especial única que se tiene que cargar antes de ser utilizada, pero que nos permite en muchas ocasiones darle la vuelta a una situación desfavorable.

En nivel Veterano, el juego dista mucho de ser un mata-mata, siendo necesario analizar el entorno, identificar las mejores zonas donde buscar cobertura, o dónde emboscar a los enemigos, así como trazar un plan entre todos los jugadores para optimizar sus esfuerzos.

Como puntos negativos, destacaría algunos errores puntuales que hacen que nuestro personaje atraviese elementos que no debería, algún enemigo que se queda atrapado con algún elemento del escenario, unas animaciones faciales que podrían ser algo más expresivas y las desconexiones del servidor, que aunque no son algo frecuente, cuando ocurren son bastante molestas. También hubiese estado bien contar con algo más de variedad de situaciones, ya que a pesar de que cuenta con algunos momentos especiales, otros tantos se repiten demasiado. Y por último, algún menú puede llegar a ser confuso al principio.

En resumen, a falta de probar el PVP, y que algunos de los errores comentados se vaya corrigiendo, me parece un juego que todo seguidor del género de acción o del mundo de Warhammer 40K debería probar, sobre todo en su modo cooperativo, tanto en Campaña como en Operaciones, ya que es un juego bastante bueno y lo será aún más con las expansiones que están por venir.",2024/9/9,es

Encoutered a few annoyances:
- menuing not being too convinient (mostly, I dislike that it takes two screens to set the difficulty+mission combo in the coop mode - it really really REALLY should be one screen). I'd love to see this polished up.
- the game will queue you into lobbies where someone is already playing your class, forcing you to change your class. I feel like that's a bit meh, since I enjoy playing one class for long sessions.
- very rarely (happened about three times in the 18 hours I've played so far) the game will lock you in place for a few seconds after a finisher animation - you're invincible and it'll recover, but it ruins the momentum, allowing the enemies to move away, which is a slight problem for any melee class.

And that's about it. Everything else is awesome. This feels exactly how I'd imagine a supersoldier smashing through the battlefield. The combat system has this heaviness to it, and your hits matter.

我妻渡,0,30.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/woqidu/,"游戏的底子很不错，不管是音乐建模场景都做得很好很有代入感，战役的体验我能给八分，就是有点不够玩。
至于这个联机PVE模式，不管是奖励，难度还是服务器，三个方面都很让人不满意。
一，奖励层面
一把游戏辛辛苦苦打下来，流程基本上是30分钟往上，花了很多的时间精力，但是给的奖励很少。经验和货币都很抠，而且最让人恶心的是基因种子和武器数据都要你自己找，本来地图就很大了，东西要自己找，位置还是随机的有时候一把打下来还没找到。这点给人的挫败感特别强。
希望能做一些优化，至少改成一把打完结算就能给一个武器数据和基因种子吧。
二，难度方面
这个游戏的PVE难度真的是我见过最难的几个，玩家可以操控的角色的机体性能甚至没有隔壁暗潮的贼配军强，动作僵直很大，人物也很脆很脆，而且打高难度的话很难回复血量一直都是危险线。
还有刷的精英和小怪，你打精英就会被小怪潮围住，你清小怪就会被精英各种恶心，导致我玩起来觉得我被奸奇和泰伦霸凌了。你说你就算不是个爽游，至少也不能是个联机魂游吧，大部分玩家是想来解压来爽的，不是来赎罪远征来坐牢的。
三，服务器方面
这个服务器真的烂，我以为隔壁暗潮已经是亚空间服务器了，我打了200小时暗潮也只是偶尔会遇到掉线闪退连不上的问题。你这一个主打联机体验，长线运营的游戏，服务器比亚空间还可怕，不是卡加载，就是连不上。跟朋友联机不是他掉就是我掉，真的太差劲了。
只能说这游戏的底子真的蛮不错的，只要能把难度优化好，服务器整的正常一点，多给点奖励降降肝度，还是能变成一个很好的游戏的。在他把这一切做好之前我这个差评不会改的。",2024/9/9,zh-cn

As a 40K fan from the books to the games, I am overly pleased and blown away at the game's detail, gameplay and scope.

The gameplay is clearly a step-up from the simplicity of the first game, adding in just the right amount of abilities, combat mechanics and weaponry.

The campaign's story is hype and larger in scope compared to the first game.

The PvE missions which are closely tied to the campaign are impressive and fun (adds to replayability). At some points I was reminded of Destiny's raids in terms of scale and puzzles (just slimmed down). I am very excited to hear that more of these PvE ops will be added for free in the future. Eternal War PvP is short and sweet, along with what feels like a good balance of classes and perks.

The game's linear progression in the campaign and short single-player reminds me of games from a decade ago, matching the first game's length. If you really enjoyed the first one, this is your new best friend.

Technical issues like crashing in loading screens, crashing after mission completes, server drops, and other small bugs are occasional but not extreme.

Cutlass,0,51.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/uredoom/,"let me preface this review, it is amazing fun, its beautiful on PC with smooth controls, its campaign is fantastic, a decent amount of customisation rounds it all out, I can see myself able to play this game for many hours.

However, there are some issues, some normal for any games launch as disappointing as they are, some decisions that are just outright stupid until these are fixed even though I love it I cant recommend it.

first and foremost, offline progress is not counted towards your account in operations, now some people have said its an anti cheating measure and I can see that perspective however it pails in comparison to the complete struggle that is trying to play the game in online, as you can expect, like many games of this era online play is wrought with server issues, disconnects mid session, finding it near impossible to get a game going, lag-spikes and jittering all the common symptoms, what this equates too is a game that forces you to play online to progress your account, while being barely able to support online play at all.

this carry's on, if you get disconnected mid session which is very common, you lose all progress, all rewards collected in the mission, you cannot rejoin the game in a standard manner, you cannot carry on the mission with bots in offline mode (even if you could no rewards are likely still an issue.) you get the pure pleasure of being told to go stuff yourself and restart from scratch, one only has so many hours in a day, don't make us waste them.

it is mind blowing to me how one can create a game as beautiful and fun as this and then completely drop the ball at what is completely bloody obvious, the game at launch WILL have server issues, so here's a crack brained idea, maybe don't punish all of your players for the possible action of 1% of players that will cheat in offline mode, in a PVE mission mode if that even was the reasoning behind this decision, its truly mind boggling, Total Biscuit would call it a piece of art with a dumb-ass poking holes in it with a pitchfork, Saber are actively harming players with weak or intermittent internet signals, which makes up a far greater majority, even when the server issues are fixed, which I am sure they are working on.

There are game breaking bugs as well, if you die in some campaign missions on harder difficulties, the ammo boxes disappear, with no spoilers, this makes the mission impossible to progress, not because you cant just chain sword them, but there are enemies and objects you have to shoot, with no ammo to do so.

until bug fixes are done, offline mode grants progression, the servers are fixed, and some truly baffling decisions are reassessed I strongly recommend waiting for the game to go on sale which by then it will hopefully be fixed, or borrow the game and enjoy the best parts about it offline.

you have every part of a great meal here Saber, stop messing it up, you are proactively harming players.",2024/9/8,en

Uh...well...
There's Space marines
Loading screens
And buggy cutscenes...

Oh and chainswords....
Mother
F*cking
C H A I N S W O R D S !

In all seriousness yeah its an alright enough game with a short but decent campaign (albeit some aforementioned cutscene errors or bugs such as where they either freeze but the audio continues or its the opposite of the audio lagging behind the visuals of a cutscene).

Combats fun allowing you to pull off some cool as finishers to enemies to regain health and shields (finishing moves in action games is always a win) but some of the controls can feel quite janky with awkward keybinds set by the game for pc.

The operations co-op mode currently has an error where you can get stuck in the hub after readying up for a level and would certainly benefit from some variety, otherwise the same 6 levels could get repetitive for some people, I like to think of it like its Left 4 Dead where you can play through the same levels countless times but the game play is what keeps it fun, but some more random/less linear objectives if possible could probably help make the levels feel less repetitive.
With hopefully some more content and additions operations mode can hopefully reach just a bit more of the potential that it does offer, but still simply just co-op romping with some friends or random allies and curb stomping aliens together are fun solid foundations, hopefully it can just be improved upon.

There's a PVP multiplayer mode where you play as the space marines faction or the Chaos marine (evil hellish marines) faction and fight each other. I haven't played much of it myself but yeah its alright, its there for those who want it.
You can't unfortunately customise the Chaos faction characters, you get premade models for each of the classes on that side, which while they do look cool themselves, does seam like some people are still let down that you can't customise them as well like you can with the space marines.
As far as I've seen theres not many like cool takedowns or anything you can do to enemy players, its just clunky space marines on both sides blasting or thwacking each other clumsily like its a call of duty game and using their ultimate abilities non-stop with no cohesion to see who dies first, then respawning with your abilities charged again to rush back into the fight and repeat the process. Yeah its alright for those who may like the PVP stuff but personally I think the PVE stuff's more the games strong point.

Both the Co-op mode and PVP mode have separate level progressions though so don't think you can level up a class in co-op mode then pop into PVP with a skilled up PVE dude and stomp fools, which is fair BUT however, while class level progression is separate for each mode. You can still unlock cosmetics currency and armour pieces for your characters just by completing matches in both modes as each character. So you can still play both modes and they still count for cosmetic progress at least for each class you beat a match as, so thats nice.

Yeah look, TLDR: Its a decent co-op game and being able to run around and stomp out enemies with allies while playing as giant f*ck off power armoured boys is still awesome. Heck I'm not a big Warhammer series fan myself meaning I knew bugger all about the lore, but I am starting to learn some things about the universe by playing this game and its encouraged me to look a bit more into it.

And you don't need to be a fan of the franchise or know everything to enjoy the game, I'm a simple fella, I saw big mech suits, chainsaws and brutally ripping alien scum to shreads... and thats all I wanted from it.

So its still a solid cool game to play and have fun wreaking havoc on enemies with your big space marine ruthlessness and brutality. But I think it would benefit from some more additions and content, the foundation is there, just build on it and add more levels, and maybe some variety in objectives to keep the co-op mode from becoming stale.

P.S The Season Pass content cosmetics have been a bit disappointing so far, Its just more colours and decals really, I was hoping for more unique/cool and actual standout armour pieces or such to justify its content but so far it leaves alot to be desired IMO.",2024/9/8,en
Therapist Aku,1,20.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CoollizardKaldrogk/,"This game has the feel and vibe of a game made in the late 2000s, early 2010s. The way the multiplayer and the PvE modes play wouldn't be out of place in that era, minus the graphics. This isn't as common nowadays, if at all. So in a weird way, it's a refreshing change that I don't hate at all.

The game currently lacks any microtransactions, and apparently there's no concrete plans for modern microtransaction models. You want new cosmetics? Play the game modes. You want new weapons? Play the game modes. This is good. I like this.

The gameplay feels similar to how the first Space Marine did, with significant improvements in some areas, and a few missteps. The biggest issue comes in the form of the difficulty, as some enemies are just obnoxiously too powerful on their own, with the methods that they swarm you making it all the worse to deal with. This really only is an issue I've found with the Tyranids. The moment you get to your second set of enemies, it's nowhere near as bad.

The gameplay is fun and with the classes and guns available right now there is enough variation to enjoy and keep playing. Where the game does lack though, is the mission content. The re-playable/grind-able missions I feel will get a bit boring after maybe 20-30 hours of grinding them. There is some variation in spawns (elites/bosses can spawn in certain parts of the mission path) but with the few missions that you can run, it isn't enough. Granted the devs plan to expand this later.

There is a PVP mode that will extend the games life a bit but I am yet to try it, although I think it is probably gonna be quite fun.

The game looks beautiful and runs smooth for me (7950x3d, 4090FE, 64gb 6000mhz ram) with the only issue being - when I try to quit the game, it doesn't actually quit. I have to kill it manually.

Overall, id recommend this but if you are only here for the story - wait for it to be expanded with DLC releases or wait for the game to go on a 50% sale. I also got the ultra edition - don't do this unless you just want to support the game, the content it gives you over the Gold isn't really worth it.

Arnold Braunschweiger,1,21,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000162778/,"Fantastic. It’s exactly what you'd expect from a sequel to 2011’s Space Marine and a Warhammer 40K action game. It takes everything that made the first game fun and cranks it up, refining pretty much everything that you remember about that original game.

I never followed the details about the story prior to the release so I wasn't sure if it's gonna pick up from where the last game left off. But I was pleased to see that not only does it still feature Captain Titus as the main character, but also manages to be an overall much better story with a couple of fun memberberries thrown in for fans of the original.

And if you're really invested in the lore, you'll be pleased to know that the developers poured a lot of heart and attention into making this an accurate 40K experience. It's probably the most authentic ""play as a Space Marine"" experience to date, because you truly feel like an eight-foot-tall truck on legs, towering over regular humans and barreling through everything like an elephant in a china shop. Including any living thing that isn't at least as big, because it's going to end up getting stomped like a grape. Everything about this game's design is just as over-the-top, excessive, and ludicrous as you'd expect, and it's glorious.

Mr. Bear,1,45.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/misiok1234/,"This is in my honest opinion the best Warhammer 40k game we've ever had. It does a lot of things very well, and very little outright bad.

The story is good but nothing mind-bending. There's the usual 40k war drama. A few nice twists, and some truly breath catching moments. All of that is if you're a fan of the setting.

If you're not, or yet undecided, then this is a very good entry point. The game does an amazing job showing the scale of conflicts that take place in the universe. Then it impresses you with its visuals and sound design and does not stop.


Things of note, multiplayer (both PVE and PVP) have customization, and the story clocked for me at around 12 hours at the hardest difficulty. Performance seems good enough, though people mention crashing and CPUs going very hot, so keep that in mind.

plandekarz,1,38.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/larshustler/,"Space Marine 2 is easily one of the top games in the Warhammer 40K universe. After 13 long years of waiting since the excellent first game, it was absolutely worth the anticipation. To be completely honest, I got my hands on it early thanks to the leak in July, but since I knew I’d be buying the full version (and went all out for the maximum edition), I think that excuses my impatience. I simply couldn't wait!

Campaign

The sequel’s story picks up directly from the first game, even though about 200 years have passed in the timeline. The campaign is as grand as you’d hope, fitting perfectly within the Warhammer 40K universe. Blood, gruesome executions, and limb-tearing battles define this world, and the game delivers on all fronts. While it’s linear and heavily focused on combat, I found the whole experience a ton of fun.

Combat Mechanics

The combat truly nails the feeling of being an unstoppable, armored giant. From the moment you start the campaign it’s clear that you are super-human. The Ultramarines stand out from the surroundings and look like some sort of Titans, with their sheer size making them equals to the Tyranid warriors. The weight and power of your weapons – both melee and ranged – feel spot on, especially when playing with a controller (I’m using an Xbox one). Each hit, shot, and headshot feels impactful, and those bloody finishing moves? Just perfect.

Co-op Mode

A great addition is the new co-op mode. After the introductory mission, you can jump into the campaign with one or two friends, and it works flawlessly. It really amps up the excitement of playing together. If you're playing solo, the AI companions are excellent, so you won’t feel left out.

Multiplayer

And now for the real treat: multiplayer. If you have fond memories of the multiplayer from the original Space Marine, you’re in for a treat. It was brilliant back then and kept me entertained for hours. Now, after 13 years, we finally have what we’ve been waiting for. The multiplayer alone makes Space Marine 2 worth buying. If you're into the Warhammer 40K universe, there’s no better PvP experience out there.

In my opinion, it’s a solid 10/10. Definitely worth checking out!",2024/9/7,en

Короче, определенно тянет на игру года. Разрабы с вниманием к мелочам подошли к игре и могу сказать, что вышло отлично.
Давно не получал такого удовольствия от геймплея и звуков игры.
Ты чувствуешь, что управляешь 300кг махиной и против тебя сражаются ничуть не менее тяжелые представители местной фауны, а иногда и флоры.

Хорошее музыкальное сопровождение, русская озвучка звучит замечательно, за весь сюжет встретил только один баг с взлетом всех персонажей в воздух, ито пофиксилось перезаходом в игру.
Я не прям задрот вахи и лор знаю поверхностно, но ощущения мира переданы на все сто и каждый чавкающий шаг по тиранидам ощущался каждой клеточкой кожи.

Немного про управление - на геймпаде не пробовал, но с компа надо привыкнуть или поменять под себя.
Лично себе настроил прицел на доп кнопку мыши, тк где-то на клаве его искать не удобно, особенно, учитывая обилие других нужных кнопок для игры.
Уровни сложности ощущаются тоже хорошо. На легком ты машина для убийств, на хардкоре ты космодесантник на последнем задании. Тебя сожрут столько раз, сколько того захочет Император.
Лично я выбрал нормал, тк хотел почувствовать игру, а не боль в промежности, но даже на этом уровне сложности игра бросает вызов.
Друзья у меня бедные, потому играл с ботами и... Они тоже не так плохи, как в условном пейдее.

ping-win,1,66.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ping-win/,"Игра офигенная по геймплею, есть свою нюансы на самом деле, но а целом ощущение положительное.

Плюсы:
1. МЯСО. Бой, добивания, охуенно лайк подписка
2. Сюжет компании - круто, интересно. В целом больше для галочки, но для фанатов зайдет
3. Разные классы - разный геймплей. Классы интересные.
4. Много скиллов на прока,ку, возможность прокачки оружия
5. Графика, оптимизация

Спорно:
1. Как то маловато выбора оружия на класс. Их можно качать, но в компании выбор больше. На самом деле это пока не бесит, но просто хотелось бы

Минусы:
1. Всего 6 PvE миссий, у миссий 4 сложности. На каждую сложность нужен определенный уровень персонажа и оружие чтоб ее вообще пройти. Ты можешь прокачать одного, если захочешь другого - все с нуля. С самой низкой сложности. Надеюсь с длс будет больше миссий.
2. Проблемы с соединением - надеюсь это из за раннего доступа, но тут все плохо. Если стартуешь PvE вдвоем постоянно кидает рандома, который не может подключиться, а ты в это время ждёшь. Потом его выкидывает, идёт отсчёт и коннкетится новый. И так по кругу. С PvP тоже проблемы, иногда зависает Коннект к матчу, приходится alt + f4
3. Миссии компании довольно длинные, сложность в компаниях не имеет смысла кроме как если любишь трайхардить. Плюшек за нее не дают.

Очень надеюсь на сезонный пропуск, в котором добавят больше PvE миссий и возможно новые режимы.

Я предполагал на самом деле что она будет похожа на L4D, и она на нее похожа, но с учётом мяса хотелось бы какой то режим чтобы было похоже на хелдайверс, было бы офигенно если бы можно было тоже какую нибудь поддержку вызвать и бвтвы помасштабнне, это была бы имба",2024/9/7,ru

IppoCho,1,49,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198272332363/,"Après avoir passé plus de 16 h sur le jeu, je pense avoir un avis sur le jeu assez bon, même s’il reste quelques problèmes qui, je l’espère, seront réglés à la sortie ou peut-être via d’autres patchs.

Pour les points positifs : 

– Le gunplay est vraiment satisfaisant : par moment, on a vraiment l'impression d'être invincible jusqu'au moment où l'on tombe sur des mobs d'élite, où l'on doit quasiment envoyer 1 voire 2 chargeurs pour les tuer (ce qui est relativement handicapant quand eu en 5 balles nous met 1/4 life !). Mise à part ça contre les petits mobs ou même les boss, on voit vraiment une utilité à spammer avec son bolter.

– Ensuite, pour ce qui est de l'ambiance, musique, environnement, tout y est, c'est un réel plaisir en tant que fan de la licence de voir un jeu aussi bien fait.

– Une campagne super sympa à faire seul ou avec des amis ! (ce qui serait cool, mais surement impossible à faire, serait de rajouter des campagnes de chaque chapitre/légion mise à l'honneur, comme par exemple pour les Dark Angels qui vont être mis à l'honneur courant cette année, mais je rêve un peu trop).

Maintenant, on va passer au point MID, ce qui est bon, mais qui reste à améliorer : 

– Le système de customisation et de classe ! Alors, pour le coup, je m'attendais à quelque chose de fou quand finalement, je me retrouve devant une customisation assez limitée au début où l'on doit payer avec la monnaie du jeu (que l'on débloque en jouant, pas de soucis à se faire sur ce point-là), mais j'ose imaginer que sur le long terme, la customisation sera incroyable (petite pensée aux fans de Space Marine du chaos qui jetaient leurs larmes pour pleurer sur leur customisation ultra– Les serveurs/classes, je vais les mettre au même niveau parce que les deux sont relativement liés ! ET OUI comme dit dans les bande annonce il y a bien 6 classes mais sur les 6 il n'y en a que facilement 2/3 qui sont jouable sinon le reste poubelle ou presque et surtout comme je l'ai dis les serveurs sont de la partie donc ils suffit qu'il y ai 2 personnes qui veulent jouer la même classe en Opération et la partie ne peut pas se lancer et donc une grande partie des serveurs sont sois bloquer car les 2 classes les plus jouable sont prise mais j'ai bonne espoir que ça sera corriger avant la sortie du jeu 

– Un jeu (pour le moment très important à souligner), pour le moment assez répétitif, c'est-à-dire que vous avez 6 missions avec les mêmes objectifs à chaque fois, de temps en temps des boss qui se rajouteraient, mais pas de quoi casser 3 pattes à un canard. (Après, c'est une avant-première pour le moment, la road map est déjà sortie et il y a 4 saisons déjà prévues, donc que de bon pour le moment, y'a juste à espérer que les chiffres ne casse pas la dynamique, car pour le moment où j'écris ce texte, le jeu est très minimaliste).
Et maintenant les points négatifs à améliorer au plus vite, pitié.

– Le corps à corps ! alors très stylé le système de contre y'a pas a dire mais quand il y a une dizaine d’ennemie qui vous tire dessus et vous frappe disons que c'est assez compliquer de le faire ensuite truc assez bête mais imaginer attaquer un mob élite au corps a corps vous lui mettez 1-2 coups vous charger la troisième il vous envois une attaque qui vous stune et votre combo et complètement stopper sans que vous puissiez rien faire tout en sachant qu'il y a surement 2/3 ennemie autour de vous entrain de vous arracher le gosier d'une puissance jamais vu et la rentre en jeu l'une des deux classe jouable la classe rempart une classe avec un simple pistolet une arme au corps a corps et le saint bouclier qui augmente votre chance de survivre a ce carnage au contact de 10% à un solide 50% (je parle de la game entière évidement) et oui dans se jeu malheureusement il n'y a pas de système de défense simple des esquive ou bien le contre sinon vous subissez et vous pleurez en silence puis sans parler sur système d'attaque en générale qui lock absolument tout et n'importe quoi il y a un systeme de lock pour combattre comme il se doit un ennemie au corps a corps mais comme je l'ai dit en règle générale c'est pas du 1vs1 c'est du 15vs1 donc oubliez les assez vite sauf si vous jouez en pvp la il vous sera peut-être plus utile 

-Enfin pour moi le pire du pire c'est la vie elle disparaît si facilement c'est très très grave comme je l'ai dit plus haut vous allez tomber sur des mob élite qui en règle générale tank pas mal donc vous avez plusieurs option soit vous leurs foncez dessus et vous passez la moitiez de la game sans vie soit vous leurs tirez dessus et vous vous armez de patience et vous  envoyez 2 chargeur se 1 seul mob vont aussi vous allumer en moins d'un chargeur (L'avantage de cette option ce qu'il y a des munition tout les 5 mètres c'est a se demander comment elle se retrouve la par moment) alors que le heal et une précieuse ressource que vous trouverais après avoirs fini votre opération surement c'est tellement rare a trouver que si vous en avez allez jouez au loto vous avez vos chance ! il y a bien un bouclier mais honnêtement c'est juste visuel c'est juste pour dire regarder y'a un bouclier qui est complément inutile donc j'attend pas a avoir des ennemi plus nul non j'attend d'avoir un système de protection parce que quand au corps a corps c'est une orgie tous sur moi avec absolument 0 défense juste une belle épée tronçonneuse qui 2 shoot des petit mob alors imaginer mon état après avoir affronter 3 mobs élites au corps a corps ! Ce qui est dommage, honnêtement, on joue des space marines et je me retrouve à hésiter à affronter 3/4 ploucs qui vont surement tank comme des porcs, donc je ne sais pas : soit il faudrait rendre utile le bouclier, ce qui serait bien, soit peut-être augmenter notre résistance ou soit mettre plus de heal, parce que là, j'ai l'impression de jouer au petit chaperon rouge et je ne suis pas du tout le grand méchant loup.

Bref Beaucoup d’attente sur la suite des choses, en espérant que ça continue pour le mieux et surtout que le jeu fasse une bonne arrivée pour que le monde du jeu vidéo s’intéresse beaucoup plus au lore de Warhammer 40k !",2024/9/7,fr

My only minor complaint, PvP chaos marines not being able to customize their stuff. And Salamanders when you pick their customization the Adeptus Astartes not getting obsidian skin and red eyes. Devs please include it when you pick the Salamanders chapter I presume it shouldn't be hard to implement such thing.

Performance wise it was all right for me I think I just presence 5-6 stutters during my whole gameplay in the campaign and it seems its something related with the green effect from the Tyranids that cause it but I can't pinpoint if is the spores or the psychic effect , my current specs:

★ Kalko,1,55.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DerKalko/,"Brüder und Schwestern des Imperiums, heute betrachten wir ein Werk, das nicht nur ein Spiel, sondern ein Schlachtfeld der Ehre und des Blutes im Dienst des Imperators ist. Space Marine 2 führt uns erneut in die düstere Zukunft des 41. Jahrtausends, wo es nur Krieg gibt – und es macht dies mit solcher Wucht, dass selbst die härtesten Krieger ehrfürchtig zurückweichen könnten.


- Handlung und Atmosphäre – Der ewige Krieg ruft!

Space Marine 2 setzt die Geschichte des Ultramarines Captain Titus fort, dessen unerschütterliche Loyalität gegenüber dem Imperator und der Menschheit im Mittelpunkt steht. Hier zeigt sich die tiefe Verbindung zur düsteren und brutalen Lore des Warhammer 40k-Universums. Die Atmosphäre ist durchzogen von Verzweiflung und Heldenmut. Jeder Schritt auf den Schlachtfeldern – ob auf verseuchten Planeten oder in den schmutzigen Straßen imperialer Städte – schreit nach dem Schrecken des 41. Jahrtausends. Die Bedrohung durch die Tyraniden ist allgegenwärtig, und die Darstellung dieser xenosrischen Albträume ist wahrlich furchterregend. Ihre Horden wogen wie eine lebendige Flut über die Stellungen der Verteidiger hinweg, und das Spiel fängt die schiere Masse und Grausamkeit dieser Kreaturen meisterhaft ein.

Die Geschichte selbst entfaltet sich als epischer Kampf um das Überleben der Menschheit. Captain Titus, geschmiedet im Feuer zahlloser Schlachten, muss nicht nur gegen äußere Feinde kämpfen, sondern auch gegen innere Zweifel. Die Frage, was es wirklich bedeutet, ein Space Marine zu sein – eine unaufhaltsame Tötungsmaschine oder der letzte Verteidiger der Menschheit –, wird immer wieder aufgegriffen. Doch wer Captain Titus kennt, weiß, dass seine Treue unerschütterlich bleibt, und dies macht ihn zu einem wahrhaft legendären Charakter.


- Gameplay – Der Donner des Bolters und das Heulen der Kettenschwerter

Das Gameplay von Space Marine 2 ist wie ein donnernder Hymnus an den Krieg. Das Spiel fängt die Essenz eines Space Marines perfekt ein: Du bist kein gewöhnlicher Soldat – du bist ein wandelnder Panzer, eine lebendige Waffe des Imperators, gemacht um Tausende von Feinden zu vernichten. Das Gefühl der Macht, wenn man den Abzug eines Bolters drückt und sieht, wie Feinde in Blut und Fleisch explodieren, ist unübertroffen.

Das Nahkampfsystem ist eine brutale Symphonie aus Klingen und Fäusten. Die Kettenschwerter brüllen und sägen sich durch die Reihen der Feinde, während die Schläge eines Energiehammers Wellen der Zerstörung durch ganze Formationen senden. Jeder Treffer, jeder Schlag fühlt sich mächtig an, und die audiovisuelle Umsetzung unterstreicht dies perfekt – von den metallischen Klängen der Servorüstung bis hin zu den knirschenden Knochen und reißenden Sehnen der Feinde.

Neu hinzugefügt wurde eine verfeinerte Mechanik für Ausweichmanöver und taktisches Vorankommen. Dies verleiht den Kämpfen eine zusätzliche strategische Ebene, ohne den Fluss des Blutvergießens zu unterbrechen. Besonders beeindruckend ist die Art, wie das Spiel die Zahl der Gegner handhabt – riesige Schwärme von Tyraniden, die auf dich zustürmen, und du allein, ein wandelnder Gott des Krieges, der sie niedermetzelt. Es ist eine brutale, kathartische Erfahrung, die jeden Warhammer-Fan begeistern wird.


- Grafik und Sound – Ein audiovisuelles Meisterwerk

Die Welt von Warhammer 40k wird in Space Marine 2 mit unglaublicher Detailtreue zum Leben erweckt. Die zerklüfteten Schlachtfelder, die gottlosen Alienarchitekturen und die prächtigen Rüstungen der Space Marines – all dies erstrahlt in glorreicher, blutiger Pracht. Besonders hervorzuheben ist die Gestaltung der Tyraniden. Jedes Glied, jede Kralle und jeder zahnbewehrte Schlund dieser abscheulichen Kreaturen wurde mit Liebe zum Detail geschaffen und wirkt wahrhaft furchteinflößend.

Der Soundtrack begleitet die Kämpfe mit düsteren, epischen Klängen, die dem Spieler das Gefühl geben, Teil eines gewaltigen Kreuzzugs zu sein. Die Geräusche des Schlachtfelds – das Rattern der Bolter, das metallische Brüllen der Rüstungen und das markerschütternde Heulen der Tyraniden – sind so intensiv, dass man fast den Schweiß und das Blut riechen kann.


- Fazit – Im Namen des Imperators, es gibt keinen Vergleich

Space Marine 2 ist nicht nur ein Spiel, sondern eine Erfahrung. Es fängt die Essenz dessen ein, was es bedeutet, ein Space Marine zu sein: ein Krieger, der in einem Universum voller Tod und Chaos kämpft und niemals zurückweicht. Die Mischung aus intensiven, brutalen Kämpfen, der düsteren, tiefgründigen Geschichte und der atemberaubenden audiovisuellen Präsentation macht es zu einem Muss für jeden Fan des Warhammer 40k-Universums – und für jeden, der den Imperator ehren will.

Dieses Spiel ist ein Monument des Krieges, errichtet auf dem Blut und den Knochen der Feinde des Imperators.

Für den Imperator! Für das Imperium! Kein Bedauern, kein Rückzug, nur Sieg!

BB910,1,14.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BB910/,"Oyunu genel olarak çok beğendim ancak şikayetimin olduğu bir kaç nokta var. Birincisi, oyunun yakın dövüş mekaniklerini iyi yaptıkları için sürekli yakın dövüşe girmenize zorlanmanız. Ne alaka diyebilirsiniz şöyle açıklayayım. Canınızın çok az kaldığı ve merminizin de neredeyse bittiği bir an düşünün, karşınızda daha sürüyle düşman var. Koşarak biraz mesafe açmak istiyorsunuz ama yapamıyorsunuz. Çünkü yaratıklar sizden çok daha hızlı ve aralıksız olarak spamlarcasına üstünüze zıplıyorlar. Siz de isteseniz de istemeseniz de yakın dövüşe girmek zorunda kalıyorsunuz çünkü koşarak kaçmaya çalışırsanız %100 öleceksiniz. Böyle sürüyle yaratık öldürdüğünüz bir oyunda düşmanla birazcık mesafemi açıp sonra geri dönüp tekrardan taramaya başlamak istiyorum ve bunu yapamıyorum. Tamam bir saf shooter oyununa göre inanılmaz derinlikli bir yakın dövüş mekaniğiniz var ama kullanmak da zorunda değilim. Zaten farklı tarzlarda oynansın diye 6 farklı class koymuşsunuz. Bırakın isteyen uzaktan sıksın isteyen yakından girsin. Bu uzaktan bakınca saçma bir şikayet gibi görünebilir ancak oyunu normal zorluğun üstüne alıp, iletişim kurduğunuz bir arkadaşınız olmadan oynadığınız zaman dediğimi çok net bir şekilde anlayacaksınız. Bazı noktalar gerçekten hayatta kalmak imkansız hale geliyor çünkü ve oyunun tadı kaçıyor.

İkinci şikayetim de tamamen çıkmış bir oyuna göre az içerik olması. Bu oyunda ana hikaye dışında online olarak oynayacağınız görevler ve bir sürü geliştirme imkanı olan 6 farklı class, üstüne her silahın kendi geliştirmesi var. Ancak oyunda sadece 6 görev var. Evet 6. Ve hiçbiri de o kadar da uzun değil. İleride illaki görev eklenecektir ama yine de başlangıç için çok az. Bu bir erken erişim oyunu olsa anlarım ama şu anda pek anlayabildiğim bir durum değil bu. Karakter geliştirmek falan da o kadar çabuk yapabileceğiniz bir şey değil. Bir classı fullemek baya zaman alıcak gibi duruyo oynadığım kadarıyla. O yüzden acilen yeni görevler eklenmesi lazım. Ayrıca silah çeşitliliği de az ve hali hazırda bulunan silahların bazıları birbirine çok benziyor. Mesela bir silahın normal, dürbünlü veya altında bomba atar olan versiyonu var. Bunlar 3 silah olarak ayrılmış. Biraz çakallık gibi geldi ama neyse ileride umarım çeşitlenir oyun.",2024/9/6,tr

After finishing the campaign I just had to write a review to get my thoughts down on paper, this review will contain no spoilers for the story, but will talk about themes, gameplay and performance. Together of course with an overall impression, to start things off.

Space Marine 2 exceeded my expectations by a significant margin, this game is fun to play. I've seen some other reviews talking about how the combat system is ""unforgiving"", but I can only say that I disagree. The fast paces melee / ranged blend is really satisfying once you figure out what works for you. I played the game on the second to highest difficulty for my first run so far, I had to adjust in the beginning but once I got over the hurdle, quite frankly I just saw myself improving and getting better at managing the fights. To an extent fights in this game feel reminiscent of those from DOOM, specifically Eternal. Every fight is a puzzle that you need to think creatively to solve together with staying on top of incoming attacks and positioning.

Complaints about the AI are valid, but I didn't notice much in terms of them getting in the way of me having fun.

Performance wise, I'm running on a fairly old rig, 1080 and an i7-4790k, and I got stable performance albeit not exceptional on the high preset. For me I am fine if a game runs at 30 as long as it is stable, and Space Marine 2 was, depending on level, either running at stable 30, stable 45, stable 60 or unstable 20-30. The 20-30 range being in some of the later where the game is flexing it's muscle in terms of scale and the number of effects on screen.

As for all the stuff with the Epic integration? Quite literally you accept the EULA and that's it. It has no other impact on your gameplay. I find complaints around this sort of stuff to be valid, if exaggerated. It is okay to be upset that this is ""forced"" upon you, but I do not think it warrants leaving a negative review for the game, personally.

Story? This feels like it could've been a 40k novel. I say that with significant praise, compared to the first game the stakes are higher, the characters are better, and it just feels like a part of actual canon now.

I am incredibly satisfied, and depending on how the game develops in the next few years, it might take the spot for ""My personal favorite 40k game"", as it is now, however? Firmly top 3.

Suffice to say, I strongly recommend this game, I will be diving into the multiplayer and co-op components in the next few days, and if there is anything to add or detract from this review, expect addenda :)

If no addenda are found on this review, my stance holds firm.",2024/9/6,en

Garviel Loken,1,275.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046775834/,"К данной игре будет весьма занятный обзор, ведь я её ждал и хотел получить удовольствие от игрового процесса, но пока получил только кучу лишнего горения.

Пожалуй, стоит для начала отметить плюсы игры:
1) Несомненно внимание к деталям. Атмосфера просто поражает глаз. Очень красивые декорации.
2) Подходящее звуковое сопровождение, да такое, что иногда хочется задержаться на пару мгновений на стартовом экране меню игры.
3) Противники - Тираниды реально ощущаются невообразимым стадом саранчи, просто полчища. Чуть засмотрелся и тебя уже не просто окружили, но еще и высушили.

Теперь поехали по минусам и этапам горения, конкретно в моём случае:
1) Почему купив версию с ранним доступом, я чувствую себя участником Бетатеста? Началось с того, что загрузить игру было невозможно в стиме, хотя кто-то уже катал в неё и не первый час.
2)Почему, при первом запуске я должен танцевать с бубном и угадывать причину краша на экране? Первая сюжетная катсцена, лица Кадианцев и всё, писос, приехали. Обновление драйверов и биоса не дало результатов. Проблема та же. После очередного запуска, каким-то макаром удалось дождаться отклика от программы, прослушать до конца ролик вступительный и приступить к игре...
3)ОШИБКА СЕТЕВОГО ПОДКЛЮЧЕНИЯ. Ну ёкарный бабай. За что? Император не любит меня? Почему кто-то спокойно катает в коопе, а у кого-то стабильное подключение только в меню игры, а при запуске миссии выкидывает в оффлайн режим? К другу соответственно ты тоже не подключишься. Проверил Брэндмауэр - все разрешения выставлены. Так же пробовал отключать и включать кроссплатформу - безрезультатно.
07.09.2024
✅Проблема подключения решена изменением настройки часового пояса и региональных настроек. (Нужно выставить свой часовой пояс в настройках -Панель управления - Дата и Время - Изменить часовой пояс (ставим свой часовой пояс)
И - Пуск - Параметры - Дата и время - поставить галочку на автоматическое определение.

4) Явное отсутствие баланса в ПВЕ режиме с ботами. Запустил первую миссию, выбрал класс Bulwark (Щитоносец) и был приятно удивлен тем ЩИТОМ, который происходил. Два бота, собрата примариса просто офигивали превозмогать в каждой большой волне, ведь появлялись два летающих моба, кастующих зеленые шары. У выбранного щитоносца тупо нехватает боезапаса, что-бы сбить с них защиту или убить с помощью плазменного пистолета. Боезапаса на карте крайне мало, и если уйдёшь дальше. чем нужно - может появится новая волна мобов, которая сделает тебе габельную катку в попытке найти больше патронов. Кто то скажет -""Дурень, щитовик милишник, а не дальний бой"" и будет прав. НО, превозмагать с ботами и ждать, пока они минут за 5-7 уберут двух таких мобов - то еще приключение, потому что ты постоянно должен уворачиваться от летящих сфер, что-бы не потерять лица. Режим контратак иногда плохо ощущается. может из-за мешающих, огромных индикаторов на целях. В общем удовольствия от мили сражений практически не получил.

P.S.
Обзор можно будет изменить на положительный, когда хотя бы часть проблем уйдёт.

El apartado gráfico es de 10 solido, todo cargado de detalles, efectos y una iluminación magnifica, el curro que tiene detrás es espectacular.
Sonido perfecto, acorde con lo que podrías escuchar en cualquiera de las películas de WH40K, es decir, temas ominosos y épicos todo ello acompañado con una gran calidad de sonido de efectos como disparos, enemigos y explosiones.
Quiero destacar el doblaje, tiene 1 único detalle que no me entusiasmó, por algun motivo dicen ""imperium"" en vez de imperio, no es un gran trauma, pero me pareció raro, pero por lo demás muy buena calidad de voces y algo muy chulo, es que puedes cambiar a cualquier idioma disponible en el acto, sin pantallas de carga, lo que te permite, por ejemplo, jugar un rato escuchando el juego en Japones y volver al inicial enseguida.
La historia a la altura del Space Marine 1 pero x4, con buenos personajes y grandes momentos, no busca plantearte nada trascencental, solo que disfrutes del viaje, jugar al 1 es necesario, pero no obligatorio, ya que los detalles que se nombran te los explican durante la historia.
Temas de rendimiento, el caso es que mi poco añejo portatil se lo ha soleado, por lo que 0 problemas, pero seguramente dará algun que otro quebradero de cabeza en equipos más modestos porque ya solo con la cantidad de partículas que tiene tendrás que ser honesto con la cfg por más que duela.
Y alguna cosa más que se me ocurrirá cuando descanse un poco jeje. En resumen, Si te gusta WH40K, este juego es lo que necesitabas aunque no lo supieras ;)

- do grania na dual sense najlepiej wyłaczyc steam input (steam sugeruje to na początku ale patrząc na niektóre komentarze do nie wszystkich to dotarło.

With Space Marine II, Saber interactive proves, once again, that they know how to do action games, this time adding a ton of Co-op & PvP options powered by their squeaky-clean net code. The game runs excellently, looking great and performing to specification. I was able to stream it from the same rig I was playing on, and only got one random crash during my five-hour session. Visuals are great, audio is fantastic, and the writing found here is far better than any game in the genre usually gets. The Swarm Engine that made WWZ what it is comes into play and provides a breathtaking sense of scale to most encounters. The price-tag might be a bit steep, at least when we are talking about the Early Access Versions, but they come packed with the first Season Pass, which will eventually make the investment worth it. If you are looking for a really well-crafted action games to play with your friends, will not disappoint. To War!

You bet your sweet ass I did. I cannot express what an amazing experience this was as a 40K fan, I haven't touched anything except the story, just finished it in fact, and I was completely blown away. The scale of the set pieces, fan service galore, and all of the Tyranids and Chaos Servants you can ea- um, annihilate, I can feel the love that the devs put into this masterpiece coming inside me.

If you're a fan of 40K, and you liked the original Space Marine game, or you like hack and slash 3PS games, you need to pick this up. This was a labor of love that we may never see again if these f*cking morons leaving negative reviews have their way.

Some sound mixing issues, very few physics based glitches, and absolutely fantastic performance with TWO, COUNT EM TWO hitches in the framerate in my entire playthrough due to I'm guessing shader compilations. This is the most polished game I played in 2024.

Anyone leaving negative reviews for this game because of the Epic stuff? You're a pathetic POS. You will never be able to use Epic Games anything without accepting their TOS, so how the ever living F*CK are you going to sue them? You're apparently not using their products anyways, troglodytes.

Скажу сразу игра довольно хорошая, нет даже отличная. Достойное продолжение первой Space Marine.
И хочу отдать должное Relic Entertainment, ведь эта студия ""заложила основу"" серии.
Так же хочу поблагодарить студию Saber Interactive за ""качественный"" продукт. И довольно неплохой сюжет (хотя честно он коротковат по сравнению с первой частью(чисто мое мнение)).
Боевая система довольно динамичная (даже очень, хочется немного ""старой"")
Окружение вообще бомба, чувствуется ""размах и эпичность""
Поставлю игре 8,5 из 10 (Тит не ""зачитывает мысль дня"" , к динамике боя надо привыкать)
И последнее я прошу, нет умоляю чтобы Saber Interactive сделала ремастер первой Space Marine!!

Well, this is my first review.
I'll say right away that the game is quite good, no, even excellent. A worthy continuation of the first Space Marine.
And I want to give credit to Relic Entertainment, because this studio ""laid the foundation"" of the series.
I also want to thank the Saber Interactive studio for a ""quality"" product. And a pretty good plot (although honestly it is short compared to the first part (purely my opinion)).
The combat system is quite dynamic (even very much, I want a little ""old"")
The environment is generally the bomb, you feel the ""scope and epicness""
I'll give the game 8.5 out of 10 (Titus does not ""read out the thought of the day"", you need to get used to the dynamics of the battle)

LeGurmuX,0,11.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/legurmux/,"The game has immersive and astonishing visuals and gets really the wonder of the Warhammer 40k universe grandeur and epic proportions. This can definitely give some inspiration and feel of ave to anyone really interested in the 40k universe.

The gameplay is quite a copy from Warhammer 40k Darktide, in all aspects of level design, weapon design, visuals. Unfortunately this also mean the gameplay, weapons design and level design and enemies are as they were in Darktide. This game however is not some aspiring storm trooper learning to survive, but this is a game where the player is put into the boots of a Space Marine, as super soldier with genetic and technological superiority, an Emperor's angel that alone can take tides of baddies etc.

The problems are soon too apparent and disturb severely the feel given to the player. Weapons have extreme recoil, they have too low damage and too low range and in many cases even too low ammo capacity. You get the feel of being scared, alone, restricted... Not the feeling of being the best there is going with brave heart towards what might look as if being suicidal odds and still expect to come out as unscratched and victorious. The devs should at least to a minimum add the target enhancing and dark vision to be constant things for the Space Marines, not some random and seldom few second bonuses. Also while at it the recoil should mostly go away as the guys here do have the power armour of the best sort and the usual recoil from heavy weapons is nothing to these guys. More over the also have Auspex inbuilt to their helmets, super senses, dark vision, automatic sensor arrays around them etc. This should give them really good combat awareness at all times and extreme accuracy with any weapons. The weapons are also needing to get some sort of a update... It feels so sad to fire a large caliber bolter at some hormagaunt to only see that it fights on and did not even lose a limb or so, and this happens with EVERY round... It get so annoyingly sad too soon... For some reason they also chose not to copy the sound from Darktide, and bolters, chain swords, power swords etc. all sound so lame (which unfortunaly is also lame in effects too)... These Space Marines should be able to kill things with far more less effort than the game makes you do especially if trying anything but the Easy mode. Also the Space Marine power armour is merely more resilient than the health and life points in Darktide making the player die and suffer in situations that are barely seeming dangerous.

Please devs, make the above fixes to the gameplay and also add much more damage to every marine weapon and especially the Heavy Bolter, Plasma Pistol, Plasma Gun, and Meltagun all need to feel like they are some weapons of mass destruction even against bosses. Just allow us feel like god-like super soldiers and not some decent elite commando guys... Make the armour withstand things much more... Currently the tolerance is just pathetic... And while at it, get rid of the dodge roll animation finally... Just allow the super soldier to take a quick leap of some two meters or so worth... The super quick dodge roll in a 300kg armour just really is like a bad bad thing for the immersion. Movent which btw is otherwise very nicely done to give the character some very heavy feel otherwise with all the noises and thumps and slight slowness. It would also be nice if you devs could get some effects where the enemies lose limbs and weapons while being shot at and losing capability to attack or move along. This way you can still allow the enemies to withstand occasionally some bolt or two extra. MAybe also make the enemies have some weak points where they are wounded heavily with shots instead of just being hp reduction thing for them. Though the melee blocking and execution shots are very nice.

The game has been developed as being another Darktide with different skin and seems like the devs wanted the main game to be the multiplayer deathmatch / team match thing instead of the campaign where you go against tyranids... If wanting to get a feel of being a Space Marine among a tyranid invasion, this is not so much of a giving the feeling, but just baing visually very immersive 40k thingy then,",2024/9/6,en
