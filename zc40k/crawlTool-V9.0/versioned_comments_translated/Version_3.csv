GrizzlyOne95,1,13.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GrizzlyOne95/,"I know absolutely nothing about Warhammer, and never played the games before, but when I saw a big beefy boi ripping aliens into shreds, I was intrigued.

Anyway, this game was great. Played the campaign partially solo and partially coop. Melee is very satisfying and fun. The shooting is also nice but usually feels pretty ineffective given the lower ammo capacity of most guns. The first moment of the game where you see a huge swarm running at you is terrifying but also exhilarating.

I will say the first half of the game was my favorite, as the other enemies later on don't seem quite as fun to fight, but it was still enjoyable. I never skipped a cutscene, as they were really drawing me in even with no knowledge of the universe. The world building, overall art direction and scenery is just impeccable, and I probably spent upwards of 30+ minutes just staring at the vistas.

Haven't even tried the coop missions or MP yet, but I can say this game was super well done and really fun.",2024/10/4,en
Godbrithil,1,21.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Godbrithil/,"After over a decade of anticipation, countless prayers and occasional cursing, Titus has finally put on his iconic armor again-ready to make alien hordes out.But the question remains: Is it the long -awaited triumph that we have been waiting for?Or just another digitized bloodbath without brain and heart?We snapped St. Bolter and plunged into the battle.


As soon as you started the game, there is no time for gentle introduction or profound philosophical conversations.Instead, you get a thick bolt in your hand and are thrown into an army of Tyranids.The hero of our history, Captain Titus, is the epitome of the Space Marine cliché: indestructible, cynical and with the moral empathy of a chain sword.Not long is torched here - as if a bulldozer drives against a horde of anger - ruthless, tremendous and 100% satisfactory.The feeling when your chain sword drives into a group of aliens is pure balm for which soul strained by everyday life.Strategic depth?Forget it!You are not a chess master, you are a war instrument, and your only tactic is: destroy everything in sight.The small subtle introduction is by no means too short or later.


The story of Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 is as epic and profound as a motivational poster in an office: it is there, but actually none is interested.Captain Titus returns, and with him the old wisdom that words may be powerful, but cannot do anything against a well-placed Bolter Salve.The tyranids eat whole worlds, the imperator is silent as always, and Titus does what he can best do: smash everything that does not look imperial or Xenos.Deep character development?None.But there is a lot on the twelve - and frankly, that's exactly the kind of storytelling that we deserve.For everything else, there is the books.[/H1]


What could be nicer than shooting a Horde Xenos into pieces?Exactly - to do the whole thing with friends.Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 provides us with a Coop mode that does not swing big speeches, but throws you and your buddies directly into the battle.This is not about sophisticated tactics or clever interaction - it's about who is the first to ""for the imperator!""Shouts while he ballet his bolter.Fun aside: With two wisen friends or randoms, you rush into missions that are designed to promote teamwork - at least in this respect that you will revive each other when one of the comrades in the heat of the moment blesses the time.My personal recommendation: plays the Coop on the level of difficulty ""Angel of Death"" (campaign) or ""merciless"" (PVE), because only there does the real fun and the brutal authenticity of the shared slaughter come into its own.


Not a shameless cash shop that wants to pull your money out of your pocket while you are dismantling aliens.Space Marine 2 dispenses with microtransactions, booster or any payment models that give you the feeling that you only take part in the battlefield if you do not make a lot of coal.There is only one thing to do here: killing and celebrating victories.












Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 is not for delicacies.It is a game that does not indulge in any illusions and instead offers you exactly what it promises: merciless, brutal and, above all, entertaining destruction.It is as if someone had thrown Doom, Gears of War and the dark 40k world into a blender and accidentally pressed the button for ""epic"".So if you are looking for a game that you don't have to think about, but just want to sow death and ruin - welcome.But do not forget to call ""lead the imperator"".

Here is a short and nice video, which describes the game in detail (Attention Spoiler):",2024/10/7,de
Trevor Reznik,1,12.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/trevor_reznik/,"You are essentially a walking tank, but you fight with the grace of a ballerina. This game renders many hundreds of enemies on screen but still manages to run well. Gameplay is fun and addicting. This is everything I want from a game in 2024: to feel like it released back in 2006, while looking even better.",2024/10/6,en
ViMartian,1,12.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086840425/,"At first glance, in Space Marin 2 there is nothing innovative, uncomplicated gameplay, mechanics, as in many games before, a simple plot, corridor of locations, scarcity in the choice of weapons.
However, when I started playing, I experienced indescribable emotions.
The game has gorgeous to goosebumps with Gothic surroundings and gigantism, the elaboration of small details, spectacular battles.
The game managed to convey the amazing atmosphere of the universe, the state of the eternal struggle, a nagging sense of hopelessness, when you see the roller gigantic waves of enemies, but at the same time the stamina of the cosmodesters, the courage of the imperial guard and the overcoming of all difficulties.
It turned out that now it was precisely the following: a short -term plot campaign does not have time to get bored, corridor Loki concentrates on missions, fights the battles, and a simple plot gives rest from the variables of the variable endings of some games.It turned out that a large selection of weapons, in fact, is not needed, a cosmessor with a bolt screw and a chain sword-this is organic and quite enough)
As a result, the Space of Marina2 impressed me with their atmosphere that I became interested in the history of Wahi and began to read books in the universe.
I recommend this game, because, perhaps, someone else it will inspire me for immersion in the ENT of the world Varhammer 40k.

And yes, now I know all the primarchs by heart ...)))",2024/10/8,ru

Whalen147,1,3.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/whalen147/,"New patch did indeed fix issues on Linux and steam deck, so I can recommend the game again.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Devs have said that the next patch should fix the issue for Linux and SteamDeck users. Once the patch rolls out and it’s confirmed that it does fix the issue, I can recommend the game again.

As of Patch 3.0, users on linux are unable to play online. It appears to be intentional, as the linux64 EAC binary is no longer published in the modules CDN. Just straight up turned off the linux support checkbox.",2024/9/28,en
McGregor,1,478.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199753875974/,"A fantastic game bringing back all the memories of couch co-op from the early aughts. With lavish attention to detail and lore accuracy, Space Marine 2 sets a new bar for the Warhammer franchise.

Combat captures all the crunchy melee and weighty ranged weapon feel you'd expect from the 41st millennium. While feeling clunky at first, the gameplay soon becomes a fluid dance as you begin to understand the parry, dodge and gun strike mechanics culminating in a wide array of gory executions. Harder difficulties will provide challenge and invoke some truly triumphant moments for your three man squad.

The campaign is a relatively linear but satisfying romp with some great set pieces and characters that provide a basic depth making completion satisfying.

Operations, where you will likely spend most of your time, has only 6 missions (for now) but the great combat loop and AI director keep you engaged long after multiple replays should begin to feel stale.

6v6 multiplayer has a solid foundation with well designed maps and a decent paper-rock-scissors class system.

If you're a Warhammer fan, Space Marine 2 is a must buy. If you're new to the universe, you'll likely be drawn into the grim dark future where there is only war.",2024/10/3,en

Positively Cynical,0,11,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Positively_Cynical/,"The game worked on Linux from launch up to the latest patch, which has made online play impossible. They have since changed Linux to unsupported on the product page and have emailed via their support tickets a mix of messages that the game will not be supported on linux and/or that they're aware of and attempting to fix the issue; so not even their support staff are aware of what's going on in any cohesive capacity.

The devs themselves have said full steam deck (inherent linux support) is coming by end of year on their website, and to reiterate, it worked fine and dandy at launch on linux machines.

I as well as most others who purchased the game with intent to play on Linux have likely exceeded the 2 hour playtime at this point and are denied refund requests despite the game no longer being playable, so no refunds and no concrete official statements of any kind from the developer as of this review's posting.",2024/10/2,en
Necroel,1,77.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073250689/,"Even if you are not a fan of the Warhammer universe, but you like third -person shooters, then passing ""Space Marine 2"" is strictly prohibited.Especially if you once waited very hard and that unappropriate ""Starcraft: Ghost"" from Blizzard Entertainment in the hope of turning a groove into minced meat.Even the fans of the Soulslick Games will be pleasantly surprised, becauseAt high levels of complexity, the game turns into a literal sense of the word nightmare (in the best sense of the word).

If you want a bloody action with harsh men shooting hundreds of hungry creatures from the depths of space, then take it without hesitation.You do not have to clean the “outposts” for hundreds of hours as in “other” games or to see the disgusting agenda of Sweet Baby Inc.The epic campaign will take you no more than 10 hours, and then you can enjoy the destruction of tyranids in operations, alone or with friends.

Ryultima,1,86.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KGRYU/,"From the first minutes, the game captures the brutal and epic essence of the Warhammer 40K universe.The graphics are breathtaking, every detail of the armor of the Space Marines and the Xenos hordes is rendered with impressive precision.The fights are intense, skillfully mixing shot and melee, and each confrontation against the tyrants is a deadly dance where the slightest error can be fatal.

The story is rich and immersive, faithfully respecting the Lore established while introducing new captivating elements.Dialogues and interactions with other characters strengthen immersion, constantly reminding us of the sacrifices and the duty of the Space Marines towards the Imperium of humanity.

But what really distinguishes Space Marine 2 is its atmosphere.We really feel the pressure and urgency of each mission, the camaraderie between brothers in arms, and the unshakable determination of Titus in the face of adversity.The soundtrack, epic and martial, perfectly accompanies each moment of glory and despair.

In conclusion, Space Marine 2 is not only a game, it is an experience.A dive into a dark and fascinating universe where each victory is torn from the price of blood and courage.For the Emperor and the Imperium, I recommend this game to all Warhammer 40K fans and to those looking for an unforgettable adventure.",2024/10/1,fr

III_DarkAngel,0,12,https://steamcommunity.com/id/III_DarkAngel/,"This is another one of those games where I really wish there was a neutral option for Steam reviews.

My review is based off of a solo campaign completed on veteran difficulty, all operations completed and a decent amount of multiplayer.

Space Marine 2 is a large step up from it's predecessor and improves on almost every aspect of graphics and gameplay. The controls are familiar to anybody who's played games that require timing and elevated awareness. At the beginning it stays true to the lore to a point but quickly starts to suffer from ""main character syndrome"" as the story progresses. The multiplayer offering is interesting but not enough to keep me coming back for any length of time.

I understand the hype surrounding the title but I can't really get my head around why nobody is discussing the game's very obvious shortcomings, at least in my opinion.

The longer I played the story the more I started to realise that the structure of almost every single mission is identical to the last. The layout of almost every mission is as follows; Begin after a short cutscene, run through a linear level and kill groups of enemies, eventually you'll hit a large area which is handcrafted to show off the games ""swarm engine"" which is basically a point defence for a couple of minutes which was painfully obvious that it was ripped straight out of World War Z (especially the enemies climbing on top of one another to reach you at the top of a high wall and the whole 'hitting the base of the tower to make them collapse mechanic'). You proceed to the end then watch another short cutscene, rinse and repeat for between 8-10 hours. Pretty much the entire bulk of Space Marine 2 is defend this objective, defend that objective, defend the next objective or fight a boss in a small arena area. Another section it shamelessly ripped off from another game was the dodging debris left and right as you thrust around the screen identical to Dead Space 2 and 3. During the campaign you unlock six side-missions known as Operations which take place alongside Damocles Squad in the timeline of the main story, this is also something I couldn't quite understand, this mode has decent amounts of customisation, skill trees, weapon trees, currencies and unlock paths... to play on only 6 short missions with no variation, hmm. I played all of these once and seen no reason to come back to play them again since I knew the story and what to expect, I also found that progression does not carry over into your campaign character so I was really trying to find out what the purpose of this mode actually was, jury is still out on that one.

The multiplayer isn't something I'm really going to comment on because some people love it in games, others just don't bother with it, I'm of the latter.

Overall the story was... okay. The characters are well voiced and interesting in their own respects until you realise that literally half of the campaign is just your squad mates bickering back and forth about how much of a traitor you are, which in the grand scheme of things makes sense but after hours of hearing it I just began to get irritated and closed off from it. Toward the end of the story there is so much plot armour and so much main character syndrome I just ended up sighing when the credits rolled, feeling more bored than accomplished.

Just a side note before closing; I'm curious why instead of taking part in these epic final battles toward the end and physically fighting my way through, I was instead forced to sit and watch a handful of short cutscenes, one even held my hand and forced me to move in a certain way in order to progress while I literally just sat back and watched my character move on his own. Strange, it's almost like they were trying to rush through it to finish the game in time but I could be wrong.

In summary, I think that Space Marine 2 is a visually impressive title and should definitely be commended for bringing the Warhammer 40K universe to life in the way that it does but for me personally it simply doesn't bring enough to keep me interested for any length of time and once the story is completed and all the operations the only replayability I found was in the multiplayer which personally I have no interest in myself.

Ultimately it verges into a not recommended from me with all the negative points considered, if I could give neutral reviews, I would for this one.",2024/9/30,en

✞ImKingJawn✞,0,62.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ImKingJawn/,"I cannot fathom in any way shape or form that Focus would decide that the game is entirely too easy. It comes as a very odd notion when you are constantly fighting an uphill battle for Armory Data, to become stronger, to make things easier. The entire premise of the games progression for operations was to complete operations, become stronger, and steamroll. What is the purpose of the entire progression system if the devs want to pull the rug out from beneath you? There genuinely isn't a good reason to have the entire progression system there in order to become stronger, just for the developers to decide that it's ""too easy"" and nerf everything. Genuinely the only people this system hurts is newer, non maxed out players. Because everyone with the maxed out weapons, perk trees, and levels already have the experience required to interchange their loadouts to make the game easier. It appalls me that a powerfantasy PVE game didn't see how these changes ruined Helldivers to a nigh irreparable state. Nerfing the Melta bomb, by SEVENTY PERCENT against the one boss people like saving it for? Ridiculous. Sure, some people on Youtube made it one-shot the Hive Tyrant. That doesn't mean that everyone plays like that. The fun thing about Space Marine 2 is build variety, and the more you nerf certain things the more that is taken away. To return to my former statement about Helldivers, that exact thing is what killed the game for me. I can't enjoy the game where I feel pressured to play the exact same way as everyone else because that is manageable and the way I like playing isn't.

Dewrill,0,65.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DocDewrill/,"for me, while i do enjoy the game, its gonna be a Thumbs down.
i pretty much exclusively play the operations Mode, as i did the Hordemode in SM1.
and i do not like where the Patch Trend is going.

right now you require Armory Data (upgrade item) from Difficulty 3 and 4 if you wish to Upgrade your weapon and/or Advance the weapons Perktree.
so if you struggle on Dif. 2, you have to fight through an EVEN HARDER mission(Dif3) to upgrade your weapon to a point where you can enjoy Dif.2

the Perktree has the same issue, you need to unlock and max out each weapon in the Weaponclass to max out the Perks related tot he weapon. some of them completely altering attacks (Combat Knife) or adding additional Attacks (Thunder Hammer)
so to enjoy the weapon to the fullest you are forced to play a Dif you may not enjoy.

with Patch 3 they adjusted the Difficulty in a good way. Patch 3 made the Assault Class playable for non-sweaty people. i greatly appriciated that. but Patch for went in the other direction, including such sentences as ""too easy"" from the Devs.

that sounds like this game will not develop in a direction i will enjoy.
and until i see a different trajectory i will leave this as a ""Not recommended"" review.

Very typical European and American movies, anyway, the protagonist is the most correct,
The requirements of the protagonist can solve the problem that the problem is not so much.
Then Uncle Hei was decent, and the teammates of the white back were uncomfortable.












In terms of gaming, you can only say that it is still possible,
Different melee weapons have different attack modules, and there are many long -range weapons to choose from, and the execution is quite handsome.
In addition, the guidance is very good, and there is no egg pain and decryption.
If the battle can accept it, it is basically playing the whole process.
(But the location of the archive is relatively strange ...
It is best to enter the branch mission campaign at the beginning when you are on the spacecraft.
The main line dialogue until half, otherwise, otherwise the main line of this chapter can only start from scratch)
The rest are some bugs, inexplicably dropped the frame, the enemy suddenly disappeared, and the program suddenly stuck to pop up.
There are also some levels, for example, the level that needs to use a flame injection is particularly uncomfortable.
There is no feeling that the fire spray on the enemy at all ...
These problems will affect the experience, and there are many situations encountered.

Then there is music and sound effects,
This personally thinks it is really not too good ...
The sound effect itself is actually okay, but sometimes the big voice is not big, and the sense of disobedience is a bit strong.
However, some music often contains some strange drum sound roar, which will be mixed with the sound effects during the battle.
Plus the time when all kinds of voices are large = =
As a result, when voice, music, and sound effects are mixed together, when they are mixed together,
It often gives people a particularly messy feeling (maybe it is because I did not open the reason for British?)
It's a rare game that I want to deduct points because of the sound experience ...

Khaio,1,19.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Khaio/,"Analysis totally focused on the game campaign!

This game is a work that goes beyond being just a shooting game set in space.Upon entering the skin of one of the most feared and respected warriors of the Empire, I felt throughout the game the fervor that transcends the simple act of fighting.The game made me feel like it's in a true crusade, in the name of humanity, evoking a feeling of patriotism and an innate desire to fight and die for the struggle!

The experience was especially impactful not only for the visceral and brutal gameplay (which you all know has been very rare today, having only Helldivers 2 presented something similar lately), but for the strong bond that develops between the protagonist and the NPCs that thatThey are part of their squad, which are really as heroes as the protagonist, not just limited to secondary characters who watch the protagonist do everything.Even though it is the main focus of the narrative, the intensity with which the NPCs fought by my side is as large as mine.The shouts of war, their demonstrations of loyalty and courage in combat, and the way they sacrifice themselves without hesitation create an unshakable atmosphere that emerged a lot within the game.At many times, I was not just like the hero, but as a small part of something larger - a fraternity of warriors united by a common purpose: to protect humanity at any cost.

Space Marines are not ordinary characters, and the game portrays it impressively.Each is a force of nature, not just in terms of skills, but in the way they completely surrender to combat and mission.This aspect is particularly powerful because it made me feel that the responsibility of victory was not just about my shoulders, but it was shared with each soldier around me.Their fury before decisive battles, and the relentless and infinite will to continue fighting, even in the face of insane adversities, made me feel that I was part of a much larger cause than myself.

Leaving aside what touched me most emotion in this game, now I speak of the detailed graphics that also helped amplify these emotions.Each scenario was certainly very beautiful (he took many prints throughout the phases), from the worlds devastated by war to the dark corridors of the enemy fortresses.

The combination of these elements created an experience that I haven't had been in a long time, and I believe many here understand that they haven't felt for a long time, that it is the urge to play something all day, like every minute, and when it is over, we are ""already""he finished?"".",2024/10/15,pt

[IF-CM] Evoke,0,85.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IF-CM-Evoke/,"A month has passed since the release of Space Marine 2, so now there is an opportunity to express your thoughts about the game, based on the experience gained, and not on a general hype.
First of all, on behalf of the oldest Order of Imperial Fists, I want to express a great gratitude for the developers for the new breath, which they gave all the Warhammer40k fans, taking up the creation of Space Marine 2 and, more importantly, bringing the matter to the release.I’ll take the courage to say that other clans - both veterans and completely newcomers - are inspired by the work done.

Many clans decided to devote a long time to the game’s expectations for preparations for the upcoming battles, events and the construction of diplomatic relations.Based on the volume of information, the clans were largely counted on the possibility of flexible and multifaceted interaction not only between game communities, but also between individual players.

Dynamic missions full of enemies of the Empireum for some time dragged on all the players.And after the fans enjoyed the PVE mode and got a lot of positive impressions, the large stream of players switched to the PVP mode.Here they were faced with a huge number of problems, among which the most striking example is the lack of a stable connection when starting matches.The clans, for their part, felt this problem in a double size - in addition to constant disconects, the problem with the stability of even a simple gathering of a group of three people was added.

Enough time has passed, but the players received only one patch that corrects small and insignificant ones - against the general background - problems.This fact currently causes open discontent among players.For clans, the situation is currently aggravated by the fact that there are absolutely no tools for inter -plane interaction and recruiting.If a team of developers in the process of creating a game was interested in the history and experience of the original Space Marine, then he probably knows - in many ways, clans supported the activity there.And they still do it.Even after 13 years, the game contains inter -clan events, interaction and activity.A flexible system for setting a private lobby in the original Space Marine allows you to gather teams up to 8 people from each side.A simple click on the player’s nickname enables the apothecaria in a short time to recruit a talented player to his team.In Space Marine 2, not one of these aspects was implemented.We understand that this game was not promised as a complete reflection of the first part, but the limitation existing in it is fundamentally killing the creation of strong relationships between players and the formation of a large stable community of fans of Space Marine 2.

The developers offer players to leave on the forum and in Discord reviews about problems in the game, but they never give specific answers or reports about the work done.But on the Internet, interviews are heard in full swing, rumors about the development of new games pop up.And even about the third part of Space Marine.

Perhaps this is an unwillingness to take responsibility for the fate and development of his project, which successfully “shot” against the background of the absence of other Warhammer40k games.Perhaps my opinion is a mistake, and somewhere in the depths of the studio is preparing for the exit mythical, magical, everything correcting patch.But these are only theories and assumptions that will be refuted or confirmed in the future.

And we players want to be heard now.",2024/10/8,ru

Game General Comment: 8.5/10
At present, more than 100 hours of fulfilling customs clearance, the experience is a refreshing battle, everything is cut, killing a blood path in the Terren Zerg.Local customs clearance, but there are no rewards and attributes in the battle, but simply watching the plot, the battle is very much, the melee is handsome, most of the content of the game is on the content of the PVE, but all of them are repeated levels.Level and weapon level, if you don't like to brush, the content of this game may be relatively small. About 5 to 10 hours of campaign plot, there are still problems in the game. The default button is very unfriendly., The game balance is not very good, the optional weapons and the ability to play are those who are available. Playing needs to be proficient in counterattack to have a good game experience. PVE content can be proficient in the shield guard (using the shield back).It's easy to play other occupations.

In general, the war hammer powder can consider buying and playing. If it is not a war hammer powder and does not like to brush, the original price is a bit high at the current price.

We fight for Macragg!
Simplicity, conciseness, attention to details and dynamic gameplay - everything is short and clear, but how much pleasure from playing this.The plot was completed by the full composition in the coop for a couple of evenings under the fun cutting of tyranids and the appeal ""brother"" to each other.The plot itself is not some kind of superly deep story.Classic (as in Waha Community they love to call it) Bolter Porno with a “unexpected” turn, but replete with pathos, the spirit of a battle fraternity, epic skirmishes and beautiful locations.You feel that you got into a small story in the gloomy universe of a distant future.Different referers were pleased, including the previous part of both the bolt Ganu, and the back characters.All that we have been expecting for so long from Varhammer in Gamdev.
The operations are mostly interesting, some mechanics pleasantly surprised.In general, they were more vigorous than the plot due to customization and class features.
PVP Pure KAF.Easy to Play, Hard to Master.The mode with a dynamic point jumping on the map, classic dedication of points and a command Desmach.Fun, cheerfully, but the close battle here works a little imbalance in my opinion.

At the exit, optimization disappeared: for some reason the game began to bent in single operations, but in the coop everything was played normally.In the PVP mode, the FPS was also less than in others (add an endless throwing with shock grenades here, the effects of the hammer at the attack aircraft and the ultimate tactical, which together sometimes made this mode non -granular).In the scenes with an abundance of effects, obvious drawdowns appeared, here my pieces of iron did not stretch.
With the last patch, the optimizon improved and the multiplayer played without any problems.In no case do not put the game on the HDD.Well, either put it and then with each load screen you will have time to brew and drink tea, do cleaning and go to the store.

I'm waiting for more content, new classes and cosmetics on chaos.Well, the Sizon Pass on the Dark Angels)))

Advantages: Together with the Biochan Space Marine, the enemy of the human race is a very simple and linear structure, but it is a great visual and a exciting blow.Aesthetically beautiful scenery, magnificent spiers, sloppy structures, and flocking enemies, you will see you as a guardian of mankind placed in the middle of the battle.The battle itself is very fun

Disadvantages: There are too many nucleus in PVP (recommend not), PVE content is too small.Currently, if you want to create one of the six classes, you have to do more than 12 editions. There are only six PVE maps.If you are a story -oriented gamer, you won't recommend much, and there are quite a few bugs, especially bugs that interfere with gameplay, so this is a strong space marine that you think is the farm of Chaos Zenchi.Demand

Sokomol,1,10.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020348663/,"Space Marine 2, a highly anticipated game of many players.So what to say.I got to this game because of the late delivery of Ultrawide Support some time later, but all the hype I heard around, how excellent and super game, held me all the time, so I waited forsavor.

Is it as excellent and the best as everyone says?He's not!Is it a bad game?Nor do you definitely.It is a good game for one finish that is knocked down by bad gameplay by decisions of developers.If we do not take Lore into account, because I do not follow Lore 40k much, I ended up at fantasy, so I noticed a few strange things.But aside.

Let's start with the positives: the game looks good, it is perfectly optimized, for some type ""the greater the better"" the game can cause a wow effect.The soundtrack, although it is not the best, will find a few good songs that you want to listen to several times in the evening, sound and dubbing.

And what about the negatives that I think will collide?The wrong decision type ""hold the button E half a second so you can complete the ammunition.""Level design, although the world is nice, so often repeats.Go to point A, press the button, go to point B, punch the point ... and these are probably the only 2 things you will do in this game.

Further control ... I played the game on the hardest difficulty and most of the deaths were caused precisely because Titus did something I didn't want from him.Do you attack meele by attacking enemies?What if Titus gave up and began to attack the void, where no one stands?In the game you control your attacks close to the movement keys, not by attacking where you are looking.

And another thing.The game is not very well solved input.Do you make a miserable and then do you want to make Parry?Well, you are unlucky, you have to wait for Titus to complete the animation before pressing the button, because the game does not register this.And there are plenty of such moments.Do you jump and want to throw a grenade?You're unlucky again.
The game does not contain the graceful Combat, as Doom does, where you literally do a combat ballet and everything is in beautiful harmony.


Titus, Space Marine, the best of the best.A genetically modified individual ... Here the developers said that it would not be bad if the shooting from the side was totally inaccurate and even at 20cm you can miss your enemy's hub of the size of the building.In the game you can even head to have more accuracy, but at the moment you are slowed down in a mode where the enemy can totally cut you in 1 second, you really do not want.The fact that enemies are 100% accurate with their shooting.

Bosses are not bad, but I noticed another problem with them.There is a Dodge mechanics in the game, where when you timed it correctly, you can earn more injuries when you shoot it with a script to a weaker place.This sounds good on paper, but it is not polished in the design, because you are not immune to the other phenomena, so the enemy can cut you in about 1 second animation.

Ai enemies are OK, AI companions ... They try, but sometimes they make strange decisions, like if they are to pick you up your three times, look at you, start shooting and then start to revive.

The story is here, but none of you would sit on your ass.

The game is good as this is good and I can definitely recommend it to all who like to turn off the brain and massage a lot of enemies.Unfortunately, these few imperfections do not make it as excellent as everyone says.Repair these shortcomings, accelerate Combat and it will be a great game.I am curious about further extensions.If I ever find friends, I will definitely try the COOP regime.

For me, the game is of quality 7 out of 10 and it is worth playing it.",2024/9/28,cs

XD

Be sure to praise which time after several updates, the EAC of this game will no longer cause memory Standby List to quickly increase and fill a large amount of free memory, so that it may fill the free memory.Leaving the game program is almost right, unlike the previous time because EAC will be stuck for a while.The EAC of the new game sword god domain dream border will not be the case, it may be new.

Because the old -fashioned EAC will not take long after each game is executed, the complete game files will cause Standby List to increase rapidly. People with less memory or more free memory will be filled, compared with Popular machine war mercenaries VI and Eliden Faf Ring are still the same.
YouTube ™ Video: EAC Enabled
Views: 14


When the Standby List memory block is filled with idle memory, the system can cause wonderful problems.
The game is probably the increase in stuttering and INPUT Delay, and adjusting the game setting will not improve, making people think that the optimization is not good, because it is affected when using memory.Some people may not feel that after all, it may be occasionally jumping in the allowable range, but mainly because the fluency will be affected.
Others have some inexplicable phenomena such as spraying, spraying errors during compilation, insufficient image processing and jump memory, but not using complete memory in the use, and they really need to use memory. Virtual memory reduces efficiency.
Until now, Windows 11 is still the same. It may not be a problem. After all, the memory is not in vain, but I do n’t know why there is something to use after filling.
Anyway, do n’t go to clear memory. You must not shut down for a long time before you can fill it up slowly. You may only be cleaned up.
In this case, you can download the Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) author of the Intelligent Standby List Cleaner, which is specially written for this situation. Just set the trigger conditions. Set up too positive.",2024/10/10,ko

The story is a little bland but fun and enjoyable, the PVP is great, and the PVE is also great!

By the Emperor, they did it! They fixed the game! The crashes stopped and they fixed the Linux/Steam Deck compatibility issue! We just got through two more story missions together tonight (10/11/24) and it was a BLAST! Thank you devs so much for creating this amazing game! Hopefully it doesn't get broken with another patch again. If it does, at least now I can trust it will be fixed.
The game is very fun and has just so much cool set design; really nails the whole 40K aesthetic. And I love running into stuff or hearing someone talk about something in the lore and then being able to explain it to my Warhammer-novitiate cousins and they go ""Ohhhh that's so coool!"" In tonight's session, the older one noticed a servitor plugged into the wall as he was walking past and he was like ""Woah guys guys come look at this! Its the most messed up thing so far; he's like plugged into the wall!"" And then I got to explain how the guy was probably a criminal, but maybe a failed astartes aspirant depending on the chapter... or just someone that someone else didn't like haha. We are having a great time and it is really getting them into the universe in a great way. Again, thank you for fixing it under the guidance of the Omnissiah. Praise be to the Emperor!

Original negative review after patch 3.0:
I love this game soooo much man, it hurts me to leave a negative review. This 3.0 patch really messed it up for me and my cousins though. It crashes like every 5 minutes now. And one of them was playing on a Steam Deck and now it doesn't even let Linux users login for online play any more? It worked before the patch just fine and we had already played through the first 2 story missions and the first Operations mission. Just wasted 3 hours TRYING to play through more of the story. First had to install it on a spare computer so the Steam Deck user could play. Now every time we go into a mission it works for about 5 minutes then crashes. Whole game freezes, white screen, windows does the whole ""This program isn't responding"" thing. Just so disappointed right now. Will change this if they fix it and I desperately hope they do, otherwise we wasted about $175.",2024/9/28,en

I have come across YouTube more than once thought that Russia is Warhammer 40k.And however, we have something like that from Wahi, a lot of intersections.This game only proves how much Russians subtly feel this universe, because this game was developed by developers from St. Petersburg and at the moment - this is the most successful and best game on Warhammer 40k.And before that, other Russian developers have made a cool RPG Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader.Russia knows how and can when it is allowed.It is ironic that the British came up with Warhammer, and it is the Russians who perfectly understand it.

Why is the game so good?And let's understand.

1) The absolute absence of a Western political agenda, which at the genetic level is alien to Russians, as for the children of the emperor, the ideas of xenos are alien to.There is only Warhammer 40k in their dirty and gloomy splendor, no non -warrous personalities, nasty feminists and no one scolds Donald Trump.Yes, in this game they give us to play for the team from white, black and Asian, who, after passing the game, become like relatives.And so it was possible?Of course, you just need to register and serve the characters so that people like them.That's how simple as it turned out.

2) overcoming.What is this game is complicated, it is perfect perfectly by this the spirit of the universe.There is a coope in the game and it is not added here for a checkmark, it will be hard without it.So that you understand that the game has additional missions for another detachment of spaceport, this is PVE, which is imprisoned for a coope.If you try to play without brothers with bots, then even on the most minimal complexity, get ready to overcome and fight at the limit of your capabilities, for Tyranids and the Order of thousands of sons will literally destroy you.And this is after a patch, in which the difficulty was reduced, and the “director”, which, as in Left4dead, generates random skirmishes with enemies, reduced aggressiveness.I am scared to imagine what hell was going on on the maximum complexity before the patch, it was probably easier to win the gods of chaos than to pass it.

3) Visual.The game conveys the spirit of the universe with its appearance.Huge industrial buildings, no, not so, huge industrial buildings.Paphos, no, not so, pathos.You look at this and do not want to be there for any money, which is absolutely right, because Warhammer 40k is a nightmare in which there is only a place for suffering.

4) Oda to militarism and brotherhood.The game perfectly conveys the spirit of partnership and sensations of himself part of something immense, which is the Imperium.If before this game you did not know about the emperor, then after the game the word ""emperor"" protects ""will become part of you.The game conveys the concept of ""heroism"" by all 200%, there are real soldiers who are ready to give all themselves in the name of their race.The Cadians are generally handsome, run such small space -breeds, and they have no less courage than the angels of the emperor, in whom fear is specially turned off in the brains.

5) gameplay.This is the same classic DOOM meat.The weapon makes ""bang-bah"", and the enemy turns into minced meat.What else do you need for happiness?You feel the weight of the armor, what are the cosmodes heavy.And the enemies are really felt by a threat, for which the Imperium became so cruel, having built a vertical of power and unscrewing the ideology of militarism to the maximum.It’s not a shame with such enemies to be f*with a wool, but very reasonable.

6) the hordes of enemies.I love this technology that allows you to make a lot of enemies on the screen.We could see her before in the stunning dilogy of the games A Plague Tale, where there were hordes of rats.And here instead of rats we have tyranides, which are many times more dangerous and larger.This is a really impressive sight that you also have to fight.

7) Tit.The main character, he is a white cisgender man of a natural, who is not some kind of insignificance, but a really great hero who, even in the conditions of the Imperium, remains a good person.Lord, I have already forgotten with these Western games that it happens.Titus is very cool, he is immune to the influence of the warp, and he is also a saint, for the emperor himself talks to him.This means that he can play an important role in the universe, I personally think that he can close the great break, sharing the Imperium into two halves.God forbid, if the western agenda once wounds Titus and Warhammer 40k, I conjure the fans of the universe to fight against this disgrace.

Does the game have minuses?I did not notice them.True, I have nothing to scold the game for.Everything is played perfectly, the waha is transmitted in all its glory, the plot is simple and at the same time interesting.The price/quality ratio is excellent.Can the game interest not only fans?Of course it can, this is a cool meat jumper, the language of meat is understandable to any gamer.You can not miss this game, you must definitely play this.",2024/10/3,ru

Stefan_Melchiott,1,81.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolf_Ratnik/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - naturally, one of the best games of 2024.
It is worth noting right away that I am not an ardent fan, played literally in a couple of games in the universe, once tried to figure it out in a hunger strike, but threw it.First of all, I became interested in the project, like aa-game from my fellow countrymen.
Space Marine 2 passed in the solo, initially there were plans to play with friends, but it did not grow together and immediately note that playing without a cooperative is not difficult even on high difficulties, so if someone tells you about the need to play with a company of friends, this is not necessary.
It is also important to note the most excellent optimization (against the background of other titles of 24 years, the game looks great, but at the same time requires much less resources).
The plot covers the continuation of the story of the Titus ultramarine, who returned from the guard of death and set about new tasks (I advise you to go through the first part in order to completely immerse himself in the game).And then we simply follow the instructions of the command, carry out tasks and as a result of the past of our hero is mixed with the present, which is built in a new epic history.
The gameplain game is ochering, a combat system is very balanced, where it is necessary to use not only firearms, but also with cold weapons.The game makes you always be at the middle distance, not to go far from the enemy, but not to break into the Epic itself.There are many missions that bring a completely new experience, some interesting mechanics.
In addition to the plot missions, there are additional tasks that cover the events, which occurred against the background in the main plot.There is already pumping, different classes, which adds interest to the game.In the future, developers promise to add more and more new missions.
The multiplayer is excellent, for once, we do not need to endlessly download some guns, knock out some ranks.The network game simply gives funny emotions, which has long been missing in modern games.

I definitely advise the game of both solo and team players, you will have fun.

Plot
The plot is very simple, I won’t spoil it, but it has come to me, it intersects closely with the plot of the first part (which I did not play, but I will definitely play) that I can say about the plot at all - it will be a bit of the type of “this evil one must kill, and this subject should be killed, and this subjectIt is necessary to break "", but even so the game can surprise with sharp turns, and in some places you do not expect what will happen next, in general the plot is normal, I put Boltgana 7 out of 10
Gameplay
Gameplay is an ordinary robilovo, but what, but the blood is chew, different sutures and animations are also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyway, there is a parry, a bias and some kind of shot and the most high is a finishing ... here is finishing up as inDuma is the same bloody and high, different finishing on all kinds of enemies from the small beetle of tyranid to fuck ... And then you will see who you can finish, the blood is 10/10 of it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anywayI like it.I put 9 VAAAGX of 10 for gemplepley.
Graphics without questions - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as if you are watching a movie, facial expressions, armor quality, card details and everything that is on the map looks gasped.About the atmosphere of the map and the game itself also rolls over, in some moments goosebumps go on the skin, so it is Ahuenna.
In general, I put 10 chain swords out of 10
He is the main character as thought out as much as possible, his character, his speech is simply Ahuenna, when you play for him, you feel like a real lieutenant of the Ultramarin company.
Captain, Capellan and Kalgar - all of them are also made cool and thoughtfully, each of them has different relationships to the GG, for example, the chaplain does not particularly trust the main character and says that he will always follow him, the captain loves GG (not in the sense)He trusts him and gives out difficult tasks, and Kalgar simply loves GG, he trusts him greatly and believes in him
Minor characters - two secondary characters who pass the company with us, they are also made very well, each of them has its own character and dialect, each of them belongs to heretics, tyranids and GG are different, there are moments in which I was very worried about them
Characters in the form of classes - I played only for two of course, but then I will definitely play for others.
The class ""support"" is silent and strict, communicates only with military phrases and words, to kill the buzz for it, a heavy bolter makes a rattatata and now the enemy exploded the head
The class ""Sturmovik"" is also silent, but less strict, to kill a separate buzz for it, he just hates heretics and xenos, and therefore screams how he does not like them much
In general, I put 8 chaplains out of 10 for characters
In general, I am sure that this game of the year, if not - the emperor’s sword in the ass, the game absolutely deservedly received so many positive reviews.

Zacirus,0,86.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zacirus/,"Pre patch 3, this game would have been one of my highest recommended Warhammer 40K games ever made.

Now? Probably not.

Gameplay loop and game feel were fantastic PRE Patch 3, some balancing was off, but overall it was hectic fun challenge on Ruthless/Angel of Death (Difficulty 4) and it felt like an earned victory when you and your buddies pulled it off.

Post Patch 3, there are practically no enemy hordes throughout each Operations level, certainly none that are overwhelming. There are tiny little groups of enemies that pose no real threat scattered distantly from each other so you have plenty of time to to kill the five or six enemies on screen and then run for 2-3 minutes taking in the sights with nothing to do to the next tiny group of enemies, any big bad type enemies spawn in basically solo, so you can easily focus them with no pressure and destroy them in seconds. Can now easily Duo every Operations on Difficulty 4 and grind with no real challenge, but why would I? It's dull to play currently and more prone to crashing.

The campaign was a fantastic, and focused fight for your life on launch and the story beats are still wonderful, loved seeing Titus make his return. Played on Angel of Death the first time through with a buddy and it took us about 10-12 hours. It was a really fun overcoming the odds by being a good team and covering each other. Not anymore.

Currently I could replay the campaign post Patch 3 on Angel of Death and solo it without resistance. That's not fun or a challenge. Why even have different difficulties at this point if they're all easy mode.

I will gladly change my review if they fix the spawn rates, fix the constant crashing and make this fun to play again.",2024/9/27,en

I guess Saber is unaware what happened with Helldivers 2, I just hope it doesn't take them as long to realize no one wants these changes. Limited ammo uses, sounds really dumb for heavies and snipers that rely on ammo but ok, tougher enemies, they already take 3/4 of the mag to get to the executable stage but ok.
-70% melta-bomb damage to bosses? It only has one use, and that was its designated purpose, what were you thinking? The worst offense being, putting the imaginary leash on teammates so if the need to restore armor is present it CANNOT be done unless teammates are nearby? Who thought that was a good decision, I would love to see how that idea was received in the board room if Saber even held a meeting for this design choice.
Either none of Saber plays their own game or they just wanted their player base to leave because playing one game would have told you that snipers, assaults, and vanguards tend to leave their allies to focus on damage dealers to help the team but now they are punished for doing so. Having to constantly check to see if your team is near you so you can restore your only source of replenish-able health is insanely stupid and means that if we use our ability to grapple, or jump pack to a distant enemy (which is what its class is literally SUPPOSED TO DO) we are punished for it by not receiving armor back.

Matchmaking is horrrrible.

I spend so much time just trying to get into a match and every step along the way the game is likely to give you an error after a long load screen. Sometimes immediately upon selecting match make it gives you loading screens and then times out, sometimes you're still in your own world and someone else tries to join you and times out. Sometimes you are trying to join someone else's match and long load screen and... times out.

Then, when you finally manage to join a match with other players, half the time you've both chosen the same class and one of you is forced to leave or change to another class that you may not have leveled up high enough to the difficulty you've already selected when choosing matchmaking, you now have to quit the matchmake or risk sabotaging the match for the other players because you dont have the right perks/weapons on this character to pull your own weight.

It's just a badly designed process. And this could at least be balanced out if the game was tuned in a way that you could actually manage things solo. But that's not possible with the garbage NPCs they give you for squadmates. Unless you're max level with max level guns, you're likely not going to be able to pull off even the first operations on easy difficulty.

So much of this game needs more time to cook. Look at the subreddit and you'll see posts like where you upgrade the same weapon and some of its stats go down. Why is that a thing? Not a variant weapon, but the same one has lower stats at a higher level. It's just nonsensical stuff.

I have yet to successfully close the game via the ingame menu without it freezing. Have to alt+f4 or force it to stop via steam. At the end of every mission I either get disconnected or sit through incredibly long load times as the game hangs, then disconnects me from the squad I was with.

Oh, and then the few times I've managed to get a really solid group together and are crushing a mission, 30+ minutes in, the game can hard crash where I'm then forced to reboot my PC and there is no option to rejoin squad mates. So not only do you not get to complete the mission, you get literally zero rewards from it. No XP per kill or per objective completed while you were in the mission. XP only comes at the end of the mission... Again, who in 2024 came up with these backwards ideas and terrible net code?

""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2"" feels like a breath of fresh air in today’s gaming landscape, crafted by skilled artists and developers who clearly understand the community’s hunger for an unfiltered, raw gaming experience. This game is a love letter to fans, unapologetically delivering a brutal, power-fantasy experience that stands in stark contrast to the tired formulas of modern AAA titles.

In an era plagued by bloated open-worlds, tedious ""complex"" characters, and invasive microtransactions, SM2 stays true to its roots. The result? A fully immersive journey that strips away the unnecessary and focuses on the essentials: visceral combat, duty, discipline, courage, and brotherhood. If you played the first Space Marine, you'll instantly connect with the tone and spirit of this sequel—it's all about men who get the job done, no matter the odds. It is obvious that the setting is taken seriously, and nothing seems out of place, the protagonists BELONG, they are not forced in.

Even though the co-op and campaign content might seem light in comparison to other games, the sheer fun and intensity of the gameplay more than make up for it. And while it's not the biggest game out there, every moment of SM2 is crafted with precision and care.

Whether you’re playing with friends, strangers, or even bots, the experience is consistently thrilling. Kudos to the developers at Saber Interactive for pulling this off in today's gaming climate, and a special thanks to the publishers for respecting the creative vision.

Gameplain game is an action from a third person with all the ensuing.We get the task and go cut the path from point A to point B. Here I note, the locations are ideologically “corridor”, but the developer tried and gave the most diversity in the fresh air and at least wandering in the dull corridors of the plants (but where without it).On the periphery, something explodes periodically, breaks and a different motion occurs, in every possible way emphasizing the scale of what is happening.The benefit of the schedule did not disappoint and everything looks great, helping immersion in what is happening on the monitor screen.The arsenal for bringing to agreement will definitely not amaze your imagination, but you can find something cut, automatic or semi -automatic you can find it without difficulty.

Management is normal, there are simple combo for cold weapons, tags on enemies about a blocked \ non -blocked attack.Everything is fine, but only until the moment when the attacking mobs becomes very many, everything risks merging into porridge and forces to make constant somersaults.He himself went through the game in Solo, on the Veteran and periodically met the moments where the game did not allow to take a break, in Pati it would not be relevant.Boodles help a little on the battlefield, but you should not lay strong hopes on them.In general, if you do not plan to attract comrades to the passage, they are not worthless to stuffiness and just want to relax, then the first two options of difficulties will be the best choice.

I also note the local PVE mission coop - ""battle"".They become accessible gradually, as they pass through the plot, slightly supplementing the main branch of the actions of GG.Choose the attracted class of the space marineer, weapons, the level of complexity and go to shred all living things with two more comrades or random players.Very cheerfully played at the first acquaintances with locations.In parallel, the local currency, the experience and level, which are necessary for changing the appearance of the online character, the appearance of weapons and pumping of the peak tree, are farm there.In a word - Grind.

There is also a PVP of battles, but this is already for an amateur.The passage of this regime will not affect the impression of the game.

The plot here is simple and unpretentious, we are standardly trying to prevent a disaster, but it turns out that not everything is so simple and some hidden forces can be involved here.Just right, so that the player is not overloaded with information against the background of what is happening on the screen.The passage time will vary around 8-9 hours.

As a result, this project is not perfect and, if desired, you can get minuses and shortcomings, but there are no perfect games.Here, an exciting company allowing you to visit three worlds and feel like a brutal space marineer who is overcoming everything in the world goes to his goal.And the visual component helps to better feel this immersion.Saber's domestic developers did a great job.I am sure that this project was worth impressive forces and nerves ... and they coped.

Well, let's get down (it is not necessary to write it every time, otherwise they will probably not understand)
The game meets us with a juicy count and brutal narrative (what, everything is very serious here, without a story?
Literally already in the training mission, you will feel the physical severity and power of your character.
Nevertheless, the entry is quite sharp and throws it immediately into battle, so that, perhaps, there will be many questions unfamiliar with the game.
This world is full of its own terms and free interpretations of your usual things.
In view of the fact that I am not a fan of Varhamer, but I am familiar with almost the whole Laura (yes, not at all a fan, whom you are deceiving)
Everything that happens on the screen is quite logical and logical for me, I recommend that the resters trust the rest.
They tried to, albeit with a roll, but slowly tell the story along the way with what was happening.(I still want more exposition at the beginning)
But at least a couple of 3 hours of video about ENT, race, etc.Still, I recommend that you look at Utababa (or 10, well, at least 5)

The first impression was - as if they took the 5th and added their native Roy technology.
We also cut the alien monster (brown Pokemon) with a pilome (pyloric) and shreds the swarm of an alien monster.
In general, games are related by the abundance of steep pathos rollers and bloody battle per unit of time.(Unfortunately, including battles - also monotonous)

We played in a cooperate-the game requires immersion for 40-60 minutes for each mission, which is even worse than a rink in any mob-to-game, becauseIt is worth interrupting you to someone - everything flies to hell at once and you don’t want to play after a couple of breaks.
And since progress is not preserved in any way, you will replay everything from the beginning.
Which again kills the immersion.
For a visual, the game receives 10k, but for a monotonous hire -like gameplay above 7 does not pull.
So play at my own peril and risk, I personally do not want to continue.
Cook for several hours in a row when you are not worried (I am still deprived of such luxury)

Yi,0,70.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198404181904/,"After playing for 40 hours, the view is that the feeling of 40K is a very low -degree of completion.
Personal core point of view
PVE does not make people feel the sense of cutting, and my melee weapon feels stuck.
PVP has a fascinated garbage that is not as good as the page tour.
1. From the story, this game feels like a three -person Superman. The scene is indeed very large. The plot is pure American personal hero film. Then what?I can't see Astart's tactical literacy. The boss is classic to suppress the rights. If you have objections and put forward tactical ideas, you will blush and your neck and stress you as the company commander. The extreme soldier?Then talk about the problem of the three teams. The gunfire on the battlefield is still arguing there to fight there to make a temper there. The Star Army next to the Star Army sacrificed to defend the empire. Tactical literacy is famous for its political mind?Is it possible to let you go more than the chaos?
2. Game playability, two major modes PVP and PVE
The problem of PVP is very large, the production is extremely rough, and the game such as the life and death sniper that is not even inferior to the page game is not even a small map. Is this a Star Warrior?Or is it a primitive fight?The program UI rough is the same as a page game.The overall idea of ​​the PVP is that every occupation of Overwatch has skills and every occupation has a special weapon without any more. You can learn the COD killing rewards. Besides Flying, you can't look up at all below.
The problem of PVE is not as big as PVP but it is also very against the sky. In the past, this type of game was either melee and unparalleled. The zombie flesh flew into the tank and was nervous. The cattle rider's monkey and AOE spitting the single kill with the bull can brag. What are the Star Warriors 2?The melee cutting grass is not hand -of -hand and is abstract. I am afraid it is difficult to keep up with the dull tide group. After pulling the difficulty, it is even more prominent after pulling the difficulty. As a result, the difficulty did not change before the team dared to run customs.
The mechanism of PVE is simply that the firearms are only available to play with hot -melt grenades and plasma. The core daddy system of the melee system game is born for this gadget, because the guns are not specifically prepared at all preparations. The mechanism of special income (don't tell me the pure value of the hot -melt BUG to the light), melee weapons have made three forms for you in order to torture, namely the three attributes of the backbound balance block That is, the core mechanism to fight counterattack to improve the first one is to extend the counterattack window. The second is the window that is default counterattack. The third one cannot fight back. The counterattack can also give the mob's scraping the second, the third one that seems to have given it against the sky is actually still in jail because the core counterattack mechanism cannot be triggered. Back to the white value, you will only be interrupted in the strange pile and you will be interrupted with the warrior's red knife)
You do n’t unlock the complete skill tree or several core professional skills, just go to jail and say that you are your thunder hammer!Which PVE's profession requires frequent release skills to get a big CD?From the thunder hammer to the pistol proficiency, right? The output of the early scraping was interrupted and the charged person was still dying by the remote monster. Is this a PVE? A game that does not allow players to cool?",2024/10/10,zh-cn

At this point it's not a game, it's a chore and I'm disappointed.

The world, setting, etc are all really nice. It's oddly relatively well performing too which is more than can be said for a lot of bigger games in the last five years.

But, it's busted. The enemy AI targets only the player, doesn't take into account the player mechanics - so you're more than likely to end up between getting hit and getting hit, because if you deign it necessary to block, dodge or parry you are also allowing something else to do their thing because they basically ignore the rest of the squad. This extends out of the campaign to bots in the Operations mode, so there's no respite from awful mechanical failure there either. Never mind the minibosses that stunlock you because you miss a dodge and because of recovery animation just wail on you from 100% to 0 with no way to escape due to how the attack chains are set up. Or the lack of indicator on 90% of parry-possible attacks, or the lack of any form of recovery outside of what would be UT99's worst healing pack in a game that a basic mob can stunlock the protagonist. Ugh.

It feels like an attempt to implement an Arkham style riposte system, but it doesn't work when everything you do with it leaves you open to more damage. Why even use it at that point. Stop targeting only the damned player to the point it's not playable. Please.

EDIT:
After more playtime, some time in multiplayer and practice with the game systems;
Still not sure I want to recommend this.

Multiplayer routinely has connection/stability issues which are not PC/ISP connection related from what I've seen, and the combat whilst satisfying at times still has the issues with stunlock etc.

AI squad members (which you unfortunately see often) are also worse than I initially thought in both campaign and online, having no capability to follow directions (such as attack/defend) featured as part of the main UI, no perks in Operations, no proper target priority when picking one out, no damage against actual boss tier enemies, and more. About the only thing they can do properly is fire a weapon at mobs and recover their own health outside of combat, leaving everything for the player(s) to do which can be borderline impossible. They routinely ruin Operations runs for example.

This game has a single player tag on Steam, but truthfully is not one. If you would buy it as a single player game, look into the solo gameplay in existing videos or streams first as it's a bit deceiving to say it truly is a single player title. It's ALL focused on having a (human) group. All of it.",2024/10/6,en

The PvE Operations mode shows off how good the combat feels and how well it's designed. Highly replayable for anyone who falls in love with the game.

The PvP Versus mode is not very highly developed, and is very small scale instead of large scale like I'm sure most players would prefer it, but it benefits greatly from being dumb fun thanks to the game's basic mechanics.

Humble Beings,1,32.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HERECATCH/,"Space Marine 2 improves from its predecessors by building up from what made it great for me in the past. Filling the shoes of Titus once more, you are now a Primaris marine (super space marine). Bigger and badder, you and two of your other buddies (coop) or AI companions are required to prune the Tyrannids (think Zerg from Starcraft, but much nastier) and put an end to their invasion.

Using the same engine from WWZ the devs at Saber Interactive have managed to capture what it would feel like to participate in an uphill battle against endless the Tyrannids. With hundreds of enemies on screen at the same time, you are required to use all you have in your arsenal and eliminate the xeno threat in the name of the God Emperor and boy is it intense on higher difficulties.

Though big and bad, you are still only human and while the smaller Tyrannids wont have you breaking a sweat the bigger and nastier ones will. I like how in higher difficulties you are required to time your attacks properly and use your ultimate move strategically to turn the tide against the horde of xenos rushing at you.

Simply put, I like the gameplay in Space Marine 2 as it manages to capture what it would feel like to be a super soldier in the 40k-verse, the small tyrannid variants explode as you stomp and chop your way through them, while the big ones will have you ripping off their heads in an execution style move.

Fun fact, you can literally run through small traitor guardsman and they would explode and turn into paste!

Story-wise it's your run of the mill 40K game, one minute you're dealing with a tyrannid invasion and the next will have you once again dealing with Chaos. It's nothing new, but the presentation is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Thanks to the technology that the devs utilize, the guardsman are in full display here and I was so happy to be able to fight alongside them once more.

So much stuff goes on in the background and in some instances you can even assist the fights that are happening in the background should you wish. It doesn't add anything to the story but it was nice to know that you are part of a larger scale fight and that everyone in the vicinity plays an important role in it.

For those who are worried, yes the game is a sequel but the events from the first game is told to you relatively well and not to mention its pretty straightforward. So no worries on not being able to catch up or anything if you did not play Space Marine 1.

Longevity-wise the game offers different game modes other than campaign such as Operations which is the PVE mode. This mode will have you squad up with pals and/or randoms to level up the different classes and unlock customization options. This customization is also extended to the PVP mode which is fine, I enjoy playing it with my friends and some matches can be quite intense at times.

All in all I think Space Marine 2 is a good game, the presentation is great, campaign was engaging and serving the God Emperor once more has never felt more satisfactory! an easy 7/10 for me!",2024/10/6,en

[4.1 Review] Glad to see a responsive set of devs this time around who seriously considered whether they were correct in their decisions or not. Removing the Armor Tether is a great change since the initial system was poorly thought out to begin with. Hopefully they add a different modifier down the line that creates meaning without hamstringing your own gameplay. Also glad to see the Bolt weapons finally getting the love they deserve. Honestly, it was criminal how lousy they were at the start since Saber have managed incredible Bolt weapon sound design and feel that just made them feel good to shoot despite being impractical due to low damage. I'm generally ambivalent toward the armor changes but hopefully it gives more people more margin for error due to not everyone being parry gods or being so overwhelmingly good that they can carry a whole team out of a completely FUBAR scenario single-handedly.

weapon variety, enemy variety, ramping up difficulty in combat, powering up/adding skills all REALLY lacking.

Combat is OK, melee is ONE (1) button, and feels a little float-y and doesn't have much ""punch"" you kind of just glide through enemies without resistance (outside of executions). parry/dodge/counter works sometimes, doesn't feel consistent. You end up getting staggered, stun locked, or stuck in a reload way to often. It's often not clear why you've taken damage or from where. The input/output in combat just feels kinda weird.

You have to push the SAME button 5000 times, whether an elevator or some other interaction with the environment, it's the same asset. Never a puzzle, or a different way to ""activate"" whatever needs to be activate. Clearly cut corners here.

Cut scenes, pretty good. Some odd points where it feels like a set piece should go fade to black and back in instead. Seems they rushed in several spots.

Story, bare bones but fine. Didn't utilize one of the best-developed fantasy worlds in all of fiction. Voice acting is excellent, and so is the writing though.

.

Other games do what this game should, but better. Helldivers II has better combat. This game takes a lot influence from DOOM, but doesn't execute as well: guns lack punch, glory kills are less rewarding, you have to pause to pick up ammo, mis-calibrated resource scarcity, too many 1 shot horde enemies, too little variety besides ""more"" enemies and no coordination among them.

- Inquisitor Titus Drake

In my opinion, Space Marine 2 should be evaluated in two planes - directly as a game and as a product in the universe of an endless war.

With confidence, we can say that at the moment, in terms of visualizing the Vakhov’s aesthetics, all this “Bolter Porn”, pathos overcoming and other attributes, to save Marina 2 is the best representative.For a fan and a person at least more or less interested, the game is simply a real gift.Artists perfectly coped with their task.Architecture, interior design, elements of armor and weapons.Did you want to see in all its glory the legendary Baneblade?- Please.Maybe the titan of the ""Emperor"" class?- Hold!True, with some reservations, but still!Shoots shoot, hammers moorly moan, and harsh soupovars carry the emperor’s light and quotes from the kids, brother.Here the game is 10/10 completely deserves.There is not enough epic scope.

Reflections give rise to heresy.The heresy gives rise to retribution.
- Epigraph to books about Gregor Eisenhorn

At the same time, the design of levels and some mechanics of the game send us right from the threshold in the 2000s.Frankly admitted such linearity and invisible walls, literally a couple of meters from the only way forward, I have not seen for a long time.Field good QTE in place.It is also worth saying about the choice of complexity.The game does not talk about this anywhere (even vice versa, misleading), but the last two levels of difficulty, obviously balanced under the cooperative, not under the solo passage.2 Bolvanchik is not completely useless, but in the hardness, their sympathy is simply not enough.Therefore, if you play one and want to keep your nerves and positive wibes, do not build daddy, choose the first two.
The campaign on average passes for 6-8 hours.This is quite enough.It is knocked down tightly, in terms of the ratio of events, diversity, epic and some kind of philleric moments.You will not have time to get bored.
The fact that the life will extend the project is the PVU mission and PVP content.From the PVP, it takes Oldskuly.He is very primitive and sends us to the time of Kweik Arena and Anrian Thornation.Against the background of other competitors, a retro fan is very much.But Pve is a local pearl.Here, unlike the campaign, there is also the choice of classes, pumping a character and weapons, the choice of perks and a detailed customization of everything!You can blind yourself your favorite bloody crow from childhood and steal at the Timmates, for example, a first -aid kit from under the nose.All according to Laura!By the way, there are only 6 missions. Although they are very diverse and even surpass the campaign in some places, this is catastrophically few!Their reigree is exactly until you pump your favorite bolt screw and open a cool element of armor.In fairness, the developers promise to tightly support the game and add a bunch of content in the future.Be it new missions, cards and modes for PVP, as well as cosmetics.Separately, I want to throw a stone into the garden of non -car and masticing.They are disgustingly implemented.Endless loads from each action at the stage of selection of players.You can throw you into a game with a person in the same class as you and you will have to either change it or go out and wait for loading again.There are frequent cases of breaking the connection, and it is no longer possible to return to the game.

Its a known issue all over forums yet they just released a new patch and didn't even try fixing it. If you solo Q you might find a 2nd player, and then end up with a bot. If you play with ur friend and u have a bot as 3rd player, its going to be tough on the higher difficulties. Game doesn't have much end game content, just 4 levels and 6 separate operation missions. End game content is lacking, campaign is short, campaign you don't even get to level up or use different loadouts. The loadouts are only available in a separate mode. Gets repetitive with no real differences. But not even being able to play with battle brothers or constantly glithcing and having to play with useless bots. Whats the point of this ""brotherhood"" game when all my brothers are bots? Don't get how SABER has not even attempted to fix this issue last patch OR is aware of it!

NOV 20/2024 They fixed matchmaking not as buggy. Game is a bit easy, on the hardest level difficulty LETHAL mode, you get some skins that show you beat all of it as bragging rights or honor.

Within its first hour, Space Marine 2 hits all the right notes and gets you pumped about the journey ahead. The first thing you notice is how magnificent the game looks and sounds—not just on a technical level, but also in terms of art design. I’m glad that this aspect remains consistent until the end. However, in terms of gameplay, things are sadly not looking so good. At first, the combat feels crunchy and fast, almost like a third-person Doom, but as time goes on, the downsides become more pronounced than the positives. After only a couple of hours, you realize how restrictive the level and mission design is. Additionally, the encounters start to feel superficial due to the lackluster weapon design. Almost every encounter can be easily completed with any of the weapons, which lack identity; as a result, you, as the player, don’t feel in control of the combat—you just go with the flow, shooting mindlessly with a couple of melee combos and finishers here and there.

The story is mindbogglingly simple, but the performances are strong, so the game doesn’t feel entirely lifeless in that regard. It’s also surprisingly a direct sequel, both in terms of story and spirit. I’m pleased that a change in development studio didn’t result in a soft reboot.

All in all, Space Marine 2 is a marvelous technical and artistic achievement; however, it fails to deliver as a compelling video game. I have only played the single-player campaign, so everything I say is directed at that aspect.",2024/10/17,en

SinpaiKuronan,0,53.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116989715/,"I won't deny that Space Marine 2 has some awesome moments (namely, any time you perform an Execution) but it's developers make a lot of decisions that chip away at my patience or otherwise confound me. I'll put a full list below, but some of the major ones are just a lack of cross-class weapon availability, extremely stingy use of I-Frames in a game with a lot of animation locks, and gating progression behind forced difficulty increases.

I also don't like Classes, but that's entirely my preference and I understand that's just how Monetization has decided Modern Gaming is going to develop.

1. Every class should be able to use every sidearm. Canonically, these are all Ultramarines, so you can't use the excuse 'well, different chapters learn different skills!' they are all in the same Chapter, and while I can generally forgive things like Heavies not getting Melee Weapons or Snipers locked to Knives, this is one thing I take major issue with.
2. No Automatic Sidearm at Launch? My trigger finger is getting enough exercise to lift a Bolter Pistol, and I am not a fan. Please add a sidearm that I can hold down the trigger and spray into Tyranid hordes properly.
3. Experience and Currency rewards are absolutely pitiful on Minimal and Moderate. I often won't even be able to afford a Color Pack after a mission on those difficulties, nevermind weapons. I can forgive putting my nose to the grindstone for class experience, but considering that progression is tied to unlocking and mastering weapons (which requires currency to buy every version of a weapon) this isn't okay.
4. Far more egregious is that Artifact and Relic Artifact Data is locked behind Substantial and Ruthless Difficulties respectively. Do you want to progress past Tier 2 Weapons? Well, your options are A) Tryhard, or B) Uninstall.
5. Speaking of Armory Data, it's not guaranteed for completing the mission. One has to be found in the mission (it is guaranteed to spawn, but ) and the other is from bosses that potentially spawn in the mission (but are not guaranteed, and also might coincide with the Horde Timer.)
6. Certain areas are basically guaranteed to Horde, which works heavily against it. Decapitation's Chapel is the best case of this: You can fight a Horde right outside the transition door, kill every Tyranid, enter, miss and then have to fight It's an extremely confined area which makes it even worse.
7. I-Frames are only built into Executions, like five frames of a successful Parry, and half of your Dodge. Most animations otherwise don't even have Hyperarmor, meaning you can get knocked out of your Stim, or you can start a Gunstrike instead of Parry and then get stunlocked and destroyed.
8. Ai cannot be assigned classes in Private Lobbies, nor can they be assigned specific weapons.
9. It's freaking 2024 and Helldivers 2, allows full remapping of all buttons on both Keyboard and Controller, what excuse does Focus have that I can't manually map my Melee to B/Circle button?

Focus recently released PAtch 4.0, and after an extreme amount of backlash, released 4.1 which removed nearly everything we hated from 4.0 (which was basically the whole thing, minus the introduction of Lethal) so the Developers CAN change the game if we demand it enough, and very quickly too.

The first part for people who are not fans do not know Warhammer 40K.
This is an Old School shooting game that we've been playing since many years ago. The mood is similar to Halo. These are good games, fun, challenging. The story may be a little confusing.What is it?Arrived and flirted, we immediately threw into the game.But if you don't look at them, this game is a very enjoyable game.The more you play with friends

The second part for 40k fans
This is the Space Marine game you want.You will see the coolness of Captain Titas that has returned to Ultra Marine again.Saw that Marane fought with the sinos and the trendy(Personally, hahaha)
You will also see the coolness of many characters in the story that, despite the little script, but appeared to create an Impact to a certain extent.Although the story is short and may not be satisfied for the fans and the villains that are a little too small, but overall, the game is good to buy.

Kinoso,1,76.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kinoso/,"My wanderings with the Warhammer franchise date from when I was still a preteen, and it was a fan of the world of Fantasy.I remember with love the first time I had the Internet at home, on that Cream color screen PC, and one of my first searches was with the purpose of seeing new miniatures of the Vampire Condes.
I never understood why 40k unbridled Fantasy so brutally, and although I ended up in love with this new IP, today Fantasy keeps a special place in my heart.

I met Warhammer 40k later than soon, and it was not until the great Rogue Trader that I really understood his world.When the original Space Marine came out, 10 years ago, I still didn't know the delirious depth and darkness of this universe.

Today, with more knowledge about Lore than ever, Space Marine 2 looks like a double gift down from heaven;An unconditional love letter not only for the old lovers of the dolls and the battles at the table, but also of those who miss the type of video games that were made at that time when the important thing was to reach your target audience andDo not fill your pockets with absurd monetizations, cosmetics, refritos, rotten crossovers, all the racial and invent-sexual deployment of the great average American city and other postmodernist garbage.

Space Marine offers us a campaign that 15 years ago would be considered another of the pile of great quality playable experiences, but that is unfortunately a breath of fresh air in an industry that is increasingly cannibaling itself and constantly bites the handThat puts food on your table.
Additionally, it offers 6 extra missions from a group of parallel marines in which you can customize your own personal spots with the colors of the chapter, weapons and armor that you want, while offering infinite rejugability by uploading each of the very different classes.

Finally and also important, Space Marine 2 offers us an experienced player against a somewhat limited player, with a couple of maps and a pair of ways, in which a sea side faces another from Marines del Chaos by theGalactic supremacy.Although with signs to be expanded in the future, this mode offers a very satisfactory gameplay drinking from the traditional multiplayer arcade -type Call of Dutyto see Niky Minaj or Messi sausages in a servoarmadura.

To put the icing on such a juicy cake, the company's very CEO left a comment in an Asmongold video pointing its fed up with the despair of corporations for introducing moralistic policies in their products and advocated a future in which video games returnTo be like yesteryear, designed to enjoy and appeal to his audience and not to serve her.

Space Marine 2 feels like a game of 10 years ago- an affirmation that ten years ago would have a negative nuance but today, in the middle of 2024, unfortunately it is music for the ears of all those who enjoy the medium as conceived.

Highly recommended.",2024/10/3,es

Positive points:
+ Very good quality graphics
+ Dynamic and aggressive gameplay, offering a real feeling of power, with a good dose of gore
+ Excellent soundtrack

Negative points:
- few missions available
- Some missions are too long for my taste: they can last more than 45 minutes to 1 hour.I would have preferred that they were divided into two shorter missions, because it is not practical when you don't have as much time in front of you.
- Bestiary and slightly limited arsenal
- Too many unnecessary interactions, like those to do just to get into an elevator
- enemies shots pass through certain objects
- The difficulty could be better balanced: instead of simply increasing the HP of enemies, transforming them into real ball sponges, it would have been more judicious to increase their number and their variety.(it's very badly thought out when you face several powerful, spaced enemies, which shoot you at a distance)

Edorian,0,14.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Edorian/,"Wide as a puddle, deep as the same puddle, with more padding than a Primaris Power Armor, and yet only amounting to an 8-10 hour campaign with maybe 4 hours of actual gameplay.

Please don't buy this at full price.

This would be quite a neat, if dragging, experience for 15 bucks. Asking for 60, or even 90 or 100 bucks for this is, frankly, insulting and shows how desperate people are for good a 40k experience. Sadly, this one ain't it.

For what's actually in the campaign:

You're jumping in the role of a grumpy, whinging, military door technician role playing as one of the Emperor's Chosen. During your fights with all of 8 types of enemies the game has on offer, next to its 3 bosses, your main job is pressing door opening buttons waiting for elevators.

Combat difficulty mostly revolves around avoiding getting pelted by ranged combat damage while trying to get into melee range, where the spectacular takedown animations and the mini-cutscene camera work really shines. Melee combat is covered by invulnerability and regeneration granted by these extended animations, i-frames during dodges, and a parry window wider than the greatest stained-glass displays in the Cathedrals of Terra.

Between combat encounters, you're walking down narrow, samey corridors with a ton of buttons and objective markers. There is always one way forward and one little side area, sometimes two, that contain an extra med pack, ammo pack and combat boosts. But don't fear, there will be an objective marker at the ready telling you the way forward, and which button to press for the next line of stiff dialog.

The campaign is a formulaic low engagement spectacle, dragging from vista to vista, where the characters in the cutscenes get to have a lot more fun and do way cooler things than what you're allowed to do in game.

Your “always ready for coop” group of 3 Marines, with our main character Primaries Marine, the flanked the jealous upstart that we'll grow to love over the course of the move and the placeholder personality and is also around for other to say lines at.

These are not the transhuman weapons of destruction, sworn to the will of the Emperor, and imbued with their 22 or 19 gene-seed organs respectively. This is Sergeant Jake McMuricaMan and his squabbling Band of Brothers, more devoted to human infighting about rank and questing orders than to carry forward the will of the Emperor in their Call of Duty. The plot might as well stem from one of these shooters.

The combat loop, when the game actually hands over controls to you, is split up 2 to 4 minute encounters in a contained arena. Each fight is followed up by 3–10 minutes of walking around, watching cutscenes, holding “forward” while more drooling placeholder dialog dribbles as you press some elevator button, and then finally arriving at the next small combat scene. But not before you're promoted to press the ATTENTION button to make sure you're not missing the highly scripted vista waiting for you. This Disneyland approach to level design can work out great for spectacle fighters, or depending on the difficulty you pick, walking simulators, but falls flat here as there is no overarching narrative or story being progressed. Just another power generator that needs turning on, another door that needs opening, another obstacle to walk around. All while the most impactful and coolest moments of the story happen off-screen.

The fact that the avoided having chest high walls and a cover bottom is the only concession made to modern game design on display. This small grace helped it feel at least a bit like 40k and not like the Gears of War cover shooter it felt like most of the time. You still get your fill of invisible walls blocking your every movement while the game is busy acting out its budget Hollywood movie that you get in the way with your desire to play it. Most of the areas could as well be wrapped up in yellow and black “STORYLINE — DO NOT CROSS” tape.

Now take your Medal of Honor and leave, Doorfighter of Ultramar.

---

Oh wait, we also shipped with Multiplayer! As all game executives of the 00'ths have taught us: Every shooter needs a multiplayer!

Multiplayer during the campaign seamlessly replaces one of your AI companions with a player. A neat system that, apart from some net code issues leading to desync and teleporting, works most of the time. Post campaign PvE content then is replaying 6 pieces sliced from campaign maps over and over again to gain XP to level up each of the 6 classes. All in all, a very simplified version of coop games like Warhammer 40k: Darktide, Deep Rock Galactic or Helldivers. While it feels thrown in to justify the horrendously overpriced experience, it does allow for a more combat focused experience with fewer story exposition and waiting segments, which is welcome.",2024/9/30,en
