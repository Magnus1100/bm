TowardEson,0,41,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198364924021/,"First of all, if you are a player who watched to buy, then my suggestion is: Don't buy it, at least this is the case at this stage.
If you are a war hammer fan, I will recommend you to buy as appropriate, but if you are not a fans of war hammers at all, then repeat the first sentence.

In this game, I mainly play Jianwei (completely unlocked). In this version of this version, it is basically one of the clown, and I can only play as auxiliary.My evaluation is only based on the play experience of Jianwei.

So why don't I recommend buying?

In the beginning of the version, Jian Wei was undoubtedly a lot of sky, fighting back on brainless bombs, and it was really cool to provide teammates with blood recovery and resurrection services.
If the production team does not want to balance it, then I will recommend you to buy it.

First, the player's mobility is too bad.
Big Brother, this is Astart, not Ogrin, who is wearing heavy armor, you are running faster than the mortal in the game. Is this appropriate?The dark tide superman next door runs faster than your so -called Old E God.No matter which version, this is a problem that I have been talking about. Many big maps, you are not running fast, the only use is to use it on the way to run.Hongru, the bullet is full.

The second point is also the most important point. The production team is mentally retarded, especially in terms of balance.

Someone may spray, oh, it is obvious that you are too simple at first, and it is difficult to come.
He ordered the church, we want the strong to the strong, that is, three powerful Astarts to play the same strong sea of ​​battles, not you cut everyone into old, weak, sick and disabledCut with bugs.

There are too many places to change the disgusting people in terms of balance, here is one by one.

First, most of the actions of Jianwei can be canceled afterwards. Now it is gone. When you are doing thousands of children, you have to be careful to make a move. He is afraid that people can do not dry you directly for a red circle.

Second, the dodge of invincible frames shorten and the judgment of the attack is shortened. What do you change this B gadget? I ask?Do you think the player is so comfortable, right?Have you ever experienced the current game?Do you use one -third of your Orgarin's IQ to think about it, is this too supermodel?Yes, very supermodel, where is the supermodel?Because except for fighting back, all of them are waste!You can only flash against the unstoppable red circle!You can definitely flash one -on -one, what about the sea?You roll off the invincible frames, as long as you want to eat damage as soon as you roll, then I will also play a cow.

Third, when I talk about this back, I am angry. Do you know why everyone has no brain counterattack?It's because the melee damage you designed is really true!Very tm low!I cut 3 sets that it is better to play a high damage once, isn't it a buddy, are you gangsters who are gangsters to force and fear and abuse?Have you considered why players have formed these play?You can lay down to sleep at this cut. If you accidentally find you to find your teeth.

Fourth, you say a balanced, and the surface is adjusted. In fact, your bright and secret reforms are not known.The first three problems seem to be within your expectations, right?If you want to repeat the super earth, just say.
Take remote, my sword guard is really afraid of remote, especially when fighting, you can't hold the shield all the time?Do you can't stop the gun behind, right?You said that you have reduced the hit rate of bullets during melee, and what is the result?When I approached the enemy to play close -up war, your B monsters are unwilling to melee, just to shoot a gun with a face with a face, your TM orange predecessor is ""as long as this distance, you can’t escape it!"" YesThe hit rate is reduced. The hit rate on TM's face is not low. My TM full blood sword sword guard N5 was evaporated by a bug directly.Dao Lie Fire, what do you let me do?Give you a shield for you?Do you move that pig's mind, is this a balance that people can think of?

In summary, the balance of disgusting people and the almost failed designs caused by balance.

Also, your production capacity is low enough, the original god is 10,000 times higher than your production capacity.

I like this game very much. Astart is really handsome. Titus's story is also worthy of talked about it, but that's it.

In this game, purely borrowed the light of the war hammer, embroidered the pillow rotten grass bag, and could not see it.",2024/11/5,zh-cn

Plus add problems with disconections due to server issues. Thought this should be fixed by now but its been 2 months since the release and i still got disconected every 1-2 hour.

ArthurKong,1,86.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198816063713/,"Warhammer Space Marine 2, it was for me the best game I played in recent years.Not because it is a game that tries to have a complex plot or something that tries to reach all audiences and end up pleasing anyone.This game tries and managed to propose to be simply a fun game.It has a companion, PVP and PVE mode and you will have fun with any of them.

The campaign is short, but it doesn't mean it's bad, because amount is not quality, few games have achieved a long and good campaign and are memorable to this day.The campaign has beginning, middle and end, well explained and with characters that will teach you through actions important values ​​for your real life, such as honor, duty and sacrifice (and for the most religious the importance of faith in your master/Salvador).The campaign has a natural difficulty that you can't be able to continue.

I didn't play PVP much enough just to get the achievements, but I had a lot of fun PVP is unbalanced only that the fun is that it is not pay to win, everyone has access to the same weapons, classes and so on.Maps well built and easy to memorize and play.

PVE is a show apart with operations that is co-reported with the campaign, very challenging Boss Fights, well-balanced and distinct levels of difficulties, each class you choose has a completely distinct gameplay built and skills.

What surprised me in this game was the relationship of the community with the developers where, everything is being resolved as quickly and fairly possible without fan service or something.

Space Marine 2 is an AAA pearl, for those who were unbelieving with the game market, this game is the solution.I met the Warhammer universe because I made new friends and after a long time away from multiplayer games I found one where it is healthy to invest my time.

Addendum to original submission, due to outrage from Inquisitorial conclave.
-----------------------------------
Let us review the game as a whole (newest update included):
Story:
Excellent, although it seems that some footage from several servo-skulls went missing.
Low initial mission count, supplemented by same number of operations (meant for multiplayer)
Score: 6/10

Visuals:
Relay congratulations to the Artists, Remeberancers and the Tech-Priests.
Score: 10/10

Lore:
As it should be. Personal note: Not sure why a race such as the *Redacted* would have a device that actively empowers warp rifts.
Score: 9/10

Connectivity:
Needs polish. It seems sudden and unpredictable Warp-storms are causing havoc with the Astropathic choir. Sometimes the Astronomican is barely visible.
Battle-Brothers are losing connection and are unable to join their squads, which is endangering mission continuity.
Score: 5/10

Multiplayer:
PvE element fun and satisfying. With several inconsistencies which currently appear to been worked on.
Score: 6/10

PvP element. Found an archeo-tech note which reads ""Not Great, Not Terrible""
Score: *Redacted*

Customization for Space Marines:
It would seem that members of *Redacted* have stolen most other Space Marine Chapters actual Gear.
For now it seems that the Tech-Priests are repainting Ultramarine's armor and presenting it as other Chapters armor. Level of heresy is high, but acceptable until actual armor pieces are found.
Score: 4/10

Summation: Game is good and developers should be praised for what they have created.
With enough polish and additional work it would be an Excellent game. However there are several questionable decisions on release which probably are related to business decisions for content which require to be further scrutinized.
Final score 6.5/10
Original recommendation: Yes

Post-Update Review
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is my take on the current situation of the game:
- New Level - Very Good
Level design is great, new Bio-Titan is Awesome

- New Difficulty - Report to the Inquisition -
New Enraged status for Majoris is good;

Cohesion ""Leash"" - bordering on Heresy- Snipers, Heavies, Vanguards and especially Assault are getting penalized for their play style. The first too are supposed to be in the back providing fire support, the other two are supposed to be in the tick of it. -
Recommendation: Rethink the design, perhaps based on what classes do best and how they can compliment each other. Positive reinforcement is better than negative.
Examples:
Knife in the Dark -

When the Sniper and the Vanguard are in Proximity range knife damage and/or speed and/or cleaving is increased

Overlapping fields of Fire -
When the Heavy and the Tactical are in close proximity, bolt weapons damage is increased for both Marines.

There! That one! -
When the Tactical and the Sniper are in close proximity Sniper Riles deals significantly more damage to Auxpex Scanned enemies

Thunder and Fury -
When the Assault and Bulwark are in close proximity power weapons deal more damage and/or have increased attack speed

Fangs of Fenris -
When two Marines are in close proximity Chain weapons have increased cleave and/or damage

Shield against the Filth -
When the heavy and the Bulwark are in close proximity the The Iron Halo becomes a sphere and has increased ranged

Downtime after death - High Heresy -
Recommendation: For an action pack game where every second counts 120 seconds should be the absolute maximum no matter what new difficulty is introduced.


Balance changes - High Heresy -
Armor changes - Seems good.
Ammo changes - Seems good.
Recommendation: Reconsider some nerfs except the Tactical's scanner, buff the under-performing weapons instead.

Report submitted to Chief Interrogator.
Until the Heresy Levels are lowered recommendation for the game is a NO.

Warhammer was never a fan, but here I thought that the game became very meme and popular and decided to buy it.The price of course - the toad is strangling, but honestly did not regret the money spent at all, moreover, he gave two more friends.So after a long time I can roll out a full review

Plot

It is nice that to understand the plot to be a waja fan is completely optional, in principle, everything is already extremely clear, especially for a person who plus minus saw a couple of memes with a waja and decided to buy the game.However, I will not say that the plot was wildly impressed or made to the core - but in my opinion there is no need for me.The game is a cross between the Duma and Kveik, in fact, in view of this, with its task, to demonstrate to us the most detailed carpencies of xenos, it copes perfectly, I do not think that you need something more.Although, of course, there is not enough good soundtrack, in my opinion something in the style of the Duma would be very out of place.The campaign itself recalls those times when single games were simple and good, without any homesproof or complex morals.Unfortunately, the passage itself occupies only Kolo 10 hours, and in general, as such, the campaign is not very difficult, especially if you go in coopeous even on the highest difficulties.

Multiplayer

The most pleased the operations in which I lingered for a long time.Firstly, a fairly wide selection of weapons and classes with different abilities with the possibility of pumping everything and everything.Secondly, the levels of difficulties where the highest difficulties can really represent a challenge.It is unfortunate that they removed the mechanics from mortal complexity, in which the armor was not restored if you were not far from the detachment - in my opinion, after this change it became too easy to play (given that I went on this complexity almost all operations in its still old form).Otherwise, here you can, in principle, linger for a hundred, play with friends, kill xenos.
As for PVP - it is, in principle, not bad, but there is no variety of modes, and I personally do not really like PVP with high TTK.In a word - for an amateur.Limited customization for chaosites is upset compared to the Imperials - I hope in the future they will add much more.


In general, the game is recommended for purchase, regardless of whether you are a warster fan or not.If I bought doom 2016, do not hesitate, buy it.",2024/11/4,ru

shokakuprprpr,0,100.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198245079406/,"The following are some personal shattered thoughts based on the play experience, which only represents personal opinions.
I first released the standard version of the player, because I am my understanding and interest in the 40K worldview, pulling my friends into the pit.Because it is played for the purpose of PVE, before the first difficulty, you can brush all the occupations to level 25 and have at least one set of sacred equipment before the first difficulty.
Personally feel at the initial version.The difficulty mainly comes from excessive damage of the enemy and the lack of medical supplies, but most of the occupations have additional recovery methods such as hot melt/grenade, laser excessive treatment or skills, although it limits the diversification of the installation and part of the game part of the game part of the game.Fun, but with the freshness of different equipment and occupations, there is still a certain gaming experience.At the same time, because it is a new game, I personally think that in subsequent updates, some more weak weapons or occupations will be adjusted.
And the balance brought by the subsequent update. I think it is a good update. Although excessive treatment is repaired as a bug, a series of weakening of the enemy's weakening of the enemy and the change of the mobs back of the mobs have also increased to players.Tolerant, at the same time, make some original career (jail: do not CUE) also have the fun of the game.This also makes me look forward to the update of the second season.
However, 10.17's update cannot be said to be very failed, it can only be said that relying on the structure.After the update, I played three online games with my friends, and I made three single brushes myself.
First of all, talk about one of the new mechanisms of the new version of the new version of the N5 difficulty. After leaving the teammates, a series of recovery of the armor does not take effect after leaving the teammates.Methods, but the designer of the military knife gives a short distance as the cerebellum hemiplegia. A sudden thorns when the melee character is underway, which will be rushed out of the distance, which directly leads to ""melee professions want melee"" and ""remote.If the occupation wants to output a relatively few places "", the armor will not be able to return. Unless your team compositions as a whole combat or a full remote, at least one player will be inIn the state, even teaming with friends will not have a good game experience.
If N5 is a challenging difficulty for a few players and has a certain reason for the poor balance, the next change will also affect the first four difficulties that have already had a certain good experience.
Update the decrease in armor, N3 -10%, N4 -20%. This change makes the player's blood volume fault tolerance rate back to the level before the version enhancement.Originally, players like me should have a little impact, but the changes in the monster mechanism below to make the game experience have been stepped down.
Secondly, the change of the monster mechanism. After the change of monster mechanism changes, the number of elite monsters has significantly improved. Taking N3.N4's purgatory as an example, the casual one on the road may be brushed out of about 10 and one at the same time at the same time.The pile of elite monsters, and the frequency of the attack of remote monsters has been greatly strengthened due to the huge number of quantities.If the melee monster can still rely on the skilled bomb to be unparalleled in the strange pile, then the long -range monster is as disgusting as throwing shit on your face.Elites close to the number of two hands are remotely playing the ""iron wire"" restrictions and standing piles on the ground. Some of them are unwilling from time to time, and some are constantly firing scattered bullets for suppression.Try to use melee, the cut targets are delayed at the back and delayed time.As for remote shooting, except for OP weapons such as grenades and plasma, it is even more impossible to win the strange sea in the blood.The armor mentioned above is reduced. In conjunction with the production team, the money who issued the resources issued by the medical package was left to the mother to buy the ashes to cause the suppliers to be too small.Missing fault tolerance and injury have further decreased the experience.
In addition, the melee damage of melee weapons that exists at the time of sale can only be damaged by the fight against the fight.Melee weapons charge damage to this kind of almost no use method to perfunctory, which greatly reduces my enthusiasm for the game.
Overall, my evaluation of the current version is: can play, but it is not necessary.
As a player who loves 40K IP, I can wait for the update with less content. I hope that the game can be better and better.But for the fool's sword, I just want to say that I play this game because it is 40K IP. You Saber stepped on a horses and shit.Don't play your own game like WG and BVVD next door?Can you see what you want?Where is the place where the balance is perfunctory, and then a bunch of rotten trials to visit the player bottom line?2024/10/19/1: 30",2024/10/18,zh-cn

Mathazzar,1,114.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972499254/,"Edit 10/28/2024 - Patch 4.0 rolled back some of the..worst changes. However, Chaos is still incredibly unfun to fight for the below reasons. They mention things like win percentages, but I wonder if that's Chaos and Tyranid missions lumped together. The buffs to bolters are..lackluster. They still remain the option for someone wanting to shoot themselves in the foot. I'll mark it recommended but hestitantly.

I won't lie. It was pretty bearable at release but.. I don't really know what the devs are doing in regards to balance and I don't think they know either. Everything I'm about to write is taken from someone who runs 90% difficulty 4 of 5 (Ruthless) and has their survivor helmet from the Lethal (5/5) missions. And this is all for PVE only.

They've done balance passes nerfing the damage on weapons when most of the weapons are already pretty bad.

Chaos majoris are the examplars of this poor design. They can teleport around in an instant. You will need to do about a dozen or two full melee combos to down them but, they can teleport away without warning.

The flamer chaos marines are the worst of the worst. They can teleport without warning in the middle of your combo, charge up a dodge only attack while you're still in an animation that you can't animation cancel out of, and reduce your armor and a good chunk of your HP near instantly. Even if they don't teleport, your dodge roll is shorter than the AOE ring you need to flee from but you won't have time to do the second dodge roll before you're hit. They have incredible range but that doesn't matter because, again, they can teleport to you.

And you may think the answer is a gun. But because the guns have been near nerfed into the ground - you will need to spend multiple magazines per marine.

And they did do a patch that made fighting chaos ... not so bad. And then immediately rolled that back partially and amped up the grind by making us worse at fighting into it.

Today we had another patch that reversed said changes, and after playing for a few hours, I can honestly say that Space Marine 2 is back in a good position again. This is of course subjective, but I am clearly not alone having this viewpoint.

In its current state SM2 is gory, engaging, testosteronie- filled fun. I usually stick to various RPG, and haven't really enjoyed a shooter (if you can even call it that) since Battlefield 1942.

I can't stop playing this though.

You have a campaign, which takes about 7 hour'ish to complete. While that might sound short, it is highly entertaining. The quality is top notch. At least I was having a blast blasting, hacking and swordchainsaw'ing my way through it.

Than you have the online part. As someone who is generally burned out of online games, this still has hooked me. You have PvE coop missions, called operations, where you and 2 fellow Space Marines clear out 1 of 7 maps. You can chose between 5 difficulties. The lowest one being very easy, the hardest one .. well.. hard.

This is my years Baldurs Gate 3. Totally different genres, but both are game of the year content for me.

Their daily active players dropped off sharply after that. Saber has now done the exact same thing that Arrowhead did.

Substantial difficulty is now harder than Ruthless was before the patch with all the Extremis spawns and other tweaks. Ruthless and Lethal difficulties are inaccessible to someone like me who doesn't have the time to no-life the game and ""git gud."" That leaves me without the ability to progress, and without that I have no incentive to continue playing.

It was fun while it lasted. It's too bad this trend of Dark Souls difficulty fetishism is ruining games. What used to be recreational fun time is now far too intense and serious business. No thanks. I already have a difficult and stressful day job. I don't want or need a difficult and stressful game. I'm too old for that and I'd bet a lot of other 40k fans are, too.

Edit: Todays patch was almost everything I could have hoped for. Saber has proven (at least for now) that they actually listen to their customers and care more about whether we have fun than making sure their game is a torturously difficult Elitists Only gatekeeper circle **** like Helldivers 2 became. The rapid response and decision to roll back poorly designed and hastily implemented changes, with a few reasonable caveats, is appropriate and has returned the game to a state of play that is accessible enough to be inviting and enjoyable and challenging enough to be replayable. With that, Space Marine 2 has earned my positive review and recommendation, but I want to leave off my revised review with some words of caution:

Part of my afformentioned stressful job involves data analysis. Space Marine 2 is a great game that was almost ruined by poor decision making based on what I can only describe as poor analysis. Dmitriy Grigorenko, the Space Marine 2 Game Director, says in the 4.1 patch notes, ""Here was our reasoning before Patch 4.0: When the game came out in September, the Ruthless difficulty win rate hovered around 60%. Weeks later, and with the changes introduced by Patch 3.0, we saw that the same win rate had jumped to over 80%, and we received a lot of feedback stating that the game had become too easy—even at its maximum difficulty (at the time)."" Okay. Win Rate by Difficulty alone is a terrible way to determine whether or not a game is unbalanced unless you are also tracking the overall played time of the specific players involved, the weapons they are using, and the degrees and extents to which they've upgraded their class and weapon perks. Of course win rates on Ruthless jumped by 20% over a few weeks! The players were learning the game, learning the enemies, learning where all the equipment spawns, and progressively unlocking more powerful weapons and abilities! A full team of maxed out players (level 25 with fully upgraded Relic weapons) with over 100 hours played consistently beating the game on the highest difficulty should not be surprising or concerning. It should be expected. On the other hand, a full team of newer players leveling and unlocking their first class and weapon set should find it challenging, but not impossible. Saber seems to have looked at and listened to only the most hardcore addicted players and started tuning the game for that small but vocal group of presumably unemployed extreme gamers who compulsively devoured what was meant to be hundreds of hours of content and then whined when the game we were all still learning and progressing through wasn't hard enough for them anymore after they memorized and mastered every aspect of a game that most of the player base were just beginning to explore. As a result, Saber made PvE progression for newer and more casual players impossible (or at least prohibitively difficult) for a week. That's a really dumb thing for a smart team of developers to do.

I don't know how much data Saber is collecting or the different ways that they may or may not be analyzing that data, but this bit of insight from the Game Director is concerning without additional context. At least they did the right thing by rolling back their and they didn't take forever to do it. Hopefully they will make good on their promise to be more measured in their approach to balancing the game going forward by listening to feedback from more than just the most hyper-aggressive terminally-online game junkies.",2024/10/19,en
BluEdge,0,194.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198155191960/,"The Developers have zero respect for their player base, they treat us as test subjects not customers. What is this patch 4.0? Are you seriously punishing your player base for having fun and enjoying the game from before? Are trying to role-play a Greek God?

1. You stealth nerfed the dodge distance and invulnerability window, now my space marine felt like he is overweight and hasn't exercise in years. The distance traveled felt unnatural even to the naked eye, its like my character hit an invisible wall as he jumped. The fact that the Developers kept this from us is a big red flag.

2. The new teammate distance mechanic on ruthless and lethal has never been tested before release, you can tell they never take snipers into consideration at all, how can they play their role as range support if they cannot stay back and provide cover fire. And why implement this to ruthless, if you want to provide a challenge for the elites among us, this mechanic should only be in lethal difficult if ever. This is clearly Hubris on the Developers part, and the success of Space Marine 2 have gone to their head.

3. Your current Operation enemy director is not functioning as intended, enemy spawn rate is all over the place even on low difficult. 6 to 7 Majoris drowning a single level 1 to 3 player on Minimal is crazy (I have encounter this multiple times when joining a game). How are new players able to learn if they are getting hammered from the very beginning.

4. Enemies are still able to shoot at my feet and damage me through the elevator floor, imagine getting sniped from underneath the floor plate by a Tyranid 5 secs after the elevator has already left the previous floor. This has been an issue from day one, 4 patches in and still not fix. I do not wish to dodge around like an idiot in the elevator, so how about you fix this immersion breaking bug asap.

5. Lastly I am extremely disappointed with the cosmetic rewards for clearing all 7 missions on lethal. One helmet for all 6 classes? Why not one for each class, the design on that helmet took your team how long to make? An hour? Two? You could have move that damaged look to all of the relic helmets, one for each class, how lazy have you gotten, I have already purchase the season pass, unfortunately in this case, honestly i don't think I will be getting my money's worth if this is the amount of effort for such an achievement.

First, it's nice to find the universe in a big budget game.Indeed, since the setbacks of the last Dawn of War, the big productions were chilly.
On the other hand, there have been lots of games with small budgets or indeed which are nuggets.

Graphics level, it's really very beautiful.I don't have much to say more, the visual of the universe has nothing to prove.

On the technical side, it is really very greedy in processor resources, I had trouble at the start.
i5-8600k
7900XT
16GB RAM

Before the last patch, my i5 could no longer.I still observed the effectiveness of the game cache system, bravo the devs.Indeed, the more I played, the less I had performance problems.However, I had many crashes at some point by playing multi.

Gameplay level, it is a return in the years pre 2015. It will not suit everyone, but the recipe is effective.
There is the same spirit as the first, but well improved.I think of the executions that are enjoyable, dodge, parade, shot and reflex parade.Everything comes naturally.The arsenal is quite generous.

History level, it is in line with the first, epic, even really very epic at times.Good W40K, what!

Content level, we stay in modern games that make bets to hold or bring the players back over a year.So the basic content may seem moderately abundant.

The multi I only did the coop operations and frankly, it's really nice to play.
I think the game will last me for a few months, even the year, given the content announced.

For weak points.Having played the game since early access, I would say:

- Bugs are boring, we repeat: do not play at the exit.
- A repetitive aspect in the gameplay: if you don't like, go your way.
- The output of late patches and features, I think of the ultra-wide support.
- We want more.",2024/10/20,fr

I'm convinced the game is single handedly being held up by the fact that it's a 40k game alone. If it were any other franchise it would have tanked day one. The game was already in a state that desperately needed changes and buffs, but instead they just nerfed the players to ♥♥♥♥. The coherency feature is just godawful and makes absolutely no sense in this game. Your forced to either stay with your ranged team mates on melee classes, or stay with your melee team mates on ranged classes. Forget about splitting up to more efficiently complete objectives or to flank enemies. Most classes have perk options that are obsolete and never worth taking. The game was advertised as a hack and slash type horde game, but the game punishes you for using a hack and slash style. The enemies are all reactive to you, so any time you start swinging your melee weapon or shooting, they are interrupting you with attacks, which you then need to dodge or parry, and while you're being swarmed in melee, there are 10 ranged gaunts and 5 majoris with devourers peppering down your armour, which you won't get back if you aren't within 5 feet from one of your team mates now, and then every 100 meters you travel you have to deal with an extremis encounter of some sort on top of all of that. The whole game is like a souls game fight, except with additional enemies. You make one mistake, you're downed. I thought this was Space Marines, not Space Guardsmen. Only 17% of the player base has actually completed an operations mission on ruthless, but somehow the devs think the game was ""too easy""?

Highway_Crossing_Frog?,1,196.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973470717/,"I'm not a Souls-like player and I usually gravitate towards the medium difficulty settings of a game. So when I tell you that I find this game highly satisfying for the challenge it provides, take that as you will.

There are 3 primary game modes:

1) Campaign. The campaign is fun, but rather short. The game itself is highly cinematic, so it feels HIGHLY cinematic in the best way. Recommended to play with friends, as the bots are fairly incompetent when you need them most (the most annoying enemies, the mini bosses, and the bosses). There is very little replayability here, as none of the unlocking or leveling mechanisms in the other parts of the game apply to the campaign and it's very linear. But there are some amazing moments that I will literally never forget, so I recommend playing it.

2) Operations. This is a PVE setting somewhat akin to L4D or Darktide that I find to be the meat and potatoes of the game. On the scale of a lifetime gamer who does not revel in the hardest games or bragging about how good I am at hard games, I found this game mode to be VERY challenging. Here more than anywhere else, you will be forced to play a certain way in order to thrive. That said, the feeling of accomplishment I get out of winning rounds at the highest difficulties is very good, and there are a ton of crunchy weapon leveling mechanisms and class perks to fine tune.

A recent patch was released with some amazing free content, but also with a significant difficulty spike that catered to a loud minority of players. More than a mere difficulty spike, it sought to increase difficulty by making the player less effective rather than making the enemy more dangerous (it did some of both to be fair). The result for me was that I almost quit the game. Fortunately, the devs listened to the community outcry and reversed many of the changes in record time. To me the game still has not fully been returned to its former state of perfect balance, but I'm optimistic for future patches. Class and weapon balance is severely lacking (only 2 classes have effective ranged defenses, making the other 4 classes highly ineffective against the Chaos faction, which is heavily focused on range attacks for example). Still, on the balance, all difficulties are beatable and this game mode is fun and rewarding. When I need to let off steam, there is little more satisfying than parrying, pummeling down, and executing a Tyranid warrior or Lictor.

3) PVP. I'm not a huge PVP guy but I've played a few hours of it. I found it rather simplistic. You will play as a space marine or chaos marine, at random. Strangely, the incredible depth of customization that is available to your space marines is NOT available to you if you happen to get assigned Chaos Marines. There is a separate leveling mechanic in PVP vs PVE, which felt dissatisfying to me when I gave it a try after 100 hours of PVE.

Overall, this is a great game with a lot of flaws, deeply satisfying and often frustrating. The devs really listen to the community, which, as long as they don't revert to catering to the self-titled ""hardcore"" minority, can only lead to more positive growth.

Maybe, if we're really really lucky, we'll even get to play as Terminators one day.",2024/10/21,en

The campaign is short, but within the enough for the game proposal.With beginning, middle and end, it presents with memorable bases its characters.Its PVE is related to the campaign and stands out for being very challenging at higher levels.

Already the PVP, at least during the time I played, was a show apart.Extremely fun and no frills.All game modes are well done.

Perhaps the only negative point of this game is the lack of a soundtrack that made it even more unique in a pattern market.Definitely, Space Marine 2 is not here to please the pasta.Your only proposal is to be fun, and in this regard it is highly recommended.

Achievements/100%: Your 100% has nothing complicated, most will be farm.A highlight for the '' merciless '' achievement that can be the great hindrance to the compleitents in the future, over time it may be difficult to make the sequence of slaughtering PVP without dying.The achievement '' end with them '' it is recommended not to mark campaign enemies in operations mode (there is a possibility of not accounting for the enemy in Operations mode).As for the conquest of default 41k of enemies, there is a glitch in the very easy campaign to make this amount in a short time.

Patch 3.0 changed the armor to work like you would expect, an extended health bar, and vastly improved the bots and made them actually do something.

The update and optimization of the game should not bring players a better experience code?Why is the game update more stuck and unstable than before.There are some settings that make me unbearable.
In the first point, level 4, and fifth level difficulties, why must I leave all the players and walk together. I am obviously the Star Warrior 2, not the three -person trio of the war hammer version.Many weapons and skills mechanisms must open their distance with teammates in the battle and provide cross -firepower.For example: the plasma weapons of the special warriors and the laser of sniper.The huge body shape of Star Warriors can easily stop teammates' gun lines.There is also the jumping backpack of the assault soldiers. His professional positioning must go to the back of the enemy to strike the key target. Once you get out of the team, you lose the bonus.I am very fortunate that you did not turn on your friendly injury mode.

The second point, weapon problems, the main weapons of various shotguns are obviously so weak, and few players will choose it as a combat weapon, but instead as entertainment firearms.This is not loyal.My magazines are empty.What is the significance of this weapon, paying tribute to tradition should exist.It is hoped that the designer can consider my proposal carefully and strengthen the explosive weapons. Don't be so useless.

Third, you still have to talk about the stability of the server. It may trigger a drop or collapse in one or two hours.The victory that was about to get into the instantly turned into a bubble, as the only last monk in the team's hope in the team.Directly lead to the failure of the battle.Everyone is not a sage who is in the heart, and the sky is not shocked.Are you testing the player's blood pressure?Summary in one sentence: disgusting!Too disgusting!IntersectionIntersection

The fourth point, the designers and the game production team, don't try to teach all players to play games, will you really play the game you made?The last dead PVE game team was called Jelldivers2.He pulled all the players a big shit, and the body that has been sprayed now has no complexion, and changed back to the previous settings (honest).Do you want to re -engraving its failure, I would like to call it Wolong and Phoenix.

Seth Brogan,0,42.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sethamphetamemes/,"Campaign was good, graphics good, story good, operations good, pvp good. But I have one major issue with the game's progression of difficulty. Its feigned, or poorly executed.

TL;DR: Game felt good at first, but as you progress in difficulty, it loses it's shine.. The game's enemies don't increase in number, rather they increase in health as you go up in difficulty, so the enemies are spongier, not harder. This paired with the mechanics of survival on higher difficulty ruined the game for me.

Full explanation:

Instead of throwing more enemies at you, or more variety, they just make the enemies spongier, (give them more health and resistance to stagger.) Same enemy, same moves. Just now it takes 2-3 mags of ammo, instead of 1. Guns feel under powered/useless at higher difficulties.

On the 1st or the 2nd difficulty, you feel like an Astartes, you feel powerful. You charge into combat, your teammates don't need constant supervision. Your weapons feel powerful. Knock it up to 3 difficulty, everything still feels good, weapons are okay, but melee seems more effective.

You hit difficulty 4, all of a sudden your guns feel pretty weak, even gold tier, max perked weapons. Dumping full mags into enemies skulls, and having to reload before they give an execute window. Enemy attacks can nearly wipe your health bar, with one hit. (Speaking about Majoris/Extremis here, the small enemies are never really a huge issue, even on max diffy). Juggling armor charges becomes a chore.

Playing on 5's isn't even playing the same game. No longer do you feel like an Astartes charging into combat, now you're literally just running around scrounging for life stem's and looking for the ever scarce ammo,(which is now even more limited with caps on uses), for a gun that feels useless. All of this while probably roll spamming to wait for your teammates re-spawn timer. This was 9/10 of my 5's, just running for your life, while praying your teammates are doing the same and not dying.

Final Take:

Game was a blast for 40 hours, but if I gotta play like a b!$%# to play on the higher difficulty, that's not fun. Ill still play a 3-4 with friends, but it feels like a chore as I know this game is gonna end up in the uninstalled folder after month or two.",2024/11/8,en

Pros:

Excellent graphics and design, people working on the environment, weapons and armor are great fellows, Ehe

Good animations of weapons of near and long -range combat, characters and bosses (especially in the campaign).

The story campaign was OK, but the general tonality of what was happening was not felt seriously or gloomy.

The coop is good, everything except the bad balance pleases me.Especially pleased with the recently added 7 mission.

PVP did not touch, but its presence as additional content is also pleasing.

Cons:

Deadly balance of complexity - we will simply make mobs 400% fatter.
The overwhelming part of the long -range weapons shoots with peas, regardless of the level of rarity.A person who decided that boltgars should apply scanty damage, have a huge scatter and still throw limited ammunition on top - are you normal?The damage of near-fighting weapons on elite enemies also raises questions, although 10 strokes (not a mini-boss) are not as annoyed by the enemy as 30 shots to the head to a state of finishing, which very much harms the sensation of shooting.

The terrible mixing of sound - the sounds themselves are not bad, but due to mixing in them there is no impact and ""juiciness"".

Slothing soundtrack, which is inferior even to the first part.This is especially true for music during the battle, when some kind of baking or hammer blows, fixed 10 times.The title theme is just a generic without charisma, who is not terrible, but is also forgotten immediately after pressing the “start the game”.Embent on the battle barge ""OK"", but no more.

cello523,0,208.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048106189/,"Love this game, but the latest patch has significantly lessened the enjoyment for me.

Specifically, the latest mechanic that requires your character to be in close proximity to your teammates in order to both regenerate armor (after ~25s of taking no damage) or regain armor through combat (parries/gun strikes/executions), absolutely needs to be adjusted or removed entirely.

This mechanic is currently broken (or at least I hope it is not intended to be this way) when you are the last survivor in your squad. The game does not allow you to regenerate armor, PERIOD. Good luck trying to survive an enemy wave on Lethal difficulty for 300s as you wait for team to re-spawn. It should be turned off when you are the sole survivor.

I swear the distance required to be considered within range of your squad is shorter than the distance I can throw a Melta Bomb. It also seems like the 25s armor regeneration timer resets if you happen to step out of that range. This can cause you to be without armor for what seems like minutes at a time, even if there is no enemies around. You can only pray your brothers don't just run off while your back is turned to them because you're Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palming a massive Tyranid wave trying to survive.

Sniper gameplay is significantly impacted by this change. It's hard to gain line-of-sight of ranged enemies or maintain safe positioning away from enemies when you're required to be within spitting distance of your team.",2024/10/22,en

While having some fundamental changes to the mechanics, the core is still there - and the additions / changes don't remove anything; in fact it contributes to the power fantasy. With practice and dedication - and some nice Relic weapons, you can wade through Lethal like it's your first time doing Substantial.

The graphics are awesome, attention to lore is fantastic, and the overall feel of the game gives you a level of immersion I haven't had in ages. Some mentioned this is a reminder of what we've lost, but look at what's been found.

Relic's done a pretty decent job so far handling the community, and their responsiveness and willingness to engage is a great predictor for the future of this game.

I don't have time for 4000 hours to drop into this game as I got university and a job to upkeep. I play games to relax. This is not what I want outta SM2. Sure add another difficulty bar, make higher levels higher and more difficult, that is fine. This doesn't mean you should make the other lower levels harder just because you felt like it. This is not the way to make a good game, this makes people hate it.

Industry-wide people hate the everloving crap outta nerfs, especially in co-op PVE shooters. Helldivers 2 is an excellent example. They had extreme nerfs which caused people top recoil and despise it, only to return when Arrowhead released the mother of all buffs to win back player loyalty. And it worked, maybe not a whole lot, but its a step in the right direction and what you need to do as well.

Nerfs are never the answer, making a game increasingly punishing for casuals isn't either. This is your Helldivers moment, Saber, don't ♥♥♥♥ this up.

Cordic,0,84.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198194856986/,"Balancing is a big issue. Weapons are way to weak to be used in a Power Fantasy world. Recent updates show the Saber Devs did not hear the community and are taking the same path the Devs did with Helldivers2 and this will kill the community just like it did with Hellsdivers2. Nerfing weapons and grenades, parry, was not needed and the game is even less fun now. Still no way to regen health which is critical because Armour does not protect the character that much at all, so health regen is sorely missed from the first Space Marine game. Some (most) weapons like All Bolter weapons are specificly way to weak, in lore these are the main weapons for a Space Marine and they are not properly represented here at all ( add Plasma is not proper either ).

Still can not freely choose the class we want to play because the Devs limited the class to one of each per match ( So stupid to put limits on what class people can choose to play and to force them to change is unexceptable ). This is a huge problem for me as it just seems wrong to do this.

We have to go through 4 loadings screens before actually entering the game. All games need to just stop this, seriously. Then leaving a match there are several loading screen that also can not be skipped. So when you try to get into a match and you have to back out because someone else is playing the class you want to play as, you have a ton of loading screens to go through and then back through, just to try and get into a match.

Space Marine 2 is few in flaws and has plentiful amounts of awesome sections and details. The gameplay in Campaign and Operations feels very smooth and highly responsive. Control inputs won't force you to lock into an animation while fighting, so you can be swinging a melee combo one moment and in the middle of that press key to parry an enemy, and the animation will snap smoothly to parrying from what you were doing earlier.
Visually game is very impressive as well! I only spotted one pop-in in 18 hours and one model missing in Battle Barge (which was fixed by forcing a reload of environments). Some of the architecture in Battle Barge and Hive City is up to par when compared to what we got in Space Marine 1 and it was also stunning sometimes to walk around and admire the scenery developers had come up with.
Voice acting is perfect! It took me a few moments to get used to Titus' voice but it wasn't long when I was able to identify Chairon and Gadriel also while fighting Tyranids.
From acting I should move on to writing: as a lore nerd I found this game to be a great representation of canon lore, I felt a sense of brotherhood with Chairon and Gadriel, some dialogue made me genuinely laugh out loud and the final boss had couple of line deliveries that really worked for me (""pearls of wisdom"" bit etc.).

Lord of Languish,0,52.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005883151/,"I would rate this a 4/10. The short version is this game is not worth $60. It just feels like an early access game with a lot of balancing issues, problems with the AI, and seemingly detached devs They rolled back their unpopular update and are establishing public test servers. There may be hope yet!

Recommended only if you are either a hardcore gamer or only want to do pvp.

Pros:
-Great graphics
-Cool executions
-The audio is immersive
-A lot of armor customization options
-The devs seem to appreciate Warhammer and try to stay true to its lore.
-Story is well done

Cons:
-Braindead AI in operations (maybe the worst I've seen in the past decade). I really cannot stress how awful they are with the sniper-bot being borderline an enemy.
-The AI don't seem to level or change based off your level or difficulty
- Bolt weapons are trash for the most part The devs have increased the damage of the bolt weapons by about 10-15%. Have to test.
-Tyranids call for reinforcements from across the zone, absurdly quickly, and still soak multiple headshots without flinching
-The operations are not consistent in difficulty. I could play average difficulty 3 times and get 3 vastly different experiences in challenge level
-
-Devs are slow to update anything meaningful
-Devs apparently don't seem to communicate on server maintenance. My wife and I were literally at the last health bar of the heldrake and we were disconnected.
-It's borderline impossible to complete the harder difficulties by yourself with said braindead ai without cheesing which is a problem considering weapon upgrades are locked behind finding armory data at these difficulties.
-Probably just my opinion but the Chaos are just boring to fight. They stand around and shoot and that's about it. I know they're supposed to be husks for Tzeentch but they can't take cover? Or use any basic tactics like using high ground or covering their allies?
-A bug I've encountered a lot was my wife would choose Assault (for example), her character would show up on the plane as she had it, then when she would load into the map, she would be a different class.",2024/10/20,en

What would the emperor approve?

The design of everything
It's just fantastic!What titanic work was the developers put on cards, armor, weapons.Just bravo!At some eye levels, it is difficult to tear off from the local beauties!Very beautiful graphics and most importantly everything is optimized (literally, from the very early access)!
And in customization of cosmodes you can abyss with your head.

You balance between your neighbor and a long battle, you dodge, parry and finish very colorfully.
It’s just that everything is thoughtlessly crumbling on the right and it will not work on the left, but it does not turn into hardcore tactics either.It turned out something average, what is needed in order to believe in what is happening and feel the power of cosmodes.
I also liked the special operations (the local analogue of the coop outside the plot), where all classes make it possible to feel the game in different ways.
From gameplay and what is happening on the meat screen, you really are bastard!


He just eats ... nothing special, although they put the potential of classes and pumping.Cards hacks, like modes.TTK is very high, the registration of shots suffers, kill you and you and you.It is very uninteresting to play, but a pity.I understand that the game is not designed for this, but I think so: you need to evaluate everything that gives the product.

Well, very briefly.The plot goes straight quickly, then only special operations and quality.

- Catcans and panoramas are well -haired, atmospheric and epic.
- The actors of the voice acting tried well.The voice acting is high -quality, even though they did not guess with the sound of a bolter.

Cons:
- Too short for your price tag.In eleven hours, you will slowly pass the campaign and all the PVE mission.
- Grind in Leitheim - for pumping one class, a couple of dozen passes of PVE missions will be required, which after Patch 4.0 are only seven.
- The crumpled presentation of the plot in the campaign.Due to the brevity of dialogs and insufficient exposure, the behavior of two hundred-year-old men looks like children's tangrums.
- Disgusting balance - most of the weapons are extremely ineffective, two -thirds of the perks are useless, half of the classes are very inferior to the other in effectiveness.

Campaing are awesome even if it's just changed Space Marine original campaing.
Like Orks => Tyranids, Nemiroth legion => Thoused sons. LoL.

Ops at first month were cool it was a challenge to master all classes and unlock all avaible weapon and until devs drops patch 4.0 game had some problems but after all problems were are just get stronger.
-Enemies are bulllet sponges and Bolts (That are Mini-Rockets with high armorpiering potention) feels like .22LR on high difficualties cause enemy HP got x4 modifiers but many bolt weapon had only 2-2.5 DMG that just a joke
-Zoantopes became just flying fortreses that can instanly kill you even if you dodge it in right timing. And don't even try to take cover from beam devs think it's good idea to make them go through any obsticale.
-Chaos is just BORING. Fight against ranged enemies with pea-shooter while yjey use .50BMG with Inferno modifiers. This is just a bad joke.
-Ping issue also made ops are more stupid on higher difficulties (on ruthless and lethal we got -35% dodge invulnerability and perfect dodge windows)

PvP also got good potention and again Saber just abondon this gamemode for 3 months.
-No new maps
-No new gamemodes.
-No balance chages (Only nerfs good weapon)
-No shuffle teams after match that makes it's very unbalanced

Right now devs goes into silence and not respond on any community questions. And for me we must be heard and try to make it game a masterpiece of Warhammer 40K franchise but now it's not deserve any praises and rewards like GOTY because game is too far from it.",2024/10/19,en

Why is the assessment of negative. All, it is simply impossible to give a neutral assessment or well silt is bad.
But it is neutral.
What I liked in the game.
-Dear shooter, good shooting.
-Disy finishing and juicy meat (if you understand what I mean). Also, chaosites are good, although many complain that they are conflicting in them. Re -read the ENT thousands or look and everything will be engaged in itself. They have more meat in the form of heretics and ordinary peoplexenos.
-Det sound and music.
-Paphos company for all covenants of Warhammer 40,000. Continuing overcoming ""Captain Titki of the Order of Supovars with a toilet theme.""
Continuation of the service of the cosmessor Dymmetry Titus in the name of the possessor and his Order of Cosmodesant Ultramarinov.Rubikon's tires and elevation to primaryis, etc.
-The painful environment and immersion in the gloomy world of the universe.
-The good mission of the mission complementing the plot after the silt during the passage of the main company.
Well, for me, everything is pleasant for me.
And that is why this review is still neutral-negative (or neutral).
-This content that is in the game can be passed in 30 hours. At the maximum complexity, if you run to the minimum.
-Ity PVP and balance in it. Seriously cards and modes, the cat cried.
-Balance of weapons, well, Christmas trees of sticks, bolter weapons are, likely, microopracts (micro and a small aoya should be like me and the number of bolts in the head 2-3 for a special purpose).I need to put 20 bolts in the head of chaosite so that it falls into the knockout. At the 5th complexity, this nichrome is not ridiculous. Moreover, he feels a cheat Bree and Hevy Bolt Gan. (Well, we don’t take a crooked weapon from the GP).Normally bolt weapons are played with a soldier with teranids becauseThrough the ausospesx perk there is a backlight when retorting and the damage increases in the head, the chaosites almost do not give you such an opportunity.
-Balance of crews for chaos. When 2 terminators roll out the entire Tim with volleys of missiles and do not react to the damage flying in them (they just do not care)
-The new enemy (biotin). Do you yourself are not ashamed? This is not a new enemy, even as a boss he is wretched. As a mechanic and mechanics of its destruction. I would understand if they added a mini-boss or especially enemy with some mechanics, but it's simpleshame.
-Disconnexes through the battle.The inability to be awarded to the game with which you threw you.Connection to the server is not the first time.
-This is mine, although who knows. I could make space -sizantnikika from Deathwatch and realized that heraldry is not on all orders for the right shoulder man. Yes, and the differences between other orders are very sparingly represented. It is complicated to make a salamandra, there are no heraldry, skins, etc.Some even amuse some (this is certainly a personal matter of everyone), but the space wolf (according to the colors of the armor of the soldier)) in the regalia of ultramarine causes only laughter.
-In ping as in PVP and PVP.
-Bagonal class of the attack aircraft who can die from his own jump.

Azrek,0,63.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004429967/,"I want to like the game, I really do. It just seems very flashy with no substance. Some of the kills or combos are great, but beyond that there are only 7 maps which play pretty much the same over any over again.

Customization of your guy ranges from a Bolter that does no damage, but fires fast to a bolter that does a slight bit more damage but fires slower to stabby bits which are either dull, weak, or useless. You will have moments where you feel powerful then go back to dumping 49 bolter rounds into 1 enemy who then proceeds to murder you completely unaffected by the weapon.

You cannot interrupt enemy attacks, moves, or critical strikes, but they can interrupt yours. The best thing to do is use the Codex Astartes approved front flip instead of movement because it makes you practically immune to all damage and you can't outrun anything anyway. I recall reading this in much of the lore on how Horus kept front flipping to get away from Sanguinius till he saw 1 opening to win. It is like having the high ground except you look silly. 90 enemies shooting at you? Front flip till you get behind cover! Melee guys all over you? Front flip away till your team can help you. I believe this move was covered in Chapter 27 of the Codex Astartes to include perfect form, how to properly tuck in your belly, as well as not get your giant nuclear backpack to get stuck on rocks.

Your Emperor approved Power armor is great except occasionally you'll get tangled up in those weeds in your garden you can't seem to eradicate or random dudes firing flashlights at you to great effect. It makes you wonder how some Astartes can become veterans as it seems everything can hurt us greatly. ""I fought in 100 campaigns! I was the first one shot in each mission and had to rest behind a rock till it was over, now I am the Captain because everyone else died 20 seconds later screaming something about glory. They made really attractive corpses though.""

I suppose the game has some potential, though it isn't as customization as Darktide, Rogue Trader or Daemonhunter. Most the Astartes will look the same though in different colors. Or your weapons look like they belong in a BDSM dungeon you have to sign a waiver for to get access.

After this first update where the developers doubled down on nerfing stuff and buffing absolutely nothing, introducing a new difficulty where everything is tankier, in a game where the enemies already felt like bullet sponges... I really cannot reccomend it for the amount of content it offers at the moment.

The combat when you look at it is pretty shallow and at high level of play there's three usable classes in PVE with one good weapon, the rest are literally unusable as they deal too little damage. The entire melee weapon roster is underpowered, in a game where melee is supposed to be the focus of the combat system.
(You can literally look up the datamined DPS values of weapons and compare them yourself.)

Half the class roster feels like it's filled with useless perks that activate on very conditional triggers and the PVP is an unbalanced mess that is already getting swarmed by cheaters.

If you really love warhammer then it might still be a worthy purchase, but honestly I regret spending money for a 12 hours long campaign that has no replayability whatsoever, coupled with multiplayer modes that also offer no replayability or reward. (other than unlocking new colours for your space marines, wohoo!)

Some heavy hits are almost impossible to dodge (like the chaos marine's flame circle) and at times I get cornered and can't see because my camera's in the wall.

The bots are EXTREMELY BAD. Not only do they not target enemies half the time, but they have no abilities. Just have the bots copy whatever perks you have for that class at least. Enemy bots also focus attacks only on the player if you're unfortunate enough to play alone. Zoanthropes are almost impossible to kill when you have 2 bot teammates and only have a pistol and melee weapon (I was in a public game as Assault and my friend DCed and no one joined).

Instead of pulling a Helldivers move and nerfing the viable/fun weapons, make the other weapons better. The blocking perk feels useless and it takes too long to kill majoris enemies with melee weapons without a parry. As a heavy main I don't ever use the heavy plasma incinerator as it's slow, doesn't do enough damage against majoris+, heats up quick, and takes too long to charge. The other weapons fare much better, but then they nerfed the melta rifle, which I felt never did much damage to extremis+ enemies and requires you to get close while aiming, putting you at a much higher risk.

I don't get how a chaos marine can shoot me point blank as I'm slashing his face.

When choosing a mission, there should be an option to host or join a random squad.

Nerfing the Melta bomb by 70% against bosses defeats the point of it. Hitting that melta is hard and should feel very rewarding.

This game is playing out almost exactly like Helldivers did for me. It was fun, I felt badass, it was rewarding to know patterns, then they hit the game with a bunch of terrible nerfs and made the game more stress than fun and ruined the flow. I haven't played Helldivers much since and I'm starting to feel the same here. What Warhammer should do which Helldivers did right was that instead of making enemies tankier, they threw more at you.

WiseGuy,1,364.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wiseguy99/,"Review has been edited to reflect the recent changes made at time of writing. To see the original negative review, check the bottom of this review.

Well I'll be damned. They actually managed to dial back enough changes to make the game a blast to play again. Combined with the new buffs to bolt weapons and friendly AI damage against bosses, I can safely say that this game has earned its place back among my go-to games to play. I still have a few gripes, like how the AI uses its abilities (or doesn't) at inconvenient times, but they are ultimately outweighed by the enjoyment of the game-play itself. I can't wait for the new weapon and what else is to come in the future. As long as they aren't updates like Patch 4.



Original review:

I used to love this game to bits, and the Operations mode was something I would play daily. However, the recent patch has made the mode practically unplayable on higher difficulties. Many minutes are wasted by slogging through a mission with wave upon wave of Warriors spamming projectiles at me, only to die near the end when the game decides I don't deserve to be rewarded for my time and kills me by sending 15 Warriors and a pair of Zoanthropes.

Helldivers 2 showed you how badly you can ♥♥♥♥ up a game when you decide to make it harder when it is already plenty difficult, and Saber Interactive decided to follow it as a tutorial. Ironically, Helldivers 2 is now it a better position than this game, and so I may decide to spend my time with it instead. Very disappointing.",2024/10/20,en

1. It is not a mechanism that people can come up with far away. I have to stand with my teammates with my teammates?
2. If the content is not enough, it is difficult to pile. N4 and N5 are the gap between cliff -like. N4 is killed casually. N5 can not be hit without shields and grenades.
3. Fix your error report and the problem of the server drop. If you do n’t encounter three times a night, I think it ’s the emperor blessed me.
4. The most classic Star Warrior is the shotgun and chain sawing sword. A good guy burst a shotgun to hit a magazine. It is not as good as a grenade.I can crack, I seem to see it in a strong place
5. Sniper ammunition is not enough, and the tide cannot be cleared and the elite cannot be cleared. The only role is to kill brain insects. Now you have to stand in the strange pile with your teammates to return to the armor.Do you really play games?
6. Playing N5 Jia is the same as paper, and you have to stand together to return to the armor. Then the problem comes. All the long -range monsters are like a Wendica assassin.IntersectionTo cut it for a long time and cut it out, you have to get rid of his teammates and take a risk to take a bath in the risk. Melof -combat damage is not as good as remote. It is better to delete melee.

The last update that introduced the lethal difficulty is great and I do not see much sense in complaints, it is a very difficult way for those who want to play in a very difficult way, there is all the other difficulties for the case you want something quieter, but still rewardand give you a satisfactory progress.
Incredible PVP, once again, transports me to the Golden Time from the beginning of the multiplayer games.

By the emperor, this is a good ol game but be warned. the machine spirit embeded In this game is quite paticulair.

My cogitator is of quite high standards with an 4080 super and a Ryzen 7 9700, but still the machine spirit seaces to co-operate and crashes out doing the most mundane tasks like loading up a save file. not even the fixes given by other tech-priests seem to calm the machine spirit down.

with great sadness this game is unplayable for me now. still I'd recomend for who's game does work it is a might pice of art..",2024/10/19,en

In short, I recommend this game, I liked it and I do not regret the money spent.
Disclaimer.In the review, an amateurish attitude towards the universe, simple mistakes, etc. may be traced.This is due to the fact that I am simply interested in the universe and solvent to buy this game and high.There is no desire to plunge in detail into the universe, although it is cool.
And then let's go in more detail.
For some reason, it was precisely for this game that I wanted to leave a review, since the game is not quite clear.
Let's start with some context.I am not an ardent fan of Wahi, with some details of the Universe I am familiar, but those of the vidos on YouTube :) I have not read books, I played a little from the games in Boltgun and Inquisitor - Martyr.
But the universe is pretty to me.I also played a quite a lot into the past creation of Saber, wwz (to which there will be references in this review).
Let's start with a brief review of the game, based on my subjective perception:
Pros:
- The game is a beautiful, very pleasant visual design.The location design is simply amazing.The cities of the hives, directly are admired, for everything is just huge.
- The atmosphere is perfectly conveyed.The gloomy 40s of the millennium, in the universe where the war lasts forever, is just transmitted perfectly.
- Respect and love for the universe.It is felt that the developers really respect this universe.Because even under the hardest control from Games Workshop, you can make a low -quality product, the benefit of such varnish games that are a lot of Steam on the bottom.As an example: according to the plot, one of the secondary fighting brothers receives a severe wound and throughout the plot, somewhere in the background of the hub he is prepared to become a dreadnought.
-Himepley against tyranids.I really like to fight these opponents.Moderately complex, there are a lot of them and enjoy the coolness of your character.It is felt that we are perfectly weapons in the hands of the emperor of mankind.
-I really liked the chip with the separation of the campaign and the PVE missions.From the point of view of the narrative, they go in parallel.
-PVE mission, they are also operations.In fact, I bought the game only because of this mode.Since I like wwz, then I expected approximately the following:
Classes with unique abilities and weapons, crowds of enemies and coop.I got all this and is generally satisfied.Well, pumping, I like this aspect that you play for something.
Cons:
-Sester state of the game.I do not know what exactly happens, but it happens that it throws out of the game, does not connect to the lobby.Not so often happens, but when it happens wildly infuriates.Such a problem was in WWZ, so I got used to this problem a little.
-Himepley against heretics. This is not a minus right, I just noticed that of all the operations, I play only in those where tiranids are opponents.The gameplay against heretics becomes more tactical, so you have to switch from the berserker regime.
-Thisly minus, this is a balance.Apparently the core of the game was implemented operations.For there the balance of opponents and classes is simply perfect.As for the campaign, it feels that it is made using the same approach, only you do not have classes and does not pump the weapon, which sometimes raises questions.
-Covering the PVE of missions until you go through the plot.Well, this is a minus personally for me, as I bought a game for the sake of operations with friends, I immediately had to go through the plot.Such a small restriction was slightly disappointed.
Summing up a brief resume through this game:
This is a magnificent game in the Warhammer universe.Probably the best in which I played.And just a good game with your nuances.Do not buy it thinking that she is just like HELLDIVERS 2, these are completely different games that give completely different emotions.If you like games with progression, excellent visual style and a minimum entry threshold, then this game is for you.If for various reasons you do not have much time for games, and you love them, then this game will certainly give you excellent emotions.Especially if you play it 1-2 hours a day.Just to relax.Want to get a call, you can simply go to higher levels of complexity.I definitely recommend this game to buy.I specifically do not pay attention to the price, because everything is now expensive and while you think about whether this game is worth your money, you just won’t get the right pleasure.So try to immediately forget about how much you spent on it.",2024/10/18,ru

It's not even the ridiculous nerfs.. You showed us so much and gave us so little.. we were all expecting new armour and weapons and you gave us nothing. No reason to continue to play? What is the point of playing PVE and PVP without leaderboards, armour-tiers, titles? Accolades? anything?! Instead, we got what was gradually being called a repetitive game become MORE repetitive..
