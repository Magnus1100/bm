Dootslayer,1,173.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050419580/,"Listen brothers! I have waited more than 10 years for this game.
And by the emperor it delivered...with some minor flaws.

When the first trailer came out it hit most Space Marine fans as a huge surprise since nobody
ever expected a sequel to finally arrive myself included, but oh boy we can be all thankful that it did because it's a blast!

I will create a mini section for the 3 main parts of the game, which are the following: The story mode, the co-op operations and PvP.

Let's start with the campaign:
What is your craft? Death.

It's a little bit on the shorter side but it's quite a ride. I try to remain spoiler free , so you can experience it for yourselves.
The gameplay is a mix of the original space marine paired with the horde system with tyranids and it works wonder for this game.
In the early game, depending on the difficulty you picked might feel slightly weak, but:
1) It's required for a healthy gameplay progression (By the middle, you'll feel a lot more potent with the gear you have, and at the end you'll be straight overpowered with a certain weapon combo), and don't forget that tyranids can rip through Astartes especially Warriors.

There is also a surprise enemy later on, which most of you'll probably expect, but it managed to be something new, a faction we never seen in a 40K game before. A breath of fresh air, a welcome change, you'll see.

I'd recommend taking it slow on the ship and taking in the ambience and mini events that happen between missions, they are 40K perfected. The devs clearly had passion and care about the source material.

And the final level: You are going to love it if you like Warhammer. It starts on a high momentum and keeps going and going until the very end. The boardroom meeting about it must have been like: ""How much hype do you want during the last 2 hours?"" ""Yes.""

So yeah, the story mode is roughly 7-8 hours long depending on the difficulty you pick, but it's a ride you'll remember.



The bread and butter of the game for the devs, the mode they clearly have priority on and want to expand further during the first 4 seasons of the game.
It's a mix of Darktide (With the fixed missions that can randomise) , WWZ with it's progression system and horde mechanics, and Space Marine with it's gameplay loop.

Overally it's really solid and has longevity if you like that kind of stuff, you can upgrade your characters and wargear with branching paths, and it's really really fun especially with friends.

There are only a few downsides as of writing this:

1) Class locks. Understandable but you can matchmake with a certain class selected and get dropped into a match in progress where you are forced to switch or quit.
2) No option to host a public lobby on your own. That's allegedly getting changed ""soon"". We'll see.
3) Balance. The balance is fine for the most part, there is only one black sheep , the assault class. It's rather weak, or simply doesn't have it's proper plance among the 6 mainline classes. It needs some slight love.



Not much to say, it gives you vibes of a game that's from 2012...but that's a good thing. You have 3 modes, the classic domination mode, team deathmatch and king of the hill. The TTK (Time to kill) is fast as it should be, and the matches are really fast and fun.

Balance seems fine for the most part, i'v played a lot of matches, unlocked some relic armors and never felt like anything needs a nerf. Of course it's early to tell, we have to wait until the community unlocks everything and some time passes, but so far it's solid.

There is only one big negativity when it comes to pvp: The maps. Don't get me wrong, they are good but there are only 3 maps currently in the game. They are adding more later on, but you can't help but feel like there should have been at least a few more on release.

A short summary for the end:
🟩 Pros 🟥 Cons

-An amazing campaign mode, which makes 40k come alive -That is slightly on the shorter side
-A really fun, classic vibe PVP mode -That has little map variety
-The graphics are really nice and works well with the art design -Technical issues on some systems, i had no problems
-The coop mode is a blast especially with friends.
-It's a long awaited sequel to Space Marine 1 and it delivers

If you read through all that, i would like to thank you for taking your time to do so and have a nice day dear reader!
Also thank you for Saber interactive for making such a banger of a sequel!",2024/9/10,en

 这游戏非常适合手柄操作，手柄的震动适配做的非常好，走路、战斗等等反馈都非常优秀，键鼠的按键过于奇葩，游戏体验也比手柄差很多！
 由于游戏开启需要epic验证，如果遇到问题可按以下方法尝试解决

1.卡epic服务更新:关闭游戏和steam;打开加速器的epic加速;在windows的任务管理器里面搜索epic进程并全部关掉;再打开steam检查游戏完整性;点启动游戏，重新更新epic online service进游戏。
2.epic服务更新完成仍然打不开游戏:进入游戏的安装目录，直接启动“Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2”进游戏。

游戏的剧情背景紧扣在战锤40k的宏大背景之下，泰伦虫族作为一种极具侵略性并且数量庞大的外星生物对人类帝国诸多星球造成破坏，一些混沌势力也在暗中伺机而动，玩家扮演的泰图斯作为帝皇麾下的星际战士肩负保卫帝国的重任并与其展开厮杀!
游戏在视觉效果的表现上便展示出了极高的工业实力，战锤宇宙中各种科幻效果都在游戏中给足了演绎，作为《僵尸世界大战》开发商开发的又一作品，其拿手的尸潮再一次应用在了本作中，密密麻麻的泰伦虫族虫潮给足了玩家紧张于压迫感，广阔恢弘的战场视觉演绎频繁，并且切身融入到玩家的战斗中，给足玩家爽感！

游戏在玩法上保留了非常传统的线性关卡制，没有解密，也没过多的探索元素，战斗上可使用近战和远程两种武器，也都是系列熟悉的一些爆矢枪、能量武器等等，远程射击自然不必多说，但在近战方面游戏增加了不少动作机制，让玩家打的更爽，在敌人发出蓝光时，可以进行格挡，红光时候可以翻滚，完美触发时可以释放枪决，可以理解为一个慢动作高伤害技能，在敌人生命值较低时，可以触发处决，带来杀戮感极强的视觉效果。
不过处决也不仅仅是终结敌人那么简单，也是一种鼓励玩家战斗的方式，游戏中玩家护甲和生命都相对较脆，处决可快速回复护甲并且提供短暂的无敌帧，处决过程中也能触发一小部分aoe伤害，这样的设定下就很难龟缩输出，去脸对脸和虫子硬钢就是最佳选择，也是爽感的主要来源之一。

不过却也并不代表可以无脑贴脸，在面对大量虫子的时候，合理的运用翻滚格挡以及aoe伤害这些才是重中之重，不然在敌人虫海战术下被包围后血条也会消失的很快！

本作的战役部分内容并不长，7-8小时即可通关，并且传统的关卡制玩法下也并没有其他元素，所以很容易腻乏，所以多人部分才是游戏可重玩性的主要体现，游戏分为pvp和pve，通过轻微养成以及团队合作的方式增加游戏乐趣，pve模式下提供六个不同职业可选，不同职业之间有着不同的武器和技能限制，比如特种兵就无法携带近战武器，只有一把厚重的加特林配上一个护盾技能，就非常适合在后方做强火力输出。
此外局内获得的经验可以提升对应角色和武器等级，可以提升武器和人物技能，让战斗更加爽快，在游戏内容不多的情况下这样轻微的养成机制就成了游戏很好的驱动力！
不过目前联机有些问题，经常性会出现匹配进不去游戏的情况，不过根据已知的公告来看已经在修复了，应该后续会更新补丁，目前可以创建任务后直接集结，带ai队友游玩！

总的来说这是一款不错的动作射击爽游，即使不熟悉战锤宇宙，也依旧能玩的很爽，多人为主的模式下后续会保持长线运营，潜力无限！",2024/9/5,zh-cn
Poss,1,26.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014929285/,"Summary
Campaign: <15 hours of loreful hack n slash fun.
PvE: Fun with friends, but undercooked, linear and clunky
PvP: Fun with friends, but bare bones and unbalanced

I recently replayed Space Marine 1, and the sequel is a much better game. The visuals, sound and feel are all spot on for a Space Marine fantasy. However, it doesn't quite achieve everything it sets out to, and its secondary modes fall short of other similar games.

Campaign
This is very much a 40k story, with writing reminiscent of a black library novel. That is both good and bad, with the over the top sclock, bravado, action and machismo you'd expect. The grim reality of the Imperium is acknowledged, but on the whole it leans closer to glorification than critique.

The gameplay is a continuation of the first game's mechanics and feel, with chainswords and plasma guns feeling suitably impactful. It is highly linear, without meaningful choice and very little exploration. Being combat oriented and straight to the point is very Astartes, but would have grown wearisome if the campaign were any longer. The scripted executions are similarly timed to stay interesting right up to the end of the campaign, but perhaps not much longer.

There are obvious missed opportunities here. Like the vehicle levels which have placeholder cutscenes but don't let you control them, or terrain destruction which happens all around you, but you can't actually change. its also quite short, at under ten hours if you race through, or perhaps 15 if you take your time and play the optional missions as they unlock.

Still, overall it is an enjoyable romp over a couple of days

This is the bulk of the end game replayability, and the customisation will please many tabletop fans. However it has some key limitations. It doesn't have the visual depth or gunplay of Darktide, nor the endless variety and replayability of Vermintide or Left for Dead. This is a much more linear experience where you replay the same maps over and over. You do get variety from the different classes and upgrades, but progression is largely cosmetic or minor stat buffs.

Beyond the limited number of maps, skills and enemies, there are also pretty limited number of weapons, with quite a few slots having only a single option. You're likely to get dozens of hours of fun here, but maybe not hundreds. The repetition of things like execution animations which started to show in the campaign will become very clear over repeated play throughs of these levels. There is a roadmap with more content, lets hope there is enough in the pipeline to keep the juices flowing.

This is a throwback to a different kind of multiplayer, back to the days of unreal tournament or halo at a LAN party. There is a very low time to kill, and strong reliance on team coordination. There are only three maps with three game modes, so the replayability here is again limited by content availability.

PvP will be fun to play at launch, and if you have a crew together, but may struggle to drag people away from the hero shooters and mobas of the world long term.


This is a fun and brutal distraction for a few dozen hours. For some it will be a realisation of their childhood fantasy, for others it will be a gateway into an addiction they didn't know they wanted. It is a great entry into the set of warhammer games, and a worthy sequel to a fun game. It won't revolutionise the industry, but it does show that going back to basics and delivering what the fans want is a sound strategy for a good time.",2024/9/9,en

"Meat-King, The Ultimate",1,118.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968514473/,"""Blessed is the mind too small for doubt.”

Warhammer 40.000: Space Marine 2 (2024) represents a third-person hack-n-slash shooter game, developed by the company Saber Interactive and published by the company Focus Entertainment. The first instalment (2011) was developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ.



++ The campaign features the beginning of a Tyranid invasion, with all its horrors and endless tides of claws and teeth. Perfect setting for the grim dark future in which every melee execution results in a fountain of blood and guts. In the middle is our protagonist Demetrian Titus, who lets us see and experience the new story around him. That, dear reader, I consider the short-term motivation.

++ Now comes the long-term one, for the excellent integration of the cooperative modes allows us to play the campaign and secondary missions, called Operations, with up to two friends. Four difficulty levels in combination with six classes provide a broad spectrum of replayability. And for the brave, there is Eternal War mode, essentially a 6v6 PVP match that culminates in a battle between Space Marines and the Archenemy.

o What happened to the weight of the power armour? Each step of several hundred kilos of high-quality ceramite should leave an impact, yet the game does not convey the sounds or weight of it in a credible way. Just look at WH40K Boltgun for reference. What about the precision of ranged weaponry? Every time I fire several bolter shots the spread leaves me in disbelief. Any guardsman would severely doubt the marksmanship of that drunken angel of death standing next to him. What about crippling a Tyranid warrior? Unfortunately, not possible. A more detailed hit box with additional dismembering options would have been a great addition.

- Upon first launch of the game, an automatic installation of the Epic Online Services started. This constitues heresy of the highest order! The developers stated: „We can assure you that this was only implemented to support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores.“ Whatever the case, I immediately deinstalled it and the game runs just fine. And so should you, brother.

- A couple of bugs corrupted the holy binary code, e.g. floating items, delayed rendering of textures, clipping and collision issues. Saber Interactive’s tech priests have initiated counter protocols. The Omnissiah knows all, comprehends all.

-- I am shocked to witness the atrocities committed in front of my sacred codex. A simple Tyranid hormagaunt survives a bolter shot, and it takes a magazine to fell a warrior type. A fundamental misunderstanding of the technical background of the weapon. And I will not even start complaining about what they did to my dear melta and plasma weapons. Furthermore, there is a crippling imbalance between ranged and melee attacks, with the emphasis clearly on the latter. Just try to execute a warrior from 10 meters away, let me know how it went. The Inquisition has been informed of the devs’ transgressions; their punishment will be servitude in a penal legion against the greenskins on Armageddon.



The game nails the atmosphere of a Tyranid invasion, and the superb co-op gameplay allows for countless hours of playing the campaign with your battle brothers or prove your team’s tactical prowess in PVE and PVP sessions.

On the other hand, it displays some blatant lore inaccuracies and focuses more on close combat than on firearms, which completely undermines my attempts to crowd control the waves of biomass with ranged weapons. The Codex Astartes does not support this action!

Recommended for determined initiates and seasoned veterans, loyal to Roboute Guilliman, standing firm against the xenos filth in the darkest hours of the Imperium of Man.

我今天只锐评联机PVE中武器设计的糟糕表现。

当一个游戏武器数值非常失败时，表现在于。有八九种可选武器，但是玩家不得不玩其中一把。而那一把不是有多好玩，而是不玩就活不下去。

这个游戏和绝地潜兵存在一样的问题。游戏对于爆弹枪数值最失败的地方在，玩家已经不在乎制作组有没有设计出自动爆弹枪（轻机枪）和重型自动爆弹枪（重机枪）的区别了，而是整个爆弹武器枪族都被打上了‘垃圾’的烙印。

面对高难度，玩家将不得不被迫只能玩热熔武器。谁能想到，帝国精英和载具上最坚固的基石，在游戏中居然是一个连击退效果都没有，打不动敌人防御架势，几百发1吋（25mm）重爆矢才能打死一个精英怪的鸡肋？

当武士虫把双骨刀一架，直接顶着密密麻麻的重爆弹弹幕贴脸砍我时，我在疑惑我手中拿的到底是重爆矢步枪，还是星界军的卡特雷尔激光枪。要知道，爆矢是精金制作的火箭增程弹药，精金不如武士虫的骨刀硬？它凭什么连防御架势都不会破一下？

枪械射击手感方面，1英寸重爆弹设计得像.75爆弹的手感，.75爆弹手感与打击感甚至不如战锤40000：暗潮的贼配军凡人爆弹有打击感。所有为了爆弹枪而来的玩家都会因此失望，因为在这个游戏中，你们和朋友在游玩时的远程武器，只有弹容量极低的热熔武器才能帮你们活下去，选择爆矢枪就是选择辜负神皇而死。

后面我要对制作组说一说游戏模式设计问题。

联机PVE，为什么你们不设计开放地图，像绝地潜兵2一样，把我们用跳帮空投舱砸下去，给我们指定任务目标，让我们自己去完成？这不比你们设计线性地图更新要快，可玩性更高？

阿斯塔特五人跳帮舱多么经典的设计，难道制作组一次都不会让玩家体验到轨道空降？如果没有轨道空降。每次都搭乘雷鹰炮艇，我作为阿斯塔特甚至不如星界军的艾丽西亚空降兵。没有经历过轨道空降打击的阿斯塔特，配叫阿斯塔特吗？根本没有精神！",2024/9/9,zh-cn

Sum-Up
In-depth analysis further down.

Follow our Curator page, , to see more high-quality reviews regularly.
























“In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war”. A historical quote that single-handedly resumes the bleak, brutal universe of 40K; humanity spans the stars, its society on the verge of collapse and only carried by a fanatically-rooted war economy. SM1’s protagonist, Titus, returns as the main character and is sent on a mission to defend the Imperium; this time around, insect-like Tyranids and the Ruinous Powers of Chaos.

The tale of Titus and his two Ultramarine companions is lore-accurate and engaging — 40K fans will catch many references and bits a newcomer wouldn’t, but that doesn’t make it unenjoyable if you’re new to the franchise. Characters aren’t one-sided and have solid narrative depth; the feeling of being an important cog of the Imperial war machine — but a cog nonetheless — is conveyed perfectly, as it should be.

Visually and artistically, few games can equal the desolate beauty of SM2. From the enormous Tyranid swarms laying waste to all, to the iridescent distortions of Warp powers and the blasts of Cadian artillery, everything looks and sounds amazingly crisp. Settings are varied and rich in detail, with more than a few impressive landscapes. Weapon sounds, dense effects and excellent voice acting only give further emphasis to the action-packed battles you’ll engage in. The gory finisher animations, different based on the enemy faced and weapon used, add great emphasis to the destruction of tougher foes.

Maps are linear, with one path to follow once either all foes are slain, or certain objectives are completed. Still, exploring the few side-areas, nothing more than crevices or branching dead-ended paths, is worth your time. There, you’ll find precious supplies and uncommon weapons that will improve your survival chances: medkits, Relics allowing you to revive once, heavy weapons and ammunition caches. Lore-related Dataslates also can be listened to in order to better understand the events that transpired. There are no collectibles or proper secrets to mention, nor a map, which you won’t need given the fairly-simple layouts and on-demand objective markers.

The superb combat system of SM2 is articulate and skill-based, fully conveying the brutality of conflicts of such a scale and, on the higher difficulties, the lethality of Mankind’s enemies. With one melee and two ranged weapons, you’ll lay waste to all Xenos, but you’ll also need to be careful, as a few hits are all that’s needed (on the higher difficulties) to be slain. A responsive system of dodge, parry and riposte rewards timing and reflexes, restoring your armor so that your health isn’t affected — the latter only restored by special abilities or rare consumable Stimms.

Each enemy is dangerous and behaves coherently to their role, even the lesser ones pose a threat, given their sheer numbers — heavier ones, especially mini-bosses, might even one-shot you given the chance, and their endurance is superior. A substantial array of iconic weapons, from the Bolter in its variants to the mighty Thunder Hammer, Plasma Guns and the devastating Krak Grenades will all become available to you as the story progresses — they’re not infinite however, so use your ammunition wisely. SM2 encourages aggressive playstyles with its armor regen mechanics, as slaying enemies in melee with perfect parries not only will bolster your defenses and allow devastating counters, but also allow the use of your Ultimate ability, making you unstoppable and regenerate health for a short time.

Fights are high-stakes, packed with gore and exciting, with a system that is nearly-perfectly designed for this genre. Unfortunately, your companions, mighty as they may be, will be too dumb to properly assume the best positioning during defense tasks, and can’t be equipped with custom loadouts, unlike yourself. Bosses are all unique, barring a few repeating ones, and extremely difficult to overcome on the harder settings. Their tactics change as they lose health, and usually only a few hits from them spell your doom.

After the Campaign, you’ll have several Operations: PvE missions parallel to the main story that depict critical events and feature another Ultramarine team that helped Titus in the main story. Contrary to the campaign, here you'll have access to six customizable classes, each with unique loadout capabilities and Ultimate skills, other than different passive perks and weapons to unlock as you gain XP after an Operation is cleared. Experimenting with different playstyles and combinations, and upgrading your class, adds solid replay value and good progression feeling. These Operations also have progressively increasing difficulty, with better rewards, such as cosmetics, XP bonuses and so forth, proportional to the difficulty you’ll engage into — however, you won't go far in the harder difficulties without better gear and advanced perks, despite all of the settings being available from the start regardless of level.

The PvP mode, Endless War, has Chaos forces face the Space Marines in a variety of objective-based modes, ranging from the classic Deathmatch to more nuanced ones. It allows full loadout customizations just as in the PvE mode, and is a nice addition for those interested in competing against other players to test their skills.",2024/9/6,en

Не без проблем, ждем патч первого дня, но ставить негативный отзыв не имею морального права.

В ней прекрасно все. До мельчайших деталей.

Космодесантник ощущается КОСМОДЕСАНТНИКОМ. Это не обычный болванчик, а огромный генетически модифицированный МУЖИК в тяжеленной броне MK. 10, который двигается тяжелой, но уверенной поступью
Цепной меч ощущается именно так, как представляешь его, читая книги. Огромный, крошащий все на своем пути, проливающий реки крови
Болтер стреляет не обычными патронами, а именно реактивными, это чувствуется и в отдаче, и в импакте.
Разработчики буквально смогли сделать все механики такими, какими они должны быть. Высадка на планете тиранидов ощущается буквально как в книге, только красочнее, живее, и ты можешь своими собственными руками отмыться в крови ксеносов. Это воистину лучшее, во что я играл в этом году (а может быть и вообще)

Фоторежим к слову тоже отличный, можно красиво щелкать смешную нарезку тиранидов и еретиков. Мне понравилось

Из минусов я бы отметил очень сомнительный баланс в PVP, отсутствие фоторежима в коопе, и то, что к пятому часу беспрерывной игры моя 4060 потеряла половину кадров, а проц решил устроить прогрев. Но разрабы обещали патч, ждем, не вижу повода дизлайкать за это

Я пока не могу комплексно выразить все эмоции от игры, но точно могу сказать - прохождение на сложности Ангел Смерти - это не просто лучше чем соитие, это самые яркие эмоции в моей жизни

Mischief,1,145.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Travesura/,"TL;DR? Yes, I recommend this game, it's simple old school fun, some caveats here and there, regarding multiplayer, some epic shenanigans and, maybe replayability.
But if you want to have fun, it delivers.

I played the first Space Marine years ago, not when it was relaced but a few years ago, and I had fun. This game feels like coming back to that Xbox 360 era, of ""simpler"" games, you just want to burn some time, doing some bombastic and silly violence, it's perfect doing that.
You got a decent and fun to play campaign that can be played on coop with friends, (I recommend because the bots kinda suck), operations that complement the campaign, they are coop missions where you unluck experience and cosmetics, and a PVP mode.


The biggest pro's of this game, in my opinion are the gameplay, just raw fun, it can feel repetitive but, it feels so good that honestly I don't care. It can be punishing in harder difficulties but if you master the dodge and parry system you become an unstoppable killing machine.
The visuals and presentation are spectacular, from the first to the last minutes, I stopped several times to admire the work of the devs bringing to life the 40K universe, and Kudos to Saber, they did a great job. Not just representing the dark and grim aesthetic, the technical spectacle of seeing thousand of enemies on screen, the colors, particles, explosions, textures, blood. Delightful, I can say the same about the sound design and music as well.
The story is there, it's not going to blow your mind but hey, it isn't bad at all. It's a good conduct to the slaughter gameplay.

The weak points of the package, imo of course, are... maybe some optimization, lack of graphic options (ahem, FOV slider), Epic anti cheat and online services, these are kinda silly though, you can uninstall the online services if you don't want to use crossplay, and the anti cheat, well... sadly, a lot of games uses that crap, at least we don't have denuvo, thanks devs. I didn't suffer any crashes of super bad drop of performance even if my pc has some weird specs.
The gameplay can feel imprecise at some points, I'm speaking about parrying some attacks, dodging, besides of repetitive, as I said, I don't mind this, because I just enjoy how fun it is anyway.
The length of the whole package, I am happy with it but, maybe some people is expecting more content, if you see the roadmap there will be more content in the future but this isn't a life service game (thanks lord Emperor) so don't expect seasonal huge updates. Let's see how the devs manage the dlc content, I think it will be all just cosmetics but we will see...

Overall, I enjoyed this game, I had my doubts honestly, the first trailers looked too good, and after playing I can say Saber delivered a good game and a great sequel.
Thank you, after so many fiascos lately it's nice and refreshing to play a game that it's just fun, faithful to the source, made with care and dedication.

Brings you back, to Saturday evenings, with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mics and the heat hitting your back.
Weren't they the best gaming memories we have? Just raw fun.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 
A Screenshot of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2
By: ♡ Helena Meow ♡


The best part of the game:

- Performance 10/10
- Graphics
- Gameplay and all types of finishers (50 in total)
- Variety of Bosses and Enemies
- Very complete customization (Skins, colors, weapons, perks...)
- Co-op / Multiplayer and Story Mode
- Variety of Weapons & Grenades
- Soundtrack
- Cinematics (It feels like you're in a Warhammer movie)

💙

Story Mode:

During the first mission Captain Titus is ordered to carry a bomb to be launched into the atmosphere to kill all the Tyranids on the planet, but when he fails and is about to die he is demoted to Lieutenant for alleged corruption.
After being operated on he is reassigned back to the battalion, but as a Lieutenant and during this adventure he will be with his new companions Chairon and Gadriel who will accompany him on all the missions.
At the end of the campaign there is an open ending in which Titus is sent to another place temporarily which we can see in a future sequel of the game or a future DLC.

💙

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 other game modes:

- Eternal War Mode: 6 vs 6 PVP matches in 3 different game modes (Conquest, Capture and Control and Annihilation)

- Operations Mode: Co-operative Story Mode for up to 3 players that has a total of 6 missions (Recommended to play after completing the campaign)

💙

Totally recommended game without a doubt.
One of the best games I've played this year and I'm very happy with this purchase, which hasn't had any launch errors.
The 2-year wait has been worth it because they've released a game that's worth it.

Mabi[N]ogi。,1,35.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MABINOGI_Reborn/,"先说结论吧，目前不建议路人跟风，战役体验是合格的，但当前内容量不值得全价购买，联机PVE和PVP体验都不好。

1.关卡
战役演出很棒，大场面做的尤其震撼，每个怪都至少有三种以上的处决动作，屠杀小怪，撕裂精英的爽感是目前独一份的，但是仅限于低难度，一旦难度调高以后，以“弹反、闪避”为底层的动作设计和极限堆怪的关卡就会给你吃屎一般的体验，怪物刷新没有逻辑，数量多，而且是从各个方向来的，没有安全区，掩体极少，从四面八方包围你的远程小怪甚至可以穿墙射击你（可能是bug），而你低性能的远程武器和容易见底的弹药量很难隔着怪群把他们清理掉，你的韧性很差，雷锤蓄力出手都会被人一拳打飞，更不用说混在杂兵里的多只精英近战怪让你几乎没法打完一个完整的近战连段，更不要说穿插在几乎无休止怪潮里的“拯救天线”这样的任务目标，如果是带着两个不会做事的NPC那你更是痛不欲生。
另外，战役打完并不会给任何的奖励，只会解锁几个合作关卡，这使得对玩家而言战役没有任何重玩价值。而合作关卡的后面几关又十分的恶心，导致联机PVE几乎只会选择前两关，本来做好的12张图，只有2张甚至1张被玩家选择重复游玩，玩家只能在为了效率选择枯燥和为了新鲜感吃屎中二选一。

与其说是不平衡，不如说是近战和远程武器整体上的性能极差，不匹配怪物的数量与强度，枪械的定位接近于普通射击游戏的步枪冲锋枪等，但你的敌人是几刀一个星际罐头的武士虫，混沌的加特林火箭弹还会瞬移的韧狗罐头，面对他们你除了不停翻滚或者找机会弹反，在进攻端几乎没有什么有效的反制手段，目前唯一能把多个精英控到死的貌似就只有热熔枪，而爆弹枪甚至无法给精英打出任何硬直。而近战，有更高的技术水平要求，上限却是更低的。
以上原因导致在中高难度，也就是仅仅从难度2开始的PVE中，玩家的选择就十分有限，除了热熔枪，就是高伤害的狙和榴弹把怪物灌死，本应作为常规手段的自动火力和近战是完全缺位的。

目前养成系统非常简陋，PVE产出：
①职业经验→升级，点职业天赋
②武器经验→武器升级、升阶需要→武器精通后给武器天赋点数
③武器数据→用于武器升阶，与难度硬捆绑，也可以用来直接精通你不想练的武器
④货币→点职业天赋、购买武器、购买纹章配色护甲配件都需要
可以发现除了经验和货币以外，唯一产出的特殊道具就是武器数据，而武器数据很快就会溢出，一类武器升阶只需要一个，这样的系统使得玩家的目标很少而且重复，极易腻烦。所有关卡的产出都是几乎一样的，这也使玩家只会选择1-2个最轻松关卡去刷。当然我也不觉得刷词条是多好的设计，但确实缺乏多样性。
PVP唯一的养成就是获得对战经验来解锁对战等级，从而解锁各职业可以配置的武器种类。

PVP对战本身的设计只能说“一般”，就是非常普通的射击对战，而这个游戏最大的特色动作系统，在PVP中反而隐身了。
而PVP最重量级的问题是：
①没有系统！
除了对局以外，没有任何系统，没有排位，没有赛制，匹配全靠缘，只有按经验积累的玩家等级和职业等级给你看看。
②作弊！
制作组对反作弊几乎是躺平的，除了一个人见狗嫌对作弊没有一点作用的小蓝熊以外，没有任何措施！连举报按钮都没有！我甚至怀疑制作组都不会进行封号处理，PVE你们无限雷刷刷也就算了，来这图一乐的PVP里面也恶心人是吧，特别是10号普通版解锁以后，被某些一看就是来中国旅游的杂种败类隔空秒全场之后，大伙都老实了。谁能想到作弊畜生里十个有九个都是自学中文的外国友人呢。

除了中间加一点细节的过渡套装以外，每个职业只有2套外观，按场次解锁，此外可以解锁的外观少之又少，序章的套装也只有几个部位供你解锁，当前自定义的自由度基本只体现在配色上。

以我个人的配置来说，优化没有任何问题，同等水平画面的游戏也很难找到比这游戏优化更好的，40K暗潮我都需要单独调整设置才能不卡，这游戏默认设置除了电梯载图和最大波虫潮以外帧数都是稳定的，对比泄露工程版的三四十帧差异非常明显。
小问题是真的多，包括但不限于：
默认选择副显示器，你改完设置重启他还是给你默认选副显示器，只是设置里的显示器1和2调换了；
先行版第一天PVE载入不了服务器，但第二天修复了；
某些时候受击会导致人物动作卡住，卡几秒之后要翻滚才好等等……

总体而言，这个游戏质量合格并且我非常喜欢，而且问题虽多，但大部分的问题改改数值和天赋就能极大优化体验，PVE和PVP系统需要大改，特别是封号不跟上的话，这PVP谁也别想玩了。美术方面产能的缺口很大，需要新地图、新关卡、新怪物、大量新的自定义护甲，不然就只有等级可以刷了。因此这个游戏并不推荐当前全价购入，只打战役的话体验合格但只有不到十个小时的流程，想打高难度则需要一定理解和练习，如果没有正确认识盲目跟风的话只会花钱受苦。",2024/9/10,zh-cn

워해머 IP는 IP 이름 값과 팬덤 규모에 비해 판타지 세계관으로 나왔던 워해머 토탈워, 40K 세계관에서는 던 오브 워 시리즈가 한 때 흥행했을 뿐, 매번 애매한 규모나 평가로 나와 게임 관련 수난사에서 꾸준히 언급되는 IP 이다

이러한 원인으로 게임즈 워크숍의 깐깐한 판권 관련 문제 (대표적으로 다크 타이드에서 너글만 나오는 것이 대표적)와
미니어처 매출과 관련해서 게임 개발에 한 두개씩 관여하고 있다는 이야기가 해외에선 꽤나 자주 언급되는 추측이었다.

저러한 이유들로 인해 메이저 게임사들은 해당 IP 사용을 꺼리다 보니
스팀에 넘쳐나는 복합적 ~ 대체로 긍정적 게임이 양산되던 와중에

월드 워 Z로 게임 개발자체는 무난하지만 본편은 부실한 대신에 사후지원 및 운영 능력은 괜찮다고 평가를 받은 세이버 인터렉티브가 과거 렐릭이 만들었던 스페이스 마린의 후속작을 개발한다고 하였을 때 사실 기대보다는 우려가 좀 더 많았다.
월드 워 Z 본편은 출시 당시에 여러 기술적 이슈도 많았고 이후 업데이트로 여러 맵들이 추가되기 이전에는 컨텐츠가 적었기에 생각보다 길게 즐길 요소가 없었기 때문이었다.

이러한 몇몇 문제점은 이번 스페이스 마린2에 여전히 존재하는지라 아쉽지만, 그럼에도 이러한 아쉬움을 극복시킬 만한 도파민 요소가 게임에 상당하다.


1. 스페이스 마린에 어울리는 액션 연출

제작진이 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈에서 많은 영감을 받았다고 공개 당시부터 꾸준히 언급하였는데, 실제로 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈에서 볼법한 잔인하면서도 쾌감넘치는 연출과 플레이 방식을 보여주고 있다. 이러한 부분은 스페이스 마린의 케릭터성과도 잘 어울리면서 워해머 40K 세계관에도 어울리는 지라 전반적으로 개발진의 선택이 매우 뛰어나다고 볼 수 있다.
전작의 경우 일부 점프팩을 쓰는 경우 제외하면 케릭터가 묵직한 느낌이 적었는데, 이번에는 전반적으로 묵직하면서 살아있는 병기라는 느낌을 잘 살렸다고 느낀다.

2. 비주얼

지나치게 단조로웠던 전작, 스페이스 마린 1편과 달리 보다 다양한 배경을 보여주면서 게임 하는 내내 배경 보는 재미를 제공해주고, 워해머 40K 팬이라면 좋아할 디자인과 아트 스타일, 월드워 Z에서도 보여주었던 물량 연출 등 게임의 비주얼은 전반적으로 뛰어난 편.
다만 요구 성능 대비 퍼포먼스는 좀 아쉬운 편이라고 느낌.

3. 장기적으로 기대되는 운영

전작 월드 워 Z의 경우 본편에서는 상당히 컨텐츠적으로 많은 문제를 지적받았으나 이러한 문제를 지속적인 사후 지원으로 꽤나 많이 개선시켰으며, 이번 스페이스 마린2의 경우에도 장기적으로 PvE 모드 및 맵, PvP 관련해서 업데이트가 될 예정이다.
이들이 전작에서 보여주었던 사후 지원의 모습만 유지한다면 게임의 장기적인 수명에 좋은 영향을 줄 것으로 보인다.

4. 꽤나 기대 이상인 PvP

PvP 베타를 하려다가 캔슬했었기에 해외에서는 PvP에 대한 기대치가 출시 직전까지만 하더라도 박살난 상태였는데, 의외로 할만하게 뽑혔다. 현재 FPS 게임 시장을 점령하고 있는 콜 오브 듀티로 대표되는 아레나류, 카운터 스트라이크, 발로란트로 대표되는 5 vs 5 와는 조금 다른 느낌인데, 개인적으론 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈와 콜 오브 듀티의 특정 모드가 약간 쓰까진 느낌이다. 현재까지의 메타로는 무지성으로 런앤건을 하려고 하면 순식간에 죽기 일수이며 포지션에 따라 6 vs 6 대치를 적절하게 해가며 팀원들이 모여 한타하는게 주인 것으로 판단됨. 다만 밸런스 자체를 그리 신경쓰고 만든 느낌은 아닌지라 핵과 별개로 장기적으로 가기에는 조금 많이 부족하다고 느낀다.

5. 부족한 현재의 컨텐츠 및 미션 다양성

다만, 평론가의 평가도 그렇고 즐기는 사람들이 입모아 말하는 단점으로는 절대적인 컨텐츠 양 자체가 좀 적은 편이다.
캠페인 자체는 난이도에 따라 편차가 존재하지만 8~12시간 정도면 엔딩을 볼 수 있으며 출시 기준으로는 주요 PvE 컨텐츠인 작전의 맵은 6개 밖에 없다. 그리고 호드 모드 및 추가적인 PvE 컨텐츠는 추후 업데이트 예정인지라 헬다이버스2로 터져버린 PvE 파이유저층이 이를 대체할 만한 게임을 지금 당장 찾는 것이라면 부족한 컨텐츠로 조금 실망할 수 있다. PvE 게임 치고 파고들 요소는 적은데 단계별로 높아지는 난이도를 제외하면 분석하고 도전적으로 할 요소가 현재까지는 없다.

6. 은근히 체감되는 기술적인 이슈

AI가 좀 구리다는 점, 플레이 하다보면 꽤나 쉽게 버그를 찾을 수 있으며, 서버가 불안정한지 PvP나 PvE를 하다가 지연되는 경우도 상당히 많다.


전반적으로 개발사 특유의 단점, 부족한 본편 컨텐츠, 기술적인 이슈는 여전히 존재하지만
개발사가 전작 월드워 Z에서 보여준 사후지원을 생각한다면 조금 길게 봐야 할 게임으로 보이며,
IP의 매력이 뭔지 정확히 파악해서 이러한 부분으로 게임의 전반적인 설계 및 디자인을 잘 구축하여
단점을 많이 상쇄시켰다는 점에서 여타 각종 장르에서 무지성으로 양산되던 B~C급 워해머 게임과 달리
무난하게 잘뽑혔다고 느낀다.

워해머, 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈의 팬이거나
당장이라도 PvE 관련해서 도파민이 급한 유저라면 정가 구매를
만약 워해머나 기어즈 오브 워 시리즈에 문외한이면서
PvE 장르를 가볍게 즐기는 그런 유저라면 세일가로 구매하는 것이 좋아 보임.",2024/9/10,ko

EPIC联机问题

本作也采用了豪华版先行体验的形式，先一步表示忠诚也先一步接受考验，先一步体验bug，但当游戏开头出现EPIC联机服务时，确实让我提心吊胆了起来，但是还好EPIC并没有阻止我，更多的是开启就崩溃。但相信很多好兄弟仍被EPIC服务更新所困扰，给大家提供两点解决办法。
1.卡epic服务更新:关闭游戏和steam;打开加速器的epic加速;在windows的任务管理器里面搜索epic进程并全部关掉:再打开steam检查游戏完整性;点启动游戏，重新更新epic online service进游戏。
2.epic服务更新完成仍然打不开游戏:进入游戏的安装目录，直接启动""Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2”进游戏。
游戏单机的情况下的游玩体验并不算优秀，AI队友苦不堪言，并且敌人会集火于你，单人想要打高难度还是颇为困难的。最好是能找到好友一起玩，可以试试UU加速器联机，不仅能帮忙解决进游戏的问题，还能用云存档服务为你的存档保驾护航。

本作的主线剧情战役模式流程较短，普通难度下基本十来个小时就能完成主线剧情。玩家在主线剧情中将会扮演回归极限战士队列的副官德米特里安·泰图斯，带领三人小队冲锋陷阵，完成一个个不可能的任务，表达对帝皇的忠心，洗清自己的嫌疑，赢得荣耀。游戏的剧情非常不错，很纯正的一本道线性剧情，非常还原，也不会有太多谜语人之列，很清楚，即时是纯路人也能得到很好的体验，我相信系列粉丝能体会到的更是能原地高潮，游戏中也有大量原著中的彩蛋等等。更不要说本作有中字中配，中配的效果也非常不错，搭配上宏大史诗的战斗，怎一个爽字了得。
除了战役模式的主线剧情之外，本作还有六个地图的PvE行动模式，以及几个PvP模式，含有团队死和占点等经典模式。讲实话来说，游戏的内容并不算太多。

游戏中玩家能够使用的武器包括一个主武器，一把手枪和一个近战武器，当然，随着行动模式和PvP中兵种的改变能够携带的武器种类会有所不同，与战锤背景十分相衬的是游戏的中主要鼓励的攻击手段是近战，拿着链锯剑等一系列武器将敌人撕个粉碎。而在战斗中也是这样，玩家手中的远程武器的弹药量收到严重的限制，对于一般敌人来说，远程武器还稍可应对，但当面对稍微强一点的精英小兵时，近战就显得格外重要，近战攻击不仅能大范围造成伤害，对更大范围的敌人造成打击，在面对精英敌人是也同样方便进行破防等一系列操作。敌人的近战攻击大致分为三种形式，普通没有提示的攻击，更快的蓝色攻击和，不可防御的红色攻击，蓝色攻击可以通过格挡来造成硬直与伤害，会使小怪直接被处决。精英怪则会丧失三分之一的血量，游戏中精英怪的血量通常用三个格子来表示，三格打空便可进行处决，处决会恢复三格护盾。玩家承受伤害的大头也围绕护盾展开，通过枪决近战处决敌人获得护盾以达到在战斗中进行循环，而有限的远程子弹也导致玩家使用近战会获得更大的收益。
不过该说不说的是，虽然游戏中鼓励近战，但单人过剧情的话又会存在不少的远程敌人，这一点确实难受，尤其是远程脑虫，飘在天上不下来，队友又吸引不了火力，敌人只会集火你，如果躲避的话输出空间非常小而如果正面作战的话，还需要同时注意周边大量的其他小怪和精英怪，一个稍不注意，一虫一刀就给你来个重伤，可能忙活了半天结果竹篮打水一场空。尤其是高难战斗，跟爽游压根没有关系，玩家能选择的手段也较为有限。

游戏中单人部分和多人部分则是两种不同的养成方案，主线剧情基本没有养成系统，有的只是随剧情推进解锁的可使用的武器等等。而联机部分则采用了大量的肝经验进一步解锁新等级的武器，提升人物等级，从而获得一些被动技能形成build。这一部分的内容就显得较为枯燥乏味了，毕竟游戏的地图并不多，重复肝的确会让人感到厌烦。但更少的内容更显得游戏内容扎实，游戏手感扎实，枪械设计精良，刀刀砍肉的制作令人血脉喷张，基础内容扎实至少是能够爽一段时间的。",2024/9/10,zh-cn

用語解説

・コーデックス・アスタルテス(Codex Astartes)
「戦いの聖典」と翻訳されることもあるスペースマリーンの交戦規定。
内容は軍の組織や戦術など、交戦の時に参考できるマニュアルに過ぎないが、
これが作られた時代から１万年以上過ぎた今はもはや聖書みたいな扱いになる
この世界でのスペースマリーンが絶対に守らないと行けないルールみたいな感じになった

ゲームの中でタイタスが異端として告発された理由の一つが、
このアスタルテスを従わずに柔軟に行動したのも大きい。
本編でも落下する飛行機からジャンプパックで脱出しようと提案した時に
「それはアスタルテスにはないです！」と抗議するシーンがある
つまりこの世界はアスタルテスに書かれてないことをやると異端審問にかけられることがある

・アスタルテス(Astartes, adeptus astartes)
注意してほしいのは（w40kを複雑にする要素の一つでもあるが）
実はアスタルテスにはもう一つの意味を持っている。
単にアスタルテスと言う時はアデプトゥス・アスタルテスのことを意味する時があり、
これはスペースマリーン自身のことを意味してる。文脈によって解釈するしかない。

・デスウォッチ
対エイリアン特化部隊。最戦線で戦うため一番危険な任務を行う。
懲罰として送られてくるケースもよくある。
とにかく過酷で有名

・ブラックシールド
スペースマリーンの肩には出身地や身分を表示するための文章が刻まれているが、
いろんな理由により出身を隠すためにそこを黒く塗りつぶしたデスウォッチ隊員
デスウォッチが過酷でとにかく人員が必要なので出身を問わないで人を雇うための制度

つまり○○なんかみたいに、表現の規制のためのだけのローカルライズ版なんか存在しない

・アクション全般。

・epic online service
こいつのせいでよく落ちる。長時間プレイできない。
burn! epic! death to epic! 火による浄化をepicに！死をepicに！

・世界観や設定などが多いので新規ハードルが高い。
正直、世界観を知らなくて、前作やってないとストーリがわからないままで終わると思う。

Twiig,1,44.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/twiig/,"Review After 100% Achievements

Coming from someone who has little to no Warhammer 40k knowledge or experience, I had an awesome time playing through the story and operations in Space Marine 2! I just obtained all achievements after finishing the game this weekend in the early access launch period, and I’m glad to finally have this one done after grinding xp and kills for hours on hours. Space Marine 2 has pretty much three different branches of content; the Main Story Campaign, Operations (PvE), and Eternal War Mode (PvP). For me personally, the campaign was good…not bad but not great. Eternal War has potential but there isn’t a whole lot of variety with 3 maps and 3 game modes at launch….I know in the roadmap there is more planned which is great! The Operations were the highlight of my time with the game. Character customization and class progression feels killer, and I really liked the different difficulties. Visually the game looks amazing, performance wise I did have a few crashes/freezes and some connection issues when connecting to others. Crossplay worked decent during the campaign and operations, but I really wish there was a way to turn on/off cross-play in PvP since I’d love to team up with my brother who plays on his PS5. Overall, the hunt for the grindy achievements like maxing out a class or killing 41k enemies was what fueled my desire to complete this game and it feels great to add this one to the list!

Achievement Count: 50
Time to 100%: ~40hrs

加载时长令人发指，开游戏，洗个澡，喂个猫，听首歌，说不定还在加载游戏资源。但是进去了以后只要不退，都还能接受。
剧情里面，你仨正直正确人兄贵就是超人，你砍，你射，你颅献王座；

任务里面，你和剧情里的大头兵没有本质性的差别，怪物刷新逻辑简直可怕，遇到过从头至尾零星遭遇，打完最终防守/BOSS，走人；也遇到过两波武士虫+狙虫共计20只，两头夹你，打到生活不能自理。
难度曲线很迷，基本大多数典藏版老鳖都卡在第二阶武器。第三级精工要打难度3，小毛虫爆弹枪要4-5枪，而你只有180发备弹，还找不到补给，因为这也是加难度的一部分。

这三天和很多中外锤粉组过队，很多穿着圣物铠甲，拿着破刀烂枪，大家相视一笑。
你没有高级武器，你打不过；你打不过，所以你拿不到高级武器。闭环。

据现在看，我自己最喜欢的飞兵，就是个废柴，先锋兵，也是废柴，战术小队，也别想用爆弹枪，也是废柴。你只能热熔糊脸，赌上性命。你非要玩近战，那就靠BUG大佬用狙击兵带你，无限子弹无限潜行。但带出你最高级的装备，你还是啥都打不过。尴尬。
*顺带，其他武器圣物都有复数个外观，至少炫酷，飞兵最后四把圣物锤，长得一模一样，大拳套也是如此。

我锤粉了24年，结合我的专业，走上这条爱WH的路，这款游戏，比起之前的1代，进化了很多，但还是值得我骂。
很多东西诚意不够，很多超出技术层面的东西强行加入。希望以后会修吧。

shaikhulud,1,34.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shaikhulud/,"Rarely do I finish games in one sitting and Space Marine 2 is an absolute blast from start to finish. So it's a rare game from that list.

I do understand that people are struggling with some issues here, but for me it was a smooth 9 hours sailing from the main menu to the end titles bar a few toilet breaks.

Space Marine 2 is a perfect sequel like Uncharted 2 was to Uncharted 1. It is a living, breathing and brilliatntly realized vision of 40k universe in all it's gory glory and spectacular epicness. I can't find porper words to describe how perfect and true to the setting almost every detail and element is.

We've never seen WH40k universe realized with such care, fidelity and production quality. Never. This is the best WH40k media to date and the closest to the huge Warhammer 40k movie we're all dreaming about.

g_divergence,1,11.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gdiverge/,"What can I say... (Edit: A lot apparently)

From the campaign alone I think it was a solid buy.

The combat isn't mind-blowing DMC5/MGSR melee combat action awesomeness, and the shooting isn't quite as tight as more focused cover style shooters, but - and this is a big BUT - you feel like a space marine. How is that not cool?! You're a little slow, a little heavy, but you feel like a 10 foot tall dump truck ready to steamroll anything that isn't painted blue. The weapons don't have a massive amount of variety, but on some reflection, I think its acceptable. Would I have liked to see some of the more insane bits of kit for use? Sure, but that isn't really the ""I am a tactical marine that branches out a bit sometimes"" vibe that Titus gives off. (I would still kill for a terminator armor mission, to be clear.)

As far as the breadth of content goes, it took me just over 9 hours to beat the campaign on veteran, and I plan on going for max difficulty here in the near future. Was it a riveting story? No, not really. But it was good. It feels *authentic* in a way that was refreshing, like I could open just about any 40k book and find something like this in its pages. The story I think actually does itself a disservice in some ways where certain elements are underplayed or resolved a bit too quickly, but still, it had all of the beats it needed to, and a more than appropriate amount of justice to the setting to sell me on this being the actual 40k universe.

Some will see the 9 hour campaign and see that as a deal breaker. If you play on game-journalist difficulty and don't do anything but sprint from checkpoint to checkpoint, I wouldn't be surprised if you could get it as low as 7 hours. For some, 10 bucks an hour is a bad ROI, and if you don't have *any* interest in playing the PvE or PvP, then maybe that's all you'll get out of the game. But hear me out. We are often spoiled with sprawling massive games that suck you in for 100+ hours, and this isn't that. Instead, you get a meticulously, fairly challenging, hand crafted experience with what is perhaps one of the greatest fictional universes ever. That has to be worth *something* even if it means ""I'll definitely get it on sale""

To sum up:

If you are a fan of 40k or just like 3rd person action games, its an easy buy.

The only reason I would say to steer clear for now is if you expect nothing less than Elden Ring: Space Marine edition in the content department for your hard earned bucks (which, fair enough if that's you).

I look forward to grinding through the PvE content over the next week or so, and will probably even dabble in the PvP to check it out as the game gets updated over the next year, and perhaps even beyond!

เงิน 1,490 บาทกินหมูทะ สุกกี้ชุด 299 ได้ตั้ง 5 ครั้- แต่แน่นอนว่าเราจะอวยอย่างเดียวไม่ได้ คนที่จะเล่นหรือซื้อเกมโดยใช้เงินจำนวนหลักพันขนาดนี้ ความคุ้มค่าและเวลาในการเล่นต้องสำคัญแน่นอน


Space Marine 2 ความรู้สึกแรกที่ได้เห็น
ผมคิดว่า Space Marine 2 แม่งเป็นอะไรที่โคตระเท่ระเบิดเลยสำหรับคนที่ชอบแนวนี้แต่สำหรับผมนั้น ผมไม่ใช่คนที่ติดตามจักรวาลของ Warhammer 40k เลย จนกระทั่งมาเจอเกมนี้ตอนที่ผมไถหาอะไรดู จนไปเจอคลิปของ Asmongold ที่เขาดู Space Marine 2 ในวันที่ 25 พ.ค. 67 ผมคิดว่ามันเป็น Trailer ที่โครตบิดา มารดาเท่จัสๆ จากที่ผมได้ดูในวันนั้นผมก็เลยคิดว่าควรรู้ประวัติหรือ Lore ของ Space Marine ไว้หน่อยก็ดี เพื่อที่จะได้อินกับเรื่องราวของ Space Marine ในบางส่วน ผมเลยไปดูช่องของคนเล่า Lore ต่างๆ ของ และได้ถามเพื่อนที่รู้จัก Lore ของ 40k ความรู้สึกที่ได้รู้เรื่องราวก็แบบเชี่ยยยยย แม่งโครตเท่ไปเลยหว่ะ หลังจากนั้นในวันที่ 22 สิ.ค. 67 ก่อนเกมเปิดสำหรับคนพรี 2 สัปดาห์ผมเลยจัด ไปเลย ถือว่าได้สนับสนุน Developer และบอกไปในตัวเลยว่า ""เกมของคุณโครตเท่เลยนะ ผมถึงซื้อ Ultra Edition ของคุณ""



ผมคิดว่าเป็นเกมที่ผม มากและแม่ง Space Marine ไม่รู้ว่าจะโคตรเท่ระเบิดไปไห- สำหรับคนที่ไม่ได้ติดตามโลกของ แบบผมที่เพิ่งมาดู Lore หรือใครที่ได้ดูประวัติกับ Lore ของ Space Marine มาก่อนแล้วมาเล่น ผมคิดว่าน่าจะ แบบนี้แบบ และรีแอคแบบ นี่คือความรู้สึกผมที่ได้มารู้ แต่สำหรับคนอื่นน่าจะความรู้สึกคนละแบบกัน แต่ผมเล่นไม่จบบอกมากกว่านี้ไม่ได้ บอกได้แต่ความรู้สึกเพราะไปเล่นแต่ PVE



ผมตอบเลยว่า PVE ดีย์สนุก ภายใน 30 ชั่วโมงแรกเท่านั้นหลังจากนั้นคุณจะเบื่ออย่างแน่นอนผมรับประกัน เพราะว่าเมื่อคุณเล่น PVE และเลือก Class ใด Class นึงที่จะเป็น Class หลักของคุณ และคุณปลดล็อคชุดของ Class ที่คุณชอบนั้นครบ + เวลตัน, ปืนทองมีครบ, Skills Point ของปืนตันทั้ง 3 ปืนทั้งปืนหลัก, ปืนรอง, มีด คุณจะไม่มีอะไรทำแล้วเลยนอกซะจากว่า คุณจะไปเล่น Class อื่นและปลดล็อคทุกอย่าง มันก็อาจจะทำให้คุณได้ชั่วโมงเพิ่มสัก 10, 20 ชั่วโมงต่อ 1 Class ส่วนปืนบางอย่างมันก็สามารถที่จะใช้ร่วมกันได้ในบาง Class ส่วนระดับความยากของ PVE ก็มี 4 ระดับ และก็จะมีระดับความยากเพิ่มมาในอนาคต แต่เราจะพูดถึง 4 ระดับนี้ก่อนอย่างแรกก็ ถึกนิด, ถึกหน่อย, ถึกกลาง, ถึกมาก(ในระดับถึกมากนี้ของช่วยจะดร้อปให้เราน้อยลง) ระดับในอนาคตก็คงจะเป็น ถึกเชี่ยๆ ส่วนความถึกของตัวศัตรูก็ขึ้นอยู่กับระดับของปืนที่เราใช้ครับ และความยากของศัตรูก็โอเคครับ ถึงเราเก่งแต่ถ้าประมาทก็ตุยครับ


สนุกที่ได้เล่นเป็น Space Marine ที่ตัวเองอยากเป็นแบบเท่ห์ๆคูๆ

หลังจากผ่านไป 30, 40 ชั่วโมงที่คุณได้แตะ PVE คุณจะเริ่มเบื่อในทันที เพราะว่ามันจะเจอแต่อะไรซ้ำๆเดิมๆ ถึงแม้ว่าเหตุการณ์บางเหตุการณ์มันจะไม่เหมือนเดิมแบบตรงนี้ไปเร็วขึ้น, ตรงนี้ไม่มีอะไรตกลงมาเลย หรือทำไมตรงนี้ผ่านเร็วจังแต่ใน 30, 40 ชั่วโมงที่คุณเล่นคุณก็อาจจะเจอครบหมดแล้วด้วยซ้ำ มันก็ควรที่จะมี Content ให้มากกว่านี้แต่เดี๋ยวเขาอัพเดทในอนาคตต้องรอดูครับ ส่วน Level ถ้าให้ดีก็ให้เพิ่มมากกว่านี้ก็ดีครับ เพราะว่าเมื่อคุณเล่น Class ที่คุณชอบเวลตันแล้ว พอไปเล่นกับเพื่อนหรือคนอื่นๆพอคุณช่วยเขาคุณก็จะได้แค่ของไว้อัพเกรดกับเงินแค่นั้นเลยครับ เหมือนกักตุนของไว้รออัพเดทปืนใหม่หรืออะไรก็แล้วแต่ ส่วนของ EXP ก็หายจ้อยครับ คุณจะไม่ได้อีกแล้ว

ผมเล่น Class ของ Sniper ปลดล็อคชุดครบ มีปืนทอง, มีดทอง, เวลตันตะบี้ตะบันเล่นตอน Day 1 ของพรี SM2 รวม 2 วัน 30 ชั่วโมง เล่นระดับความยากครบ 4 ระดับ เล่นทั้งวันทั้งคืนยันเช้าลืมทำเควสเกม NIKKE ไป 1 วัน(นอกเรื่อง) หลังจากนั้นก็เริ่มเบื่อแล้ว ได้แต่เข้าไปเล่นช่วยคนอื่น และบอกพวกเขาว่า ""ไปเล่นระดับความยากอื่นบ้างเถอะมันไม่ยากขนาดนั้นหรอก กดไปทีไม่มีใครเล่นเลยหาห้องอย่างนาน"" ถึงเจอห้องแม่งเจอโปรวิ่งไว เจอฝรั่งระเบิด Inf, ล้มแล้วลุกเองได้, ยาไม่จำกัดด้วยโอ้โห่เข้ เจอ 2 ตาติดมึงพรีมาเล่นโปรหรอว่ะเฮ้ย เหลือจะเชื่อ ส่วนที่เหลือก็ตามที่บอกนั้นเลยครับ



แถมตอนเล่นตอนเล่นนั้นมันพลาดมันล้ม แล้วมันคงคิดว่าผมเก่งเวลตันฝีมือดีย์หลบเก่งคงมาช่วยมันได้ หลังจากนั้นผ่านไป 2 วิผมล้ม อยู่ๆแม่งลุกขึ้นมาเฉยเลย เพื่อนอีกคนล้มอยู่ใกล้กว่า แม่งไม่ชุบแม่งวิ่งมาชุบผมคนที่ล้มไกลกว่า ผ่่าดงกระสุนนับ 100 เพื่อเธอคนเดียว เลือดไม่ลดสักแอ่ะ ห้อยหลวงพ่อวัดไหนนิจะไปขอสักองค์ แม่งเป็นโมเม้นที่ฮาและปั่นจัด อยู่ๆลุกเฉย Item ชุบตัวเองก็ไม่มี แม่งไม่เก็บอะไรเลยตอนแรกนึกว่าบัค เอ้าสัตว์เอ้ยแม่งโปร



ผมไม่ได้เล่นมากแต่จะพูดถึงความรู้สึกแรกคือสนุก เหมือนเกมเดินยิงทั่วไปของตลาดเกมที่เป็นมุมมองของบุคคลที่ 3 แค่นั้นแหละได้เล่นน้อยในตอนนี้หลังจากเขียนรีวิวนี้เสร็จก็จะไปลองเล่นดูน่าจะได้ไม่เกิน 10 ชั่วโมงโดยประมาณ แต่ถ้าคนชอบก็น่าจะติดเลยครับ



ผมคิดว่ามันคุ้มค่าในราคานี้สำหรับในตอนนี้ 9 ก.ย. 67 เพราะว่าโดยรวมแล้วผมไม่เห็นถึงวี่แววที่จะได้เล่นถึง 200 ชั่วโมงเลย สำหรับผมแล้วมันยังขาด Content อะไรอีกหลายอย่าง ถ้า Plan ที่เขาบอกว่าจะมีนู้นมีนี่อัพเดทมาผมคิดว่ามันจะคุ้มในตอนนั้น แต่ในตอนนี้ 1,490 บาทมันคุ้มค่าที่สุดแล้วเกมที่ดีขนาดนี้ในราคาขนาดนี้และเท่ขนาดนี้มันโอเคแล้วส่วน และ ถ้าคุณมีกำลังทรัพในการซื้อสอง Edition นี้เพื่อจะเอาซีซั่นหรือเอาชุด ผมก็ตอบเลยว่าเอาเลยครับ มันเท่มากๆ และมันเหมาะมากที่เราจะสนับสนุน Developer ให้พัฒนาเกมแบบนี้ต่อไป และถึง Developer จะมีข้อจำกัดหลายๆอย่างในการทำ แต่ทำได้ขนาดนี้ก็เท่และสนุกมากแล้วครับ



1,490 บาทคุ้มค่าที่จะซื้อ เผลอๆคุณสามารถซื้อ Gold Edition ได้ด้วยซ้ำ หรือถ้าคุณมีตังกินหมูทะหรือสุกกี้เกิน 5 ครั้ง แถมเงินเหลืออีกงั้นก็กดซื้อ Ultra Edition เลยครับผมแนะนำอย่างแรง... คุณที่เป็นวัยทำงานแค่อยากกลับมาบ้านมาเสพเนื้อเรื่อง Campaign ของ Space Marine ก็ตอบโจทย์อยู่ไม่ใช่น้อยแต่เชื่อผมเถอะไปดูประวัติของ Space Marine หรือตัวเอก Titus มาก่อนแล้วคุณจะว้าวเหมือนผมอย่างแน่นวลหรือไม่ คุณก็เล่นเนื้อเรื่องให้หอมปากหอมคอ แล้วมาเล่น PVE เลยก็ได้ อยากจะเล่นสบายๆไม่มีเวลามาก PVE ของ Space Marine 2 ก็ตอบโจทย์เหมือนกัน วัยทำงานถือว่าคุ้มค่า Avg ของเวลารวมทุก Mode ผมให้ Avg เวลา 50 ชั่วโมง ถึง 60 ชั่วโมง ครับ ถึงจะถึงจุดอิ่มตัวเล่นเรื่อยๆไม่ถือว่าไม่เหนื่อยเกินไปสำหรับวัยทำงานแบบผมและพี่ๆเพื่อนๆทุกคนครับ. Content ยังน้อยอยู่ผมให้คะแนนแค่นี้พอถ้า ซีซั่น1, 2, 3, 4 ตาม Plan ที่เขาวางไว้มา คะแนนค่อย 9, 9.5 หรือ 10 ครับ เอาความคุ้มก่อนครับ



1,490 บาทคุ้มค่าในราคานี้นะ ไม่เหมาะกับการซื้อ Gold Edition และ Ultra Edition เลย เพราะว่าพวกคุณมีเวลาที่เล่นเกมกันเยอะมาก ไม่เหมือนวัยทำงานที่เขาแค่อยากหาความสุขในช่วงเวลาที่เขาได้พักมาเล่นเกม คุณได้เงินค่าขนมที่คุณพ่อ, คุณแม่, คุณน้า, คุณอา, คุณป้า, คุณลุง, คุณตา, คุณยาย, คุณทวด ที่เขาให้มาแล้วเอาซื้อ Gold กับ Ultra Edition นั้นมันไม่คุ้มเลยเอาแค่ Standard Edition 1,490 บาทคุ้มแล้วครับหรือบ้านรวยก็จัด Gold มาเลยครับผมแนะนำ หรือกุไม่สนก็จัด Ultra Edition เลยครับถือว่าสนับสนุน Dev. นอกเรื่องละ กลับไปที่เวลา พวกคุณต้องการแค่ที่จะเล่นเกมแพงๆให้คุ้มค่าให้นานที่สุด สำหรับวัยสะรุ่นแล้ว Space Marine 2 ไม่ค่อยที่จะตอบโจทย์สักเท่าไหร่ ที่คุณต้องมาซื้อเกมราคา 1,490 บาท แต่รวมเวลาอิ่มตัวมันได้แค่ 50 ชั่วโมงถึง 60 ชั่วโมง วัยสำหรับพวกคุณมีพลัง Power อยู่แล้วแบบแอบแม่เล่นเกมได้ยันตี 3 ตี 4 แล้วค่อยไปเรียนตอนเช้าแล้วแอ็คเพื่อนว่า ""กุแอบแม่เล่น SM2 ถึงตี 3 ตี 4 แล้วกุค่อยมาเรียนหว่ะเพิ้ล แม่งโครตหนุกเลย กุเจ๋งป่ะ?"".. โดยรวมแล้ว 1,490 บาทไม่คุ้มที่จะเล่นในระยะยาวครับถ้าคุณไม่ชอบจริงๆ การที่คุณต้องจ่ายเงิน 1,490 บาทในวัยสะรุ่น วัยเอ้าะๆแบบนี้แล้วต้องรอ Content อีกเป็นปีมันไม่คุ้มครับ ใครที่รอได้รอตอนลดดีกว่าครับคุ้มค่าแน่นอน เกมเขาดีย์ครับ",2024/9/9,th

Pues ya habiendo completado el modo historia, modo cooperativo y echado PvP puedo decir que el juego es crema, es la cima que tiene que alcanzar un juego de Warhammer 40k, sin despreciar a los demás que hacen muy buen trabajo peor incluso está joya no está exenta de fallos. Empecemos:


Graficos y optimización: 10/10
Si algo me gusta de Focus, es que los estudios que tiene trabajan muy bien en los juegos, es decir, éste juego con una 2080 la mueven en ultra y no baja en ningún momento de 60 fps, todo lo que enseñaron está, nada de Downgrades.

Dificultad: 3/10
No sé que le han hecho al juego en éste aspecto aparte de estar pensado para jugar con amigos, es que al jugar al modo coop e historia se les ha ido mucho la mano con enemigos que te pueden hacer instant kill, que vale que tenga que ser desafiante pero es un juego que estás rodeado de enemigos, no hay forma de hacerlo de forma táctica, pero es que si lo juegas en modo normal, también te dan tremenda ondanada de bofetones, en el coop no han llegado a matar en el nivel más bajo y eso que es el recomendado y no tiene nada que ver con el nivel de tú personaje.

Modo Historia: 7/10
Pues el modo Historia sin spoilers es un muy buen sucesor del uno dándole profundidad a los personajes y al propio mundo pero con unos quizás errores de Lore que están muy cogidos con pinzas, pero dentro de lo que cabe, muy bueno

Modo Coop 8/10
Es la otra parte de campaña del modo historia y al igual que el modo Historia puedes jugarla solo o con amigos, no tiene nada más allá

Personalización: 9/10
Aquí parece que han escuchado a la comunidad porque la mejoría es brutal, pudiendo personalidad independientemente cada parte del astartes, y con un detalle de que los colores son los colores de GW, por otro lado, lo malo, que todo está bloqueado todo y que parte son dlcs, además de que lo peor es que a los Herejes no te dejan apenas personalizarlo, algo que me parece alucinante, espero que en el futuro lo cambien.

Modo Multi: 8/10

Esto no tiene nada más allá de lo que hubo en el 1, mismos modos, en el futuro habrá modo Supervivencia (Exterminatus) y no hay nada más destacable de que los niveles que subas aquí y lo que desbloquees no es conjunto con el modo coop, y es molesto porque hay mucho, demasiado que desbloquear y no da tanto de sí el juego

Nota Final 8/10
Un digno sucesor de Space Marine 1 con lo que uno espera de la secuela, mejoras, más sangra y muerte, y con momentazos brutales, muy bien conseguido",2024/9/8,es

По вахе в целом не так много хороших игр, но Space marine 2 - это не просто пример хорошей игры по вселенной, это пример игры, где люди, за ней стоявшие – настоящие фанатики, которые шарят за мемы, за лор. Шарят как сделать так, чтобы вы не могли оторваться от экрана до самых титров. Орали от эпика, проникались персонажами, а в конце просто в экстазе смотрели титры под чертовски крутой саундтрек, и пускали скупую ультрамариновую слезу, что приключение Тита закончилось (или нет?)).

В целом это ГОТИ (но починить мультиплеер нужно как можно оперативнее).

За очень очень долгое время без нормальных сюжетных игр, похождения Тита оставят мощнейший отпечаток в вашей памяти.

Distemper,1,371.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198320092262/,"主线剧情很不错，但是剩下的多人联机内容（联机PVE, PVP）可玩度不太高，整体内容量偏少（战役只有10小时出头）。另外战斗需要练习，并不算轻松。

作为40k爱好者好评，但不是锤粉不推荐原价入手。
===============================================================
1. 最大优点：剧情战役体验相当不错。
战斗、后勤场景建模细节特别足，40k战争的临场感做的非常好。
NPC对话丰富细腻，人物形象鲜明，宛如一段沉浸式体验的电视剧。

2. 主要缺点：相比定价而言,内容量还是少了，只有10小时出头。
主线战役内容只有10小时。完成之后就剩下多人联机的PVE（支线剧情，讲主线剧情同时，其他小队在干嘛），目前只有6个任务。然后还有PVP，平衡很差基本可以忽略。

十多小时的内容对于这个价格的游戏来说，体量太小了。（作为对比，近期类似定价的黑神话悟空够60小时）


战斗机制决定了这个游戏并不是轻松愉快的爽游，而是需要不停进行快节奏的格挡/闪避-手枪爆头反击-处决的循环。

大部分近战武器的动作并不快，动作后摇长且不容易取消。因此高难度下主动攻击往往容易被怪围殴，只有少量招式实用。远程武器除了热熔之外伤害都较为平庸(狙击只适合少数精英怪，且弹药非常有限)。而格挡-处决可以快速恢复护甲并清空杂兵，收益非常高。





======================================================
Brief english vesion:

Nice campaign experience, but size of content doesn't match the price (~10h campaign + 6 PVE maps + PVP) .
Combat is not easy and requires practice to excel.

It's the monster rather than player that control the rhythm of fight, parry and counterattack is vital if you want to win the game smoothly.

As a 40k lover I'm more than satisfied with the campaign. But, if you're not a 40k fan, this game is not recommended at full price. (There would be more content in 2025, wait until then if you are interested)",2024/9/9,en
无心,1,9.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198129308801/,"赞美帝皇！是他给予我们如此优秀的游戏！
《Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2》是《Warhammer 40,000》的系列新作，《Warhammer 40,000》有着独属于自己极为宏大的哥特式太空歌剧背景故事！在这里人类文明已经发展了40000年，强大的人类文明早已实现了星际跨越，人类帝国在太空的无节制扩展使得势力版图空前庞大，众多强大无比的星际战士以忠于帝皇为信仰，他们始终团结在帝皇周围，立誓为帝皇而战！消灭一切敌对！这也塑就了《Warhammer 40,000》里众多可歌可泣的传奇故事！

欢迎关注 网易UU鉴赏家培养计划
关注网易UU鉴赏家，开启精彩游戏之旅。

荣耀即为我的生命！
游戏的画面风格是一如既往的40K味道，各处场景都充满了黑暗复古的哥特风格，其中又带着一些古典魔幻的高科技，这种看似矛盾又极端契合的画面感结合战锤40K那完整到庞大无比的世界观，那写实主义与未来主义的碰撞融合，而且是极致融洽的融合，也许这也是战锤40K一直屹立不倒并且衍生作不断的关键之一吧！整个游戏过程每换一个场景总能给我们一堆新的视觉震撼，在视觉效果设置调到最高的前提下，说是步步是美景都一点不为过！

游戏全程都有着中文配音，就连配角和路边的路人甲乙丙丁都会时不时蹦出几句，让游戏沉浸感十足！特别是战斗过程中，战士们面对近乎无法战胜的虫潮从四面八方用来，大伙依然一边高喊“为了帝皇！”一边无所畏惧的战斗冲锋，那悍不畏死的场景，那无可畏惧的战场氛围，简直绝了！

游戏起始于外星异形泰伦虫族入侵帝国掌控下的星球，星际战士杀戮小队领命驰援，谁知道敌不寡众加上降落时遇异形袭击，整个小队仅剩我们操纵下的队长泰图斯没有死于非命，于是拯救星球的使命自然只能由我们一力承当！能陪伴我们的只有开局一把链锯剑和路上捡到的爆矢枪！在这个新手教程都能让新手死亡N次的任务里，经过一番苦苦挣扎，最后我们终于在成功发射毒气弹到平流层后，被杀之不尽的异形及其BOSS围杀，在即将殒命之时，救援终于赶到！再次醒来之时，我们操纵的主角已经被改造成为一名伟大且强大的原铸星际战士！更为凶险的传说战斗，就此翻开了帷幕！一切都是“为了帝皇！”

作为帝国最强大的原铸星际战士，帝国在武器库里给我们配备了十数款性能威力各异的爆矢枪、三款可以与近战武器搭配使用的帝国制式手枪和四款威力绝伦的近战武器，以确保我们每次出征都能旗开得胜！不同的款式都有着自己的攻击机制和攻击效果，需要我们在战前给自己好好挑选配备！

游戏的战斗过程简直让人热血沸腾，面对那悍不畏死的异形虫潮，数之不尽的一群一群的汹涌冲杀而来，无论是使用手中爆矢枪进行各种远程弹火喷射覆盖、又或者直接手持链锯剑高喊一声“为了帝皇！”，然后冲入虫潮来一波浴血收割！配合着身边一起战斗的小队队友，那感觉是真的会让人忘记恐惧激动不已的！也许这就是传说中的信仰之力和战友之情？

当然，激动归激动，这实力要是跟不上的话，多次任务失败也是会让人沮丧不已的！虽说我们已经成为帝国最精锐的原铸星际战士，并且手持帝国最为强大的各式武器，而且也有传说：“只要是碳基生物就抵不过重火力！”站台，太奈何真的耐不住异形虫潮是真的太多太密集了哇！在激情彭拜的战斗过程中市场会有一个手雷扔进去炸飞一堆的场景、也有着手持链锯剑一套蓄力横扫打飞一堆的战况，但各位小伙伴记忆更深刻的是，虫潮汹涌过来把我们伟岸的身躯湮没的场景吧！？但这丝毫不影响我们在不停的战斗过程中享受那一套干掉一群的爽快和刺激，荷尔蒙剧增的感觉简直不要太爽！

但激情总有冷却的时候，《Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2》的单人剧情模式实在太短了，基本上十个小时就能通关，而且游戏就是线性剧情，并不存在什么支线一类的设置，就算地图有那么几个没探索过的小角落，里面也不存在什么惊喜和宝藏，有几个留声芯片就已经是最大收获了。因此在通关了剧情之后，也没有什么多周目的必要。

好在《Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2》还是支持线上多人模式的，在此模式下选好职业后会有一些武器使用限制，不停的战斗刷怪来获取掉落更高级的装备也就变现成了最大乐趣！通过战斗提升的枪械熟练度也让游戏有了那么一些养成元素，提升对应的枪械熟练度也就成了与小伙伴们合作战斗爆更好的神装之外的最大追求！当然，线上联机主要还是要注意网络稳定，特别是当队长的，一旦掉线可是会拖着所有队员一起退出游戏的！这里就得推荐一下UU加速器了！使用UU加速器加速网络来进行游戏，足以让你整个游戏过程网络稳如老狗！——小伙伴们再也不用担心网络掉线！

另外，游戏刚开始的时候似乎需要开启epic验证（本人没遇到，但许多小伙伴遇到了），这里给遇到epic验证的小伙伴提供下解决方法：
1.卡epic服务更新:关闭游戏和steam;打开加速器的epic加速;在windows的任务管理器里面搜索epic进程并全部关掉;再打开steam检查游戏完整性;点启动游戏，重新更新epic online service进游戏。
2.epic服务更新完成仍然打不开游戏:进入游戏的安装目录，直接启动“Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2”进游戏。

最后，游戏操作对应键盘键位的设计人员一定是个“天才”，竟然把格挡设计到C键上！这到底是什么鬼畜设计！！！这里还是推荐使用手柄，对游戏操作有更好的适配性！也能让战斗更为舒适！

最后的最后，我们需要赞美帝皇！是他给予我们这么爽快的游戏体验！让我们一起为了帝皇而战！为了忠诚而战！",2024/9/10,zh-cn

GLB,1,71.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GRZOGRZ/,"Ну вот и вышло долгожданное продолжение. Ждал с момента выхода первого трейлера и внимательно следил за ней до выхода, даже не выдержал и купил голд издание, чтобы пораньше залететь. Так вот, если коротко, то игрулька вышла что надо, прям реально с первых минут лютое месилово и замесик идёт, не говоря уже про ебейший конец, где прям реально заруба на все бабки.

Из плюсов мне прям жутко зашел новый визуал, звуки и работа над деталями. Над этим в игре прям очень хорошо поработали, да так, что я как настоящий вахоеб получал лютые оргазмы в некоторые моменты, по сравнению с первой частью игра ощущается как полноценный проект по 40к. Всякие гвардейцы с их репликами, механикусы и сервиторы, другие космодесы и просто окружение реально круто сделано, веришь что ты участвуешь в войне галактического масштаба, а не в местной заварушке. Куча отсылок на предыдущую часть, а также на события в мире вахи, добавляют антуража.

Геймплей в игре, как по мне на уровне выше среднего, до отличного явно не дотягивает ибо есть косяки и недоработки, однако я думаю что их можно будет поправить после полноценного выхода игры 9 числа. В частности меня расстроила новая система добиваний, которая выглядит (как и всё в игре) сочно, смачно и мега круто, но функциональности в них немного, ибо теперь вместо восстановления ХП после добивания, у нас восстанавливается только значение заряда силового поля. Играл я на максимальной сложности, из за чего, не считая всяких ништячков, которые разбросаны по карте и добавляют немного заряда к броне, у меня было лишь две ячейки, которые даже самые слабенькие противники в игре сносят за пару секунд ближнего боя, не говоря уже про более сложных и сильных врагов. При этом всём, добивания теперь работают только на ""сильных"" противников, а всякая мелюзга просто помирает, из-за этого восстановить даже броню во время боя вызывает трудности, всяких ""синих"" парирований и убийств после оглушительного комбо явно не хватает, так как после одного-двух добиваний тебе сносят всю броню секунд за 5-10 и ты снова с голой жопой вынужден убегать и отстреливаться от врагов. Ближе к концу, когда появляется опыт и нормальное вооружение эта проблема не так заметна, но всё таки она есть. Помимо этого оружия не так уж и много, по сути 50% всего вооружения в игре это модификации штурмового болтера с +- одними и теми же хар-ками, ну и плазмомёт имба кста. Союзники стали реально убивать и че то делать с врагами, это по сравнению с прошлой частью реально плюс, еще теперь враги вас не убивают сразу, а нокают, из этого состояния вас могут поднять всё те же союзники-боты, ну или игроки, если вы играете кооп, и это я считаю реально круто, особенно на максимальной сложности. Враги разнообразные и каждый имеет свою роль, что для такой игры очень важно и заставляет продумывать свою тактику боя в зависимости от арены и вооружения, плюс имеются всякие ""минибоссы"" - мобики с большим количеством хп и особыми атаками, которые реально могут намылить вам жопу. Стрельба ощущается прикольно, в частности из-за звука, да и вообще всё что связано со звуком в этой игре сделано реально круто.

Сюжет же, несмотря на наличием в нём аж трёх разных планет на самом деле довольно короткий, если бы не пве операции и максимальная сложность, я думаю у меня ушло бы часов 8-9 на полное прохождение этой игры. Но по наполнению героями, действующими лицами и сюжетными поворотами игра реально на голову выше первой части, не говоря уже о том, что мы теперь не просто отряд бедолаг, закинутый на пустую планету с орками, а реально целая рота космодесанта, которая взаимодействует между собой и с другими военный организациями, в частности с имперской гвардией (Лейтенанта Миры в этой игре нет=( )

Насчет мультиплеера могу сказать, что проходить сюжетку советую в коопе с друзьяшками на максимальной сложности, ибо тогда будет намного интереснее и намного легче, чем в соло с ботами. ПВЕ операции меня приятно удивили и играются реально бодро и круто, даже с рандомами, плюс кастомизация своего космодеса добавила шарма. В игре можно сделать почти всё что угодно в плане кастомизации, налепить эмблему альфа-легиона на лояльного космодеса и пойти воевать против тиранидов в отряде с кровавым вороном и саламандрой? Да запросто! Покрасить свой доспех так, что издалека вы будете похожи на огромного арлекина? Легче легкого, короче простор для фантазии в этой игре есть и это тоже очень круто, не говоря уже о том, что кастомить можно в том числе ХСМ. Ну а ПВП режим я заценить пока не смог.

Как итог игрушка реально классная, по моему личному мнению она занимает явно топ всех игр по вахе из современности. Тут есть почти всё что надо любому вахоебу: Кровь, кишки, распидорасило, куча всяких терминов из вахи, которые обыватели никогда не слышали, эпичность и превозмогание, болтер-порно (в хорошем смысле) ну и конечно же любимый всеми Лейтенант ТИТЯ, ведь это игра про НАШЕГО РУССКОГО ДМИТРИЯ ТИТОВА. А ну и да игру наши слоники делали, которые завезли НАИКРУТЕЙШУЮ русскую озвучку, так что это тоже жирнющий плюс в копилку игры. РЕКОМЕНДУЮ!!!!

G?$T|HUN|,1,14.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghosthun1999/,"Jogosan nagy hype volt a Space Marine 2 érkezésére, emiatt egyeseknek csalódás lehet.

Tipikusan egy egyszeri végigjátszásra elég kategóriáról beszélünk, ami egyébként jól sikerült, de semmi extra. A story röviden hogy keresztes hadjáratot alapítottak meg azzal a céllal hogy visszaszerezzék az elveszett világokat az ellenségeiktől.

Lényegében megyünk előre és daráljuk az ellenfeleket egy zárt pályán. Igazság szerint fa ék egyszerű a mechanika és emellett 6-8 óra alatt kijátszható. Ami piros pont hogy az egész kampányt 3 fős coop játékmódban is kilehet vinni. Illetve a story haladtával nyílnak meg úgynevezett operation küldetések, amik a fő story mellet történnek egy időben, amiből összesen 6 küldetés van. Lehet fejlődni, van skill ágazat, de a multirésze nem vonzott.

Grafika rendben van, környezeti elemek, részletek, az egész világ látványosra sikeredett. Hangzásokról pedig annyit tudnék írni hogy átlagos. Az optimalizációra fogjuk rá hogy jól sikerült. Ultra beállítások 1440p, rtx 3080, i7 9700k mellet 70-80 fps van átlagban.

Mint negatívumként eléggé cpu erős játék. A mai igényesebb játékok max grafikával a cpu max 50-55C körül mozog, viszont itt a 60-67C simán eléri. A hdr kihagyásáért kár, az epic kényszer telepítése pedig tragikus. Az ára pedig pénztárca függő hogy kinek ér meg ennyit egy 6-8 órás viszonylag lineáris kampány.

Grafika: 4/5
Játékélmény: 3/5
Hangzások: 3/5",2024/9/10,hu
ArcticKingX,1,59.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArcticKingX/,"Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 – There is only war

Nachdem ich nun sämtliche Missionen des Spiels abgeschlossen habe und mich im PVP verprügeln lassen habe (ich habe aber auch gut ausgeteilt), werd ich erneut meine Eindrücke mit euch teilen.

Die Story

Planet Kadaku – ein verschlüsselter Notruf wird über einen Cogitator gesendet, Bedrohung – Tyranniden, Strategischer Wert auf Kadaku...Absolut. Die Nachricht wird ausgesendet und nahe Kräfte antworten. Ein Team von Astartes wird ausgesandt um sich der Bedrohung zu stellen...



Space Marine 2 ist ein Third-Person-Shooter, wo Ihr entweder allein oder in einem Team von 3, durch die Horden von Tyranniden durchschießt oder schlachtet. Als nun Leutnant Titus der Ultramarines wird die Geschichte um Ihn und Ihm herum weiter erzählt und setzt neben durchschlagskäftigen Boltern auch verschiedene Nahkampfwaffen wie Kampfmesser. Ähnlich wie im ersten Teil werdet Ihr von Horden der Tyranniden angegriffen, welche aber nicht nur als Horma/Termaganten auftreten (welche den Großteil des Schwarms ausmachen), sondern auch Tyranniden Krieger und oder andere gefährlichere Aliens auf Euch losgehen.

Der Nahkampf von Space Marine 2 wurde hier überarbeitet und es kommt sehr häufig zu Duellen zwischen euch und den größeren Tyranniden. Neben schnellen Schlägen, könnt Ihr starke Schläge austeilen, die euren Gegner betäuben können und euch so etwas mehr Luft zum atmen verschaffen. Sollte dies keine Option sein könnt Ihr auch rennen und Ausweichrollen einsetzen, um so Distanz aufzubauen oder euch aus einer umzingelten Situation befreien. Wer aber den Zweikampf sucht, so bietet euch das Spiel nun die Möglichkeit Attacken zu parieren und zu kontern, sodass Ihr euren Kontrahenten ebenfalls ins Schwitzen bringen könnt um Ihn am Ende seiner Lebensspanne genüsslich aus dem Leben zu treten.

Gespielt habe ich mit 2 Freunden auf dem höchsten Schwierigkeitsgrad und ich muss sagen, dass es deutlich schwerer war als der erste Teil. Kämpfe sind intensiver und man hat weniger Möglichkeiten sich zu heilen. Gerade der Nahkampf ist recht gewöhnungsbedürftig, da man recht schnell zerfetzt werden kann und das kontern echt gelernt sein muss.

Nach der Story bietet euch das Spiel eine Parallelstory, die ebenfalls in der Story sich abspielt aber nicht durch Titus`s Squad durchgeführt werden. In diesem PvE-Modus stehen euch nun 6 Klassen, wie der “einfache“ Tactical, Scharfschütze oder dem Bulwark zur Verfügung, die Ihr nach Euren Vorstellungen anpassen könnt und auch im Level aufsteigen. Im fortgeschrittenem Level habt Ihr die Möglichkeit Perks freizuschalten, welche dann mit Währung freigekauft werden müssen. So bieten sich verschiedenste Symbiosen unter den Klassen an, um so auch ein Alleinstellungsmerkmal für die Klassen zu generieren, nicht nur durch Ihre Bewaffnung.

Auch eure Waffen können etwas aufgewertet werden, welche Klassenübergreifend (Falls diese Klasse Zugriff hat) sind. Wie Ihr euch auch entscheidet, haben Sie entweder mehr Durchschlagskraft, mehr Munition oder sind einfach präziser.

Der PVP-Modus bietet derzeit 3 Spielmodi – Deathmatch, Capture the Flag und King of the Hill, alle teambasiert. Auch hier habt Ihr die 6 Klassen zur Verfügung und eure Astartes können optisch etwas angepasst werden, wobei die Chaos Astartes sehr stiefmütterlich behandelt werden derzeit. Die Modi liefen alle soweit sehr rund, nur finde ich das der Nahkampf etwas lasch erscheint, ich habe sehr häufig das Gefühl, dass ich keinen Schaden mache. Das kommt daher das der Gegner entweder schwer ins Wanken gebracht oder an dem schlechten Trefferfeedback. An sich kommt es dem Space Marine 1 PVP schon gut nahe und wir werden abwarten was noch so kommt.

Es ist Crossplay vorhanden, Ihr werdet auch mit euren Leuten Spielen können die das Spiel auf der Xbox oder Playstation spielen.

Ich bin auf einige kleine Bugs gestoßen, wie einige Grafik/Soundbugs. Hin und wieder konnte ich keine Eingaben machen, da musste ich des öfteren aus dem Spiel raus und rein Tabben. Ansonsten liefen die Server recht solide, hin und wieder kam es zu kleineren Störungen.



Gespielt wird mit Maus und Tastatur oder wahlweise Controller. Die Standardeinstellung der Tastatur war etwas fragwürdig, ist aber kein Problem da diese geändert werden kann. Es ließ sich sehr flüssig sowohl mit Maus+Tastatur spielen als auch mit dem Controller. Ich empfehle aber dennoch die regulären Eingabegeräte da man einfach präziser ist und ich denke auch schneller reagieren kann, ist aber Geschmackssache. Das Kontern muss hier definitiv gelernt werden, da das Zeitfenster echt knapp ist und das Timing stimmen muss.



Ein absoluter Ohr-gassmus, Überall wird geschossen, es explodiert was, Bolterfeuer, Kettenschwerter, stampfende Marines, der Ansturm von Tyranniden und dazu diese epische Orchester im Hintergrund. Es trifft Grim-dark genau ins schwarze und man hat nicht das Gefühl man schießt mit Erbsenkanonen….Außer das Astra Militarum natürlich...



Space Marine 2 hat einen sehr großen Sprung vom ersten Teil gemacht, sehr schön detailierte Grafiken, Tyranniden sehen super aus und vorallem unsere Astartes. Blut und Schlamm setzt sich an der Rüstung ab, im Hintergrund kommt eine Horde Tyranniden an und man stellt fest „Ohh ****, dass sind echte Gegner!“ die da auf einen zukommen und versuchen die Wände hochzuklettern und kein schön animierter Hintergrund um uns den Krieg so nah wie möglich zu bringen, man ist mitten drin.



Rosarote Brille ab, alles im allem Macht Space Marine 2 sehr viel richtig, ist aber sehr kurz. Nach ungefähr 18 Stunden haben wir bereits alle Missionen abgeschlossen und haben dann nur noch dieselben Missionen fürs aufleveln gespielt. Es gibt noch recht wenig Content fürs Geld wie ich finde und sage daher, dass man auf einen Rabatt warten sollte. Je länger Ihr wartet um so flüssiger läuft auch das Spiel im nachhinein, es muss noch etwas feintuning erleben. Eine Roadmap für kommenden Content ist vorhanden weshalb diese Review hier nur grundlegendes erläutern soll. Alles im allem empfehle ich uneingeschränkt weiter.",2024/9/8,de
[★] NapoSky_* ☺,1,110.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/napoleon59w/,"Ce jeu est un banger tout azimuth.
D'avance : Oubliez les avis des streamers, oubliez les avis des casus qui s'attendent à avoir tout a portée de main sans rien faire. C'est ni le jeu pour, ni l'univers pour.
Si vous avez fait le premier Warhammer: Space Marine, un seul mot d'ordre : Foncez. Pour l'Empereur.

Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 est définitivement le digne successeur du précédent opus.
- Vous trouviez des lacunes graphiques au premier ? Balayé.
- Vous aviez l'impression d'être toujours tout seul dans un univers immense ? Oubliez.
- Vous avez fait le tour du premier en vous disant que c'était plutôt arcade avec une difficulté un peu claqué ? Oubliez également, Ici, on tryhard. Les tyrannides sont réellement nombreux, et les agents du chaos tapent lourd
- Vous êtes fan des vidéos fanmades Astartes ? Ici on monte encore d'un cran.

Un peu à l'image de DOOM Eternal, vous pourriez vous arrêter devant divers plans de combats au loin tellement le décor est dynamique. Aux premiers abords vous pouvez vous dire ""Haha, sur un millier de tyrannides j'en aurai que 10"". Non, pas de tromperies, vous allez réellement vous manger des hordes en temps et en heure.

A contrario des casus qui disent que la campagne est terminable en 6h (en jouant en easy et en rushant, évidemment). Comptez 10h pour tenter de la boucler en vétéran, et un peu plus de 20h en ange de la mort (soit ""Pas moins que le premier opus""). La difficulté est là, et la coopération est de mise. Vous êtes en perpétuel mouvement dans une invasion d'un vaisseau ruche qui est là pour vous éradiquer.

Les opérations viennent compléter le scénario puisque ce sont des missions d'escouades annexes aux missions de Titus, vous permettant de découvrir de nouveaux objectifs, et pour votre plus grand plaisir : de nouveaux boss.

Vous vous souvenez du lore du 1 ? Soyez prêts pour le scénario déployé par le 2.


Tout ça pour dire :
+ Définitivement un banger pour un studio AA
+ Le lore, le scénario, les cinématiques, les graphismes sont monstrueux
/ On pourrait couiner sur la linéarité, mais très clairement vu la qualité déployé avec 13 ans d'attente, c'est réellement un détail.
- La courbe d'apprentissage des combos et techniques n'est pas linéaire. Il va falloir cracher du sang au départ pour monter dans les difficultés.

En cuanto multijugador, es bueno pero necesita pulirse bastante cuanto zonas de respawns, zonas cerradas, vida general y equilibrar mas las clases, creo que podría quedar un multijugador bastante decente si retocan estos aspectos.

9.5 из 10 (Отлично)
Сюжет
Разворачивается в 42-м тысячелетии, в эпоху Тёмной Империи. После возвращения примарха Робаута Жиллимана человечество начинает новую кампанию по возвращению потерянных систем, известную как «Неодолимый крестовый поход». В это время на западных рубежах галактики обнаруживается новый флот-улей тиранидов, прозванный «Левиафаном». Человечество готовится дать отпор флоту вторжения в Четвёртой тиранической войне.
Орден Ультрамаринов, протагонист первой части игры, отправляется в системы Аваракс и Кадаку для отражения атаки тиранидов. В рядах ордена сражается отряд лейтенанта Тита, состоящий из брата-сержанта Гадриеля и брата Харона.
Представляет собой смесь жанров экшена и шутера от третьего лица. Игроку предстоит взять на себя роль космического десантника ордена Ультрамаринов, сражающегося против тиранидов — враждебной расы, стремящейся уничтожить человечество.
В игре доступны различные виды оружия, такие как цепной меч, боевой нож, ручной пистолет-болтер и тяжёлые болтеры. Также можно использовать мельта-ружьё, плавящее всё на своём пути потоком плазмы.
Боевая система основана на использовании различных приёмов и способностей космического десантника, таких как блокирование ударов, парирование и уворот. Игрок должен умело комбинировать эти элементы, чтобы эффективно сражаться с врагами.
Игровой процесс включает в себя выполнение различных миссий и сражений с различными типами тиранидов, такими как рядовые хормагаунты и крупные тираниды-воины. Игроку предстоит перемещаться по разнообразным локациям, таким как космические корабли, планеты и орбитальные станции.
Графика в игре Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 впечатляет своим уровнем детализации и проработкой окружения. Игра предлагает невероятно детализированные текстуры и модели персонажей, создавая ощущение погружения в мрачную атмосферу вселенной Warhammer 40,000. Полчища врагов и окружение оставляют многих игроков в благоговении перед масштабами и качеством графики.
1) Сюжет: продолжение истории главного героя, знаменитого космодесантника Тита из первой части Space Marine 2011 года.
2) Режимы игры: доступны PvE- и PvP-режимы, называемые «Операции» и «Вечная война» соответственно.
3) Кампания: кроме сюжетной кампании, игроки могут выполнять миссии в кооперативном режиме для трёх человек.
4) Прокачка персонажа: игроки могут улучшать своего героя, повышая его характеристики, навыки и открывая новые способности.
5) Кастомизация: игроки могут настраивать внешний вид своего героя, выбирая из множества доступных вариантов брони, шлемов и других элементов экипировки.
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 — это превосходный шутер, который порадует поклонников вселенной Warhammer и любителей напряжённых сражений. Игра предлагает захватывающий геймплей, впечатляющие битвы и атмосферу грандиозности. Графика и производительность находятся на высоком уровне, а мультиплеерный режим добавляет разнообразия. Фанатам серии и новичкам игра придётся по вкусу.
P.S. 1 — У игры большой потенциал для расширения контента с помощью cсюжетных DLC. Будем надеется, что разработчик реализует данные возможности.
P.S. 2 — Во время игры единственным техническим сбоем была застывшая заставка вступительного ролика в начале новой игры, однако после установки последнего драйвера NVIDIA проблема была решена, в остальном никаких технических проблем о которых писали другие рецензенты я не наблюдал.
P.S. 3 — Очень порадовало наличие полной русской озвучки.",2024/9/8,ru

SM2 at its best is another great addition to the highly loved horde shooter genre with a WH40K coat of paint on it, with my high love for WH40K it was a great journey to go through this game and be genuinely in awe over environment work and how being a space marine should truly feel.

For some this may not reach the expectations that they had been hoping for after such a long wait, for me i was satisfied with story and length. The COOP experience allowed for a lot more of a immersive time.

This is a genre of game that can always live on and with time if supported with their already shown roadmap, this will easily live up to being one of the best WH40K games next to the Dawn of War series.

Of course with a game like this it is expected that people will get tired of doing the same thing over and over with the minimal amount of content based inside PvE and PVP on launch, for what it is im already 30-40 hours in and still finding fun in spending time making myself look amazing with customization and PVP every now and then.

За двадцать с небольшим часов, впечатления от игры исключительно положительные. Выглядит всё дорого-богато, полюбоваться есть чем. Стилистика вселенной воссоздана отлично, архитектуру и прочее окружение на локациях приятно рассматривать между мясорубками с противниками. Задние планы открытых уровней почти всегда динамичные, что добавляет масштабности происходящего, живости мира и ощущения планетарных боевых действий. Боевая система довольно не плохая, совмещающая в себе дальний и ближний бой. В наличии уворот, отскок, блок и парирование. Можно делать мясные красочные добивания, анимаций которых более 50 штук. Они зависят от вашего оружия, противника и его положения по отношению к вам. Противники порой напирают целыми кишащими ордами, как крысы в играх A Plague Tale, что выглядит эпично.
Совместно можно проходить как основной сюжет игры, так и отдельные боевые операции, которых на данный момент 6 штук. Они вплетены в основной сюжет, показывая некоторые события развивающиеся параллельно. На выбор четыре сложности и шесть классов бойцов с разными способностями, вооружением и живучестью. Кооператив кроссплатформенный и работает нормально.
Мультиплеер напоминает Gears of War, разве что за укрытие присесть нельзя. Пока всего несколько карт и три режима, два из которых это ""дезматч"" и ""захват и удержание"". Команды 6на6 с теми же 6ю классами бойцов. В команде может быть не более двух бойцов одного класса. Мультиплеер работает нормально, хотя бывают моменты, когда при подключении с сервера выкидывает, причем целиком всё лобби и поиск начинается заново, надеюсь починят. При том, что многие жалуются на техническое состояние игры, у меня сама игра вылетела за 20 часов всего раз и как ни странно просто при первом запуске, так что не считается.
Думаю разработчики могут гордиться своим творением, и игра станет достойной частью вселенной, где война идёт вечно. У них даже есть какие никакие планы на поддержку игры в будущем, что любопытно. Лично я требую добавления седьмого класса ""Апотекарий"" с возможностью подхиливать союзников и вырезать прогеноиды у павших товарищей.",2024/9/6,ru

타이투스 팀이 우회로 할때 하이브타이런트를 잡으러 갔던 발리우스의 팀이 되는거죠
좋게는 캠페인을 개선된 AI와 또 하는 느낌이라 좋았습니다
단점은, 전장이 넓어서 협동보다는 개개인이 각자 바쁜 상황이 몇몇 연출되었다는 건데
이건 공방의 문제이니 그러려니 합니다.

결론적으로
이 게임 알고 먹어야 맛있는게임인데, 알기가 참 어렵습니다 워해머가
마블 시네마틱 공부는 애들 장난이죠
그럼에도 차세대 엔진으로 그려지는 전장에서 몰려오는 호드들을 베어넘기는 재미는 단기간에 좋습니다

FroheMilchmann,1,13.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037650969/,"UPD: So, I finished the campaign after almost 9h. Honestly, I feel like raising my score to a solid 9/10, it somehow kept getting better and more epic every hour. I haven't even touched the operations and PVP yet, but I'm ready for more gameplay, it was awesome. Could you find some nitpicks? Sure, I heard some people saying that it's too coop oriented, finishers don't give you health the same way as in the first game, etc, but I personally loved it. One of the best 40K games out there at this point.

EARLY REVIEW

I’ve gotta say - before I played it myself, I had a healthy dose of doubts and was just cautiously optimistic about this game, but man - it’s a blast so far! Considering the amount of epicness happening at all times, it is surprisingly well optimized and runs at very stable 60 with all high settings. The main thing that might bottleneck for some people is CPU, so you might wanna check that (thankfully I have no problems with it).

Gameplay-wise, it’s quite fun, more engaging and deeper than the first game, but it is more coop/online oriented (however, I have no issues playing it solo currently).

Story-wise - pretty much what you might expect from an action game based in the 40k. Nothing groundbreaking, but the tone is great, and characters are enjoyable.

Graphics, art, sound design - really impressed, you can feel the scale of big war, but at the same time there are little details everywhere that fans will surely appreciate. Guns and music are more meaty this time around, which I love.

Long story short - if you like solid, gripping action, and of course, the 40k universe, then it’s a must! GO SLAY SOME TYRANIDS FOR THE EMPEROR, BROTHER

장점
나 같은 광신도 워해머 빠돌이는 미쳐 죽어버릴 정도로 갓벽하게 잘 구현됨. 그냥 신 그자체임.
워해머 세계관 설정 분위기.. 스마의 힘과 성격 능력을 가장 잘 표현한 미쳐버린 게임.
캠페인 중간 중간 npc들 대화 내용이나 주위 환경부터 진행 할수록 몰입감 지리고 마치 내가 진짜 하나의 스마가 된 기분 느께게 해줌.
수 많은 적 무리의 물결 표현이 미쳤음. 적들이 다가올때 나즈막히 '와라.' 이 한마디가 육성으로 터질 정도로 전율적이다.
전투 처형 액션 지림 헤드셋 소리 크게 키우고 하는데 진짜 전쟁 한복판 총과 체인소드와 썬더해머의 폭발음 살이 터지고 찢기는 소리가 그냥 지림.
짧은 캠페인으로 염병 떨기엔 수명을 갈아 넣은 연출과 상남자라면 랄부를 부여잡게 만드는 미친 스토리에 지려버릴것이다. 병아리가 이 게임을 한다면 황제의 상징 쌍두 독수리로 성장할 테스토스테론 그 자체다.
슬라네쉬 같은 개ㅈ같은 추남 추녀 여장 남장 게이 비만돼지 트젠은 전혀 없고 오로지 전쟁터에 승리를 갈구하는 인류제국의 처절함과 게걸스러운 외계생물 그리고 역겨운 이단자들 뿐이다.
캠페인 끝나고도 할게 좀 많음. 그런데 심한 노가다도 아니다. 본인이 진정한 한 명의 아뎁투스 아르타르테스라는 가정하에 위험도 높은 미션을 돌면 금방 직업 무기 레벨 만렙 찍을 것이다.
최근 나온 게임 중 최적화 베스트인거 같음 프레임 드랍 렉 크래쉬 안나는거 얼마만이냐?

더럽게 더운 날 마시는 차가운 맥주 같은 게임이라 볼 수 있다.

단점
걍 10마이웨이 일직선형 게임 .
날 욕심쟁이로 만들어버림.. 더 많은 걸 원하게 함. 맵 더 줘 적 더 줘 난이도 더 올려줘
장점에 적은 좋은 점 제외 특출나는 건 없음.

총평
워해머 40k 중 가장 잘 만든 게임. 언클린 원의 배변 같은 게임이 많았는데 왠일로 엄청난 걸작이 탄생했다.

-----마침내 황제께서 황금 옥좌에서 일어나 기적을 행했다고 밖에 볼 수 없다.------
이 말 한마디면 충분하겠지 형제들이여

젠취의 광신도 같이 분탕 치는 사람들이 말하길 스토리가 짧다 타격감이 구리다고 하는데 스토리가 메인이 아니며 스토리가 긴 게임은 오픈월드 게임을 하면 되고 타격감은 직접 해보면 완전 다른 느낌이다.
박진감 넘치는 전투와 타격감 살육의 쾌감이 이것보다 뛰어난 게임이 있을지 모르겠다.

분탕충 말은 안 들어도 된다. 그들은 완벽이란 없단 걸 알면서도 게임에서 완벽함을 찾는 불만 많은 안타까운 자들이다.
자기가 직접 듣고 보고 해보고 판단하라.

키 설정이 이상하다고 징징대고 컴이 구려 못하고 재능이 없어 어렵고 그저 재미를 못 느끼는 인류 조차도 사랑하시는 황제께선 환불을 허락하시었다.

Balgrim,1,53.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987710793/,"**Transcription vox d’un Space Marine après avoir expérimenté Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2**

Frères, écoutez mes paroles, car je viens de traverser une expérience qui pourrait presque égaler la gloire du champ de bataille réel. J'ai joué à un divertissement de l'Imperium, nommé **Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2**, et je dois dire qu'il est digne des plus grands héros de l’Adeptus Astartes.

Dès l’instant où j’ai pris en main le contrôle du Space Marine dans ce simulacre, j’ai senti une puissance familière, celle de notre armure énergétique, fidèle et lourde, chaque pas résonnant avec une intensité écrasante. Les développeurs de ce jeu ont capturé avec précision l'honneur et la terreur qui accompagnent le port d'une armure Mark VII. Le combat… ah, le combat, frères ! Chaque coup d’épée tronçonneuse vibre d’une vérité brutale, chaque tir de bolter frappe avec la force de l’Empereur Lui-même. Ils ont compris ce que cela signifie de mener une guerre sainte contre les xenos et les hérétiques.

Les ennemis que j'ai affrontés, ces détestables Tyranides, étaient nombreux et féroces. Leur carnage sans fin m’a rappelé les guerres sur Macragge. Le jeu capture parfaitement la frénésie de leurs assauts, te forçant à tenir ta ligne, à utiliser chaque bolt et chaque coup avec précision. Tu ressens l’urgence, l’obligation sacrée de protéger l'Imperium à tout prix. À aucun moment je ne me suis senti vulnérable, car comme dans la réalité, je savais que le devoir nous transcende. Mais la tension, frères… la tension était palpable, chaque bataille une épreuve de foi et d'acier.

Le visuel de ce jeu est une véritable ode à l’Imperium. Des citadelles imposantes, bordées de statues d'anges et de reliques sacrées, jusqu'aux vastes champs de bataille où le sang et la boue se mélangent… tout respire le 41e millénaire. Chaque détail semble béni par les Technoprêtres de Mars, une fidélité telle que l’on croirait marcher sur les propres mondes de l'Empereur.

Et la musique ! Frères, elle résonne comme les cantiques des chapelains avant la bataille. Elle t’emmène au-delà des limites de la chair, te poussant à te battre encore plus ardemment pour l’Humanité. Chaque note semble renforcée par la foi en notre saint Empereur-Dieu.

Je vous le dis sans hésitation : ce jeu est une bénédiction, une manière honorable pour ceux qui ne peuvent encore rejoindre nos rangs de comprendre ce que cela signifie d'être un Astartes. Que vous soyez aspirants, servants de l'Imperium, ou même simples citoyens, **Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2** vous donnera un aperçu de notre existence, de notre devoir sacré.

Frères, si vous avez du temps à consacrer en dehors du combat réel, alors jouez à ce jeu. Car il vous rappellera la gloire de notre mission, le poids de notre armure, et la grandeur de servir l'Empereur.

IronClad,0,17.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimIronClad/,"i dont think ive ever given a review to a game before but this game ends it today. im really torn on it because i can see all the hard work they have put into this game but it feels so empty. maybe my problem is that im playing solo, but this game is so boring. the game is beautiful and the storyline itself is great. the controls feel almost too simplistic, why couldnt we get a take cover button? the AI is so bad at helping during the campaign its like why even have them at all? they when they are on the jetpack missions they just fly and fall off the map or are never close to you unless you stand still for a minute. the jetpack controls are the worst thing ive ever used. the campaign levels are so empty, go here kill this group of mobs, then hold interact, and repeat over and over. i felt like i spent more time holding the interact button then i did playing the story. why can you just pick up ammo boxes with interact button but with grenades you have to hold down the button to collect them? all the medkits that are just trophy collections because they are clipped into the ground and cant be interacted with. the only collectibles ive found were datapads, and the invisible walls made it very empty and bland. i havent even tried PVE or PVP mode yet, but all of my complaints are purely campaign at this point. im sure the game is meant to be played with a party of 3, but im having a hard time wanting to finish this campaign because it just is so painful to play solo.",2024/9/10,en
tragic,1,565,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cureton/,"At the time of my review, I've done everything there is to do in PVE. I've gotten every class to 25, unlocked every perk, leveled every weapon to relic tier, unlocked every mastery point for each weapon, unlocked every heraldry, unlocked every cosmetic (through operations - 35 successful missions per class), and beat every operation on ruthless. Also beat the campaign, which I enjoyed.

The moment to moment gameplay is fun and rewarding as there is a skill element to maximizing your offense. Parry and Perfect dodge are great additions. All of the combat mechanics combined make grinding for unlocks in operations more of a fun journey than a chore, at least for me.

For those wondering about campaign length. It's approximately 7 hours give or take, and if you are on harder difficulties, you may find that to be longer. When you combine that with the Operations that tie into the story, that buffs it up to the 10-12 hour range.

Doing all the operations on ruthless difficulty (current max) and soloing them all was a really fun challenge, but it's not required.

EDIT: I've now played a ton of PVP (still ranking up) and I'm having a blast. At max Veterancy Level (25), I've played 100s of matches. The PVP is quite good, but it suffers from map variety. The balance is actually quite good, and there are plenty of strategies and counter strategies appearing as players get more experienced.

Overall, great game, I didn't run into any major issues, all of the classes are fun (and will be funner when a few small bugs are fixed). Emailed the devs and they mentioned a few of the bugs that I had submitted have already been addressed. I'll report back with my findings.

RE: Hours played: I was in both the preview and review periods of the game (which was about a month or so) which is why I have a considerable amount of hours. Not ALL of the hours were 100% playtime of course... things like setting up scenarios for videos, capturing footage, editing... but I would say I probably have at least 300+ hours of playtime in the game.

如果看见我评论的朋友 你在9月9日前 如果你不是脑残粉 或是非常想要 或是就喜欢泰日天 或是蓝精灵团的话 我真的建议退款 别像我们一样


退出游戏后越想越不对劲 越来越不舒服 你说我是个纯粹的锤小白就算了 我也就不在意那么多了 问题我不是 我虽然不是棋子有钱大佬也不是什么翻译庭的神人 但是我至少从战争黎明1开始就喜欢上了这个题材 所以我对于一些本来按道理来说搬到游戏里的一些设定呢就会非常在意了 不多逼逼了 跟你们说道 说道

这里面的星际战士 是新款吧 对吧 原铸星际战士 他们应该更高大 更强壮 更迅捷 那么比起这游戏的1代他们除了画面上呢 你们觉得有啥变化？ 嗯 我觉得反而在这个游戏里 表现力还变弱了 泰日天原铸化后失去了""血神的祝福"" 不会处决回血了 变成可怜兮兮的回甲了 1代也有甲的 比这个耐打3倍 真的是三倍 而且甲的充能速度1代可能是这个的5倍速度 要快的多 是的这里面的新款星际战士脆如纸人 可以被2只刀虫近身后迅速被破甲 嗯是的 不是武士虫哦 是刀虫 而且只需要2只 那么游戏里你基本见到刀虫是多少呢 抱歉 我没去数 反正很多就是了 那么如果俩个武士虫呢？ 当然是你操作不挡直接扑街

好 然后我们的新款星际战士 力量方面呢 嗯 怎么说呢 我该拿那难度4的水准说吗 好吧 反正你没对面马格努斯家崽子的坏罐头厉害就是了 你上去砍半天都不一定能快速解决一个坏罐头 很可能被他反过来解决了 人家可以秒杀你哟 而且你不一定可以秒他哟

然后我们来看看多拉考尔给大家准备的军械武器如何？ 嗯 各种爆矢类武器几乎 难度4的情况下 可能除了那几个特化爆头的还勉强 剩下的全是废的 清杂不行 打精英目标更是可以把你笑抽了 你弹匣打完都不一定做掉2个以上的精英 甚至可能1个都做不掉 因为对方也在移动揍你 但是对面可能击发亵渎的灵能火焰弹几下就可以把你打成齑粉 这就是新武器么 怎么和我看的别人说的官方书上的差异那么大 我觉得还不如1代呢这些枪 甚至我觉得制作组是不是没看过战锤的武器设定？ 当我用热熔枪我就断定了 嗯 制作组只看了图片吧 热熔清理杂兵听那么一回事情的 然后备弹也很符合背景设定 那么实际威力除了清理杂兵其实它威力是最大的 嗯 但是啊 但是 你见过一个武士虫能吃下5发贴脸热熔么？ 嗯坏罐头可以吃7~9发······· 啊啊啊啊啊···笑崩了 对面都是人均大魔么 大魔有的也吃不住贴脸热熔啊··我的天

然后啊 热熔炸弹 嗯 这玩意威力挺好的 然后你拾取后只能带一颗 这些都不是问题 问题是 这玩意你只能原地放下来 然后引爆 是的 你作为一个新款星际战士 半神一样的存在 你连丢个热熔炸弹的力气都没有 可能这个热熔比刽子手背上的生物甲壳重吧~~反正处决时把背上的生物甲壳给单手撕飞了···我看不懂了 这些新的星际战士

然后呢 所谓的原铸装备模块化呢 嗯 在这游戏里变成职业了 是的 你没看错 变成职业了 按道理说 本该是 你有个角色 然后这个角色可以按照你所选的模块化装备来武装成特定的星际战士种类 而不是什么职业 制作组该去看看官方设定去 然后既然变成职业就导致很多武器反而不是模块化配置 变成固定了 比如啊 动力剑 你只有盾卫能用 匪夷所思吧 然后重型爆失步枪啊 只有所谓的战术星际战士能用 啊哈哈啊啊···我想说 制作组连GW官方的新版规则动画都不看的 动画里 10版利维坦大包宣传里 那个是先锋对吧 他手里拿的是什么武器 嗯？制作组 你敢告诉我吗？不知道啊？ 那明显是一把安装了喷火器的重型爆矢步枪~~~懂了吧 各位 也就说 制作组完全没发挥出 原铸星际战士模块化性能 游戏里的先锋是不能用这枪的 然后按道理通用的近战武器也被固定化了 我战术星际战士带个全套可以的吧 抱歉 不行 我盾卫就爱用战斗刀行不行 抱歉 不行····呵呵哒

天赋我就更不想说了 好几个鸡肋的 然后有些叠叠乐 嗯 在怪堆里 又脆 敌人精英一口气来个7~8个 偶尔在再来个特殊怪 还叠叠呢 搞笑呢

然后呢 游戏里有个物品圣物 你可以拾取 拿了以后你可以在倒地后起来 那么搞笑的事情来了 我们用的是原铸星际战士 对吧 那新款星际战士身体里加了个东西 那玩意叫做 贝利萨留炉
好的 实际游戏里 我们是没这个炉子的功能的 再一次的 制作组我想扇捏你们 你们读读书好不
看看规则也行啊~~~ 不知道什么是贝利萨留炉 我会在下面放入原铸星际战士的新三手术说明

然后继续吐槽 处决 完全不如1代 1代你可以通过近战武器造成敌人失恒后对目标进行处决 然后新的这个呢 嗯 这样这样说吧 1代你看见任何几乎所有敌人你都可以让它失衡 不论是原本在那的敌人还是之后刷新出来的敌人 你都可以 但是这个新的星际战士不行 比如小怪杂兵 你只可以失衡原本就在那个地方的 之后怪潮刷出来的杂兵一律不具备失衡条件 就是闪红光 可以处决了 刷出来的怪潮小怪 你最多只能击飞后出发一个枪击处决 而这个枪击处决是有可能被打断的 或是你在怪潮中央用反而得不偿失 接受后你没无敌帧的 但是敌人在你处决时候是一直揍你 运气不好直接要死了 而枪击处决最多给你回一格甲 我上面说了 你脆如纸 1格甲救不了你

也就是说 制作方这个就是个套皮的僵尸世界大战 如果看见我评论的朋友 你在9月9日前 如果你不是脑残粉 或是非常想要 或是就喜欢泰日天 或是蓝精灵团的话 我真的建议退款 然后下面附上原铸的手术三项

肌腱线圈：即使有着远超普通凡人的体质，一名普通星际战士在缺少动力甲和武器的情况下赤手空拳进行战斗仍然会有不小的风险。而肌腱线圈能大幅度增强一名原铸星际战士的体表肌肤和肌肉强度，一名未经改造的凡人在极端愤怒的情况下可能都无法打穿战车的金属外壳或是加固的混泥土墙，但是原铸星际战士可以在平常的状态下就能做到。除此以外，强化的肌肉和皮肤也能更好的保护他们体内的器官和植入物，尤其是与动力甲连接的黑色甲壳。

圣颂垂体：这个只有拇指指甲大小的叶状植入物将被植入大脑的核心部分。它最大的效果是增幅原铸星际战士体内已有的器官，特别是对骨骼和肌肉的强化，这也是为什么原铸星际战士的个头普遍高于普通星际战士的原因。值得一提的是，这个植入器官原本是帝皇本人设计出来用于制造原体的，考尔本人只保有植入右半脑的部分，至于关于左半脑部分的图纸早已无迹可寻。

贝利撒留熔炉：这个平时一直处于休眠的器官被称为“起死回生者”，它同时连接着两颗心脏。当原铸星际战士收到高强度的精神冲击或是创伤的时候，它会释放出类似于抗刺激剂的自制化学物质，这些化学物质也有助于创口再生和唤醒意识。激活一段时间后腺体会再次进入休眠状态，因为它需要时间来分泌和补充物质以便再次激活。包括原铸化后的极限战士战团长卡尔加在内的不少原铸星际战士都因为这个器官逃离了死神的魔爪。 作者：帝皇毒刃不屈要塞号 出处：bilibili














-------------------------------------------------------------------------以下的评论是9月6日的才开始玩的评论
总体玩了下来后 怎么说呢 一言难尽 只能说欧美游戏现在的制作水平是真的一般般了

本身一开始很期待 然后看了泄露版后更期待了 结果到了自己手里就不是那么一回事了

首先是EPIC的问题 我也安装了那个玩意 但是没被它什么不更新啊或是不会下载阻拦 然后小蓝熊默认给这个游戏先扣3分 第一小蓝熊没用 真想作弊的话这玩意很好绕 等于没有

接下来游戏内容 优化方面 一开始加载很慢然后进游戏第一段CG结果居然会卡 感觉还是加载的问题 反正我卡了半天 动画到了中间可能是游戏加载好了 然后就不卡了 进游戏开干的时候挺流畅的 没什么特别的问题

然后就是手感和一代差异性还是挺大的 首先你没处决回血 近战处决是无敌的 但是手枪处决会被打断 我反正被打断过了 然后联机有点不稳定 需要开加速器 近战的重击和轻击都是来自一个按键 对就是你鼠标 你快速轻按是轻击 安定了是重击 这就导致你近战有时候接洽上不够灵活 这点不如一代 而且没有区分俩着的改键选项 你只能去习惯这一点

然后还是处决的问题 就是手枪反击 也就是你躲过或是格挡成功 可以触发一次枪击反击 部分精英敌人可以被2次 然后杂兵基本上就是你格挡成功直接会进入处决秒掉直接 躲闪成功或是击飞可以获得一次枪击处决 但是这个枪击处决就尴尬在有时候 在什么时候很尴尬呢 就是你正在敌群中无双的时候 枪击处决必须等你的当前动作结束 才可以进行 并不像近战一样是可以强行停止动作来进入处决 这就导致比如你一个近战重击计费了敌人 敌人已经出现了枪击的处决的触发按钮 但是你按了没反应 因为动作还没结束 但是当你动作结束时 你可以能就偏移了位置 或是那个敌人超出范围 或是直接判定没能触发 然后从而导致你操作失误被怪围殴 毙命

也就是说 远程处决和你的动作接洽上有问题 如果能直接做成像近战一样可以立即中断当前动作进入处决 那么绝对会很爽 可惜没有


接下来就是联机模式部分 PVE 你没通关战役给你的图好像就只有一张能玩 总共就6个图 然后打了一局 反正经验少的可怜 就算最高难度也不会多少 然后武器和天赋方面 超级肝的 武器要材料 反正我打了一把 没见到就是了 对 不一定给你 然后0军团皮肤什么的大多数你可以通关通关获得的经验来解锁 但是精英装束就要通关特定要求了 比如通关次数啊这类的

总体而已就是可能除了画面和皮肤上的自定义以及武器的特性强化方面 其他都不如1代来的好玩 比如武器携带方面 我算上你的手枪也就3个武器 比1代还少一个 然后就是近战轻重击按键也是不如1代 1代是两个分开的按键 手感偏软反正 你看别人玩可能觉得很爽 但你自己上手 emmm就一言难尽

在此我只想说 9月9日还没到 打算9月9日玩的朋友 如果你不是锤粉 我的建议是退款 战锤40K类游戏 这款只能算是平庸之作吧 本以为是今年小黑马 但是看来不是 这游戏可以玩 但是不一定真的多好玩 只想过剧情的朋友 我建议是等打折 就这种体量水平的话 估计半年左右就会打折了 不用急着入 并不是太值得首发就买的游戏",2024/9/6,zh-cn
Brokeback Morgan,0,18,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Menua/,"I know I going to be on the unpopular side here, but I just want anyone thinking of buying the game to get the chance to see a review that tells it like it is.

I have never played a 40k game before, so without any passion or connection to the universe, I only can judge this game off of what it provides to me. This game is... not horrible, but it certainly isn't great either.

The campaign is short. Very short by today's standards. Like 6 hours, short. I finished in one sitting after work. Now, this isn't horrible, but it since the campaign is arguably the best part of the game, it being that short doesn't really bode well. Fun combat, great visuals, and an entertaining story... that you'll be done with at the end of the day.

Multiplayer is, well, not as great. The operations are interesting at best, monotonous at worst. You essentially get to play through a co-op mission of the campaign as the ""B-team"" that you would always order to go do stuff. It provides an interesting and new perspective, but is certainly nothing great. The ""endless"" war multiplayer, I.E the PvP, is fun for about, well, 2 days. Afterwards you realize you only have 3 game modes on 3 maps. It gets repetitive instantly.

Now I know what you're gonna say, ""oh but there will be updates, and look at the roadmap!"". My brother, you are paying $60 at least for a 6 hour campaign and lackluster multiplayer that you will get tired of in two days.",2024/9/7,en

In più il fatto che non ci sia contaminazione woke è assolutamente un enorme pregio.
Detto questo posso affermare che il gioco è un ottimo gioco anche se, per la mancanza di contenuto, aspetterei qualche sconto per comprarlo se non vi interessa di supportare i devs e di impartire una sonora lezione alla SBI e a chi ci perde soldi appresso",2024/9/10,it
Seortan,0,21.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992417260/,"На текущий момент:

На высоких уровнях игра превращается в Elden Ring: Бесконечные увороты и перекаты. Не сложно а просто не весело.

Болтерное оружие абсолютно бесполезное. Плазмаган бесполезен. Оружие ближнего боя в большей части бесполезно.

Мельтаган лучше всех остальных опций за счет большого урона и восстановления даже потерянного здоровья если у тебя есть хотя бы капелька белого.

Некоторые классы, например штурмовик, просто хуже других опций: Какой смысл от него если вангард делает все лучше него? Джетпак очень занерфлен.

Класс лок в операциях весьма дурацкое решение: Хочешь играть на высокой сложности? Качай 2 класса минимум иначе будешь стоять по 5 минут в гляделки с еще одним тактиком в отряде.

Баланс противников очень странный: Тзаангоры со щитами выдерживают ударом силовым кулаком в лицо. Простой воин нидов выдерживает 4 выстрела мельтагана в лицо. Враги очень точно стреляют и отказываются драться в ближнем бою даже вплотную, предпочитая пятиться и стрелять пока игроку приходится кувыркаться вперед поскольку у большинства оружия ближнего боя нет моментума вперед на атаках.

Геймплейный дизайн очень странный тоже: Какой смысл от ган страйка если окно неуязвимости такое маленькое? Какой смысл от него если самые простые тираниды снимают броню за 1 удар? Механика парирования классная но работает только в 1 на 1 или 2 на 1. Больше? Можно даже не пытаться. Плюс зачем вообще парировать когда увороты делают тоже самое только работают еще и на красные атаки которые нельзя спарировать?

ПВП это вообще тихий ужас: Вангард максимально сломанный класс. Крюк-> Стреляешь в упор из карабина и выигрываешь дуэль 1 на 1 с любым классом. Против булварка просто пятишься и делаешь крюк еще раз если он поднял щит. Большинство дальнобойного оружия имеет выше дпс чем оружие ближнего боя поэтому в упор лучше просто стрелять поскольку нет прерывания анимаций. Поэтому на текущий момент пвп это просто беготня и стрельба из карабинов в упор по большей части.

Кампания: В целом хорошо сделано но если играть на 3+ сложности то опять получается Elden Ring а не симулятор космодеса что портит ощущения. Боты абсолютно бесполезные и тупые поэтому на них можно даже не рассчитывать.

Кастомизация: В целом хорошо. Расцветки и возможность комбинировать цвета это весьма клево. Текущие куски брони на каждый класс выглядят хорошо но откровенно говоря мало. По сути самый последний тир косметики это просто 1-й тир обвешанный печатями и прочим. Средне в целом, хотелось бы больше.

Операции: В целом интересные. Но отсутствие директора иишки ощущается. Становятся сильно однообразными буквально на 4-й заход. Отсутствие специалистов и большего разнообразия элитных противников сказывается негативно на общем впечатлении. Плюс опять же, из за высокой сложности часто просто пробегаешь мимо противников до лифта/скрипта поскольку экономика здоровья и брони отсутствует на высоких сложностях операций. Если говорить про билды персонажей то тут все скудно. Никаких геймплейно изменяющих элементов в прокачке оружия и классов нет. Очень унылые ""5% больше урона"" или крайне редко что то в духе ""Получаете 1 полный магазин при низком уровне здоровья"".

В целом я разочарован тем как вышел СМ2. Им стоит сильно поработать над геймплейным дизайном и поведением противников и общим балансом. На текущий момент людям все нравится но данные проблемы очень сильно начнут бить по продолжительности жизни игры буквально через месяц после релиза если не делать изменения.",2024/9/10,ru

NixEmotions,0,20.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nixemo/,"I am quite impressed with this game both in terms of its gameplay and visuals after finishing the introduction. I'm excited to start playing the rest of the game in co-op with my sister. However, I cannot ever recommend a game that forcibly installs unnecessary Epic Games bloatware on your PC upon initial launch. I bought* a Steam game to play with other players on Steam only. (*Well actually, my lovely sister gifted me the game, but my statement remains otherwise the same. Thank you so much, sis! ^-^)

Fortunately, as long as you don't care about crossplay, the game is entirely functional without Epic Games Online and it can be easily removed from the installation. Here's how to do so.

1) Launch the game. The game will immediately attempt to install Epic Online Services. Cancel the installation box before it finishes. You will be met with an error message upon reaching the main menu. The EOS was never successfully installed, but remnants of the software are still on your machine.
2) Turn off crossplay in the game options menu of the game.
3) Close the game. Uninstall Epic Online Services from the list of programs on your computer.
4) Delete the Epic Online Services folder from the game's installation folder in your Steam library.
5) Reboot your computer and relaunch the game. The game will greet you with the error message when you reach the main menu whenever you start the game, but EOS will never again attempt to install itself on your machine. The game is fully functional without crossplay. Enjoy Space Marine 2!",2024/9/10,en
YuGo_Wolverino,1,13,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ydemonhunter/,"Prós:
+ A campanha, apesar de curta, é bem fod@.
+ As armaduras parecem realmente pesadas e isso reflete no combate. Você sente o peso na gameplay.
+ O combate é intenso, pesado e lento (no bom sentido) e por isso é quase que estratégico. O combate de Space Marine 2 lembra um pouco Gears of War e Darksiders 1. Uma pegada meio old school.
+ Horda de inimigos.
+ Modo COOP. Você pode jogar a campanha inteira em coop. Você + 2 amigos.
+ Excelente Direção de Arte. Os cenários são lindíssimos.
+ Bons gráficos.
+ Boa trilha sonora.
+ Esse jogo tem mais testosterona que todos os jogos da Ubisoft juntos.
+ A lacração da ""Games Workshop"" (empresa responsável pela franquia Warhammer e que hoje abraçou a cultura woke com força) não chegou em Space Marine 2, jogo desenvolvido pela Saber Interactive. Então Space Marine 2 RESPEITA a LORE da franquia.

Contras:
- Campanha curta. A campanha pode durar de 6~10h, dependendo da dificuldade e a forma como você joga.
- Os efeitos de sangue, quando você atira nos inimigos ou despedaça eles é muito cartoonesco. Podia ser um pouco mais realista. Mas isso é só questão de gosto pessoal mesmo. Mas o gore do jogo ainda é muito bom.
- Apesar de uma quantidade muito boa de horda de inimigos, eles tem poucas variações.
- O modo ""Operações"" (PVE) e ""Eternal War"" (PVP) são apenas repetições. Se quiser estender as horas de jogo você vai jogar esses modos até cansar. Para aqueles que, assim como eu, não se importam com o PVP, já é menos conteúdo ainda.
- Edições Gold e Ultra (são claramente conteúdos retirados do jogo base pra poder vender essas edições estúpidas por um preço exorbitante)
- Season Pass. E as Seasons que estão por vir. São mais conteúdos retirados do jogo base, afim de estender a vida útil do jogo.
- PASSE DE BATALHA em jogo SINGLEPLAY é de CAIR O CUH DO PALHAÇO!
- Pagar pra jogar antes. O famigerado Early Access (ou early unlock). Ubisoft e EA fazendo escola.

Você quer esperar até 2025 pra jogar o jogo completo? Faça isso. Mas jogue! Vale muito a pena.",2024/9/8,pt

ReapersGambit,0,47.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198432384759/,I overall love this game but ive taken my thumbs up away until you either nerf the power fist weapon in pvp or the bulwark class. The stats for powerfist look bad but yet im watching people 1 shot any class with it even heavy and bulwark classes. So youve put a talentless weapon on a low skill class. Either the power fist needs heavy nerfs to oblivion or you need to nerf bulwark so that its shield can only take so many hits before needing to recharge similar to heavy class in pvp. Theres no reason a class is having god mode in a frontal cone and then just 1 shotting people on repeat. Fix this and you earn your thumbs up back.,2024/9/10,en

idiot doom spiral,0,18.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theninewalkers/,"i wish steam had an in-between option for reviews, because while the gameplay is fun, i don't think it's worth the price with the current level of content. there's a fairly short (6 mission) campaign, 6 operations missions which play out alongside the main campaign, and a barebones PVP mode which is okay. The combat is good but can be a bit janky, especially the melee combat. the control scheme isn't great for mouse & keyboard and was obviously designed with console controllers in mind. I had a few weird bugs, including character/weapon/enemy models becoming invisible & connection issues trying to play operations with a friend, but i appreciate it's still very early days and these will likely be fixed. i'll almost definitely come back to this game in future if/when they add more content, but currently it's far too expensive for what you get.",2024/9/9,en

This trend of corporatocracy needs to stop. I shouldnt need 3 accounts (steam, epic, saber) with 6 EULAs (steam account, epic account, saber account, in-game EULA, steam purchase EULA, epic service EULA, and maybe more that I forgot) just to have my consumer rights degraded. Forced arbitration, not actually owning the media you buy, and having to run what surmounts to spyware even for single player, battlepasses and predatory monetization everywhere. None of this should be normalized. This game is fun but I can not recommend this game to my friends as I am tired of supporting this regime of predation. And before any commenters say this is hyperbolic or developer PR adds the technical excuses, just remember, games were fun and sold well for the last few decades without all this BS. We live in a golden age of media yet insist on tarnishing it.

P.S. An extra $30 and I still have to grind just to paint my guy purple?! No, thanks. Yes, I know you can run without EGS, but it still installs EGS dependencies.

ɆxⱣɍømɨ,1,28.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sad_without_you/,"Главное - покупая эту игру понимать, что ты покупаешь.


 Время прохождения сюжета - 6 часов.


ПРЕДИСЛОВИЕ:
НЕ ИДИТЕ ИГРАТЬ В ПВЕ МИССИИ ПОКА НЕ ПРОЙДЁТЕ 2-3 СЮЖЕТНЫХ МИССИЙ, ВЫ ЗАРУИНИТЕ ВСЕЙ КОМАНДЕ КАТКУ, ИГРА ХАРДКОРНАЯ.

Сюжет тут для галочки.
Нужен лишь для ФАНАТОВ и для знакомства с механиками (в том числе с классами).
Весь сюжет - это обучение и подготовка к ПВЕ.


✅
Орды мобов, кровище, расчленёнка.


✅
2к, ультры, 50 фпс с исходным масштабированием (самое минимальное).
На 6750 GRE.

Правда количество экранов загрузки бесит.


✅
Думал что ""втупую"" можно будет бежать, а тут очень надо думать как поступить.

Часто проверяется твоя реакция.
Сделать ИДЕАЛЬНОЕ парирование, ИДЕАЛЬНОЕ уклонение.

В награду ты получаешь ячейку броню.


✅
У тебя мало хп, у врагов много урона, на самой ЛЁГКОЙ сложности в ПВЕ миссии тебе сносят 50% твоих хп за удар.

Это интересно тем, что ты становишься зависим от команды, вы не сможете пройти миссию, если будете играть каждый сам за себя.

Хилиться можно только эсту... ой, ШПРИЦАМИ, которые раскиданы в углах.

За снайпера важна позиционка, потому что снайпер ватный и за снайпера важен аим.
Количество брони зависит от класса.



⚡
Не ставлю диз, потому что это онлайн игра.

Для онлайн игры он даже не плох, но его миссии это ""обороняй генератор"" и условно за одну миссию ты 5 раз защищаешь что-то от орд врагов.

Для сюжета могли бы что-то интереснее придумать, головоломки разные.

В сюжете нету никакой прогрессии, вся прокачка в ПВЕ миссиях.
ПВЕ миссии интереснее сюжетных, с уникальными боссами и погодными условиями.
Чего стоит эпичная миссия с драконом, который всю локу огнём поливает.


⚡
Всего 50 гигов весит игра.
Локации красивые, по дизайну, но текстуры это 2015 год, потому что даже Ассасин Одиссея имеет круче графику.

Модельки пластилиновые, очень хорошо это заметно по волосам, от которые ОТРАЖАЕТСЯ СВЕТ.
СВЕТ ОТ ВОЛОС.


⚡
Не влияет на геймплей, но влияет на погружение.
Её нет.
Задеваешь бочку - бочка улетает на соседнюю локацию.

Огромные двери, которые весят несколько тонн открываются как пластиковые дверцы.



❌
На данный момент в игре 6 ПВЕ миссий.
Проходишь их все на хардкоре - считай прошёл всю игру.
Дальше тебе остаётся лишь прокачивать каждый класс, путем перепрохождения этих же самых миссий, в которых один и тот же сценарий.


❌
Фу.
Во-первых в игре мало окружающих звуков.
Во-вторых те, что есть не имеют объёма, не имеют пространственности.
Выстрелы не дают вибрацию.
Топот брони тоже из 2015 года.

Музыка незаметна.


❌
Очень скудно.

Большой минус игры.
У классов на выбор 3 основных оружия (которое может повторяться у разных классов)
и 1 слот под мили + 1 слот под пистолет, где уже выбора нет.

То есть играя за снайпера я не могу выбрать себе 2 и 3 оружие, у других классов так же.
Ты бегаешь то, с чем тебя дают.

В целом оружий около 15 видов и это такое оружие
""Болт-1"" магазин 12 патронов, урон 4.
""Болт-2"" магазин 36 патронов, урон 2.
""Болт-3"" магазин 500 патронов, большая отдача.


❌
Челы сразу регают ПВЕ миссию, не разобравшись с механиками игры, их убивают - и они ливают.

Нужны наказания за выход из матча и ограничение чтобы на высокую сложность не прокали челы с 1 лвлом.


❌
Сильная халтура
Редкий скин оружия - печать висит у ствола.
Легендарный - печать висит у курка.

Редкий скин брони - верёвка белого цвета.
Легендарный - верёвка красного цвета.
Висит верёвка в таком же положении.


❌
Хотелось бы, для знакомства со вселенной БЕСТИАРИЙ?
Что мы за отряд?
Чё это за враги?
Почему мы сражаемся с ними?
Откуда они взялись?

В игре есть аудио-дневники, и всё. (они кстати хорошо прописаны, в стиле рассказа историй, а не чьих-то мыслей)


❌
Способствую никакущему сюжету.
""Должно быть это какая-то ошибка""
""Я не остановлюсь, пока не убью всех до последнего"".

Куча клишированных фраз, которые используются в играх и фильмах для ""Нагнетания напряжённого момента"".
Я же ловлю дикий кринж от этого.


❌
Шёл 2024 год, разработчики игр до сих пор не умели прописывать интеллект ни мобам ни союзникам.

Боты кроме как поднять тебя ничего не могут.
Враги не тригерятся на них, умышленно оббегают и бегут к игрокам.
Сами боты не могут казнить оглушённых врагов и перестают стрелять в них.
У ботов в целом порезан урон и повышена выживаемость.


❌
СКМ - прицел.
ПКМ - удар мили.
С - парирование

Я бы сделал СКМ - ульта, ПКМ - прицел, Q - удар мили.


❌
Подожди, пока пройдёт диалог (в ПВЕ миссии, которую нужно проходить 20+ раз).
Подожди, пока подымитесь на лифте.
Подожди, пока откроется дверь.

The Mogician,0,60,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198851368116/,"Very tough decision for me to give this a not recommended review, but I think there are some glaring issues that should be addressed.

First off, the pros:
1. It looks great. Starting from the bigger things. The game is set on three very different and distinct planets: Kadaku, a jungle world, Avarax, a hive world and Demerium, a cemetery world. Each of the planets have their very own distinct style and feel to it. Then down to the smaller details. There are a lot of details in the game that also breath life into the game and adds to the whole WH40K experience. Bravo.
2. The gameplay is great. If you enjoyed the first space marine game, odds are, you will enjoy this one as well. The melee and shooting all feel very satisfying. Popping off a headshot or pulling off a finisher all feel very satisfying.
3. The story is pretty good. I mean, Warhammer games are not always known for having interesting stories, especially also considering this game is supposed to be a hack and slash kinda brainless fun game. All in all, I enjoyed the story thus far. Additional points go to the fact that the coop missions are also parallel to the main missions.

Next, onto the cons:
1. The story is a bit short for its price. There are 7 main story missions (8 if you count prologue) and 5 coop missions that will help flesh out the main story missions (6 if you count Ballistic engine, which isn't really mentioned anywhere in the main missions). I did the game on Angels of Death difficulty and it should take about 15 hours to complete. If you count the coop missions in, it should take about 25-30 hours in total if you wanna enjoy the whole story at least once. Slightly on the short side for the price they are charging.
2. It can be a real grindfest. Tying into the last point. What it does not have in length, it makes up for the sheer amount of grind you will need to do. To unlock all the armor sets for each class, you need to play 35 matches per class, with a total of 210 matches. Assuming you don't do PvP like I do, let's assume each match takes 30 minutes (I think that's the bare minimum unless you do speedrun), and you win every single match. That is like 100+ hours right there that requires you to grind. Now, I'm not against having a lot of coop time to pad out the game time, but since there are only six maps, things can get stale real soon. I hate doing comparisons, but If you compare it with games like Vermintide 2. Vermintide 2 had 13 missions in total when it first launched, which will ensure a relatively healthy mix of varied missions. Here's hoping the devs would add in more coop missions down the line.
3. Twitch drops. Really? I mean, all the clown awards that went into the announcement post should be telling. It is one thing to do exclusive twitch drops that requires you to watch it (since you can just leave it in the background), it is altogether another to require people subbing and giving out subscriptions. This is toxic.

All in all, I enjoyed the game itself, but I really do not enjoy some of the other decisions the devs made for the game.",2024/9/10,en

低轨道悍匪,0,19,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199001223593/,"首先，如果你是看了网上众多UP评测的视频说，射爆爽砍，星际战士打爆一切来的，我现在立刻劝你放弃购买，这绝对不是让你爽的游戏，星际战士脆如纸品，爆弹枪的威力就像滋水，一共就四五个弹夹的备弹，整整三十枪打在对面精英身上才能打红，高难度一刷就是四五个精英加天上的脑虫，你还得省子弹对付天上的目标
如果你想靠进展接潮直接冲进虫群大杀四方我建议你不要幻想了，这游戏的弹反和闪避都有巨大问题，可以被包围你的小兵打断，还会被你自己的挥刀动作打断，而且虫群各种背后攻击，围殴，根本无法好好拼刀，枪决没有无敌更是负收益，不小心在近战中按出来会被直接围殴致死
人物动作本身就及其僵硬，出刀连段和闪避弹反取消的优先级也做得稀烂，一旦再被打中一两下就会被硬直打断所有操作，然后直接被控到死，
目前网上打高难度都是直接特战兵加热熔枪，全程无交互，一路喷到关底，不使用任何近战机制才是最稳妥的方案

Huru2ryousan Watch&SafetyPatrol,1,30.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OPMALLDEAD/,"某大塚VCでWorldWarZに筋肉を追加して敵が凶悪になった感じ
なのでWorldWarZが好きだった人は問題なく脳が筋肉と偽りの皇帝への忠誠心で薙ぎ払っていくスタイルも受け入れができると思うゾ。というより開発一緒なのでキャラクターと敵を40Kにしてるから美少女もいない。なんか聞いたことある声だらけで凄くWARHAMMERが出世したと実感できるゾ。ディアゴ〇ティーニのお陰だな！

EPIC ONLINE SERVICEが初回起動時に強制インストールされるのでクロスプレイしないなら手動で消す必要がある。ついでにSSD以外に入れたらまともに動かない
RAM16GB位は食い尽くしてるから32GB以上にした方がいいゾ。最近APEX用にPCを買いdiscordを使っている環境ではかなりギリギリになるので今後のゲームの為にも増設した方がいいゾ。

ストーリーは？
WARHAMMER40Kを知らない場合、ストーリーは置いてけぼりになりそうな感じがあるけど、詳しく知りたい場合はミニチュアゲームに足を踏み込むことになるので考えない方がいいゾ。
今作を簡単に説明すると

イナゴが来たから駆除が一番わかりやすい。

戦闘システムとかは？
オープンワールドではないゾ。ステージ形式で黒神話悟空みたいに迷子になることはないゾ。
基本的にはボルターという銃と拾った銃の２個、近接武器１個なので装備の幅としては少ないゾ。
大立ち回りをしながら回避、パリィ、カウンターをしながら戦うスタイルだゾ。
敵を倒すとアーマーが回復するのでスペースマリーンらしく攻撃的なプレイになるゾ。
反射神経必須に感じるけどちゃんと青、黄色、赤と警告がでてるので対応するボタンポチーしたら自動でやってくれるゾ。
いつも通りの目分量適当調整なので気にする人は向いてないゾ。

マウスホイール押し込んでADSするのに慣れないと近接武器を突然振り始めるのはみんな通る道だゾ。




Q.なんか値段高くない？
A.ミニチュアも1個で似た金額だから安い。
スペースマリーン複数とティラニド網羅してるから1万円で15万円分の価値はある。
無料ゲームに慣れ過ぎだゾ。（4日の先行アクセスの為だけにゴールドエディションをギフトで配りながら）

A.ALT TABで起動待機中に別の事をやると動かなくなる。ゲーム開始後のムービーでクラッシュする場合はプリセットが低になってないかを確認する。最初のムービーだけ画質が違うので低プリセットの720pにしてる場合、1920*1080に変更し、いったんメモリに全部読み込ませた方がいい。メモリ性能が低い可能性があるので、惑星が映った瞬間にESCで一時停止して1~2分位待機してから再生するとスムーズに進める。15万くらいのPCだと大体安いメモリだから読み込みが遅い。ムービーを突破したら設定をする。
特に最低要求のパソコンの場合、8GBのメモリになるので更に読み込みが遅くなるので放置したほうがいい。今時8GBでゲームするのならAPEX Legendsに籠ってた方がいい。わざわざメモリ抜いてまで確認したんだから褒めろ。褒めて。

それでもダメなら
forza horizon5の時の裏技を駆使し、インターネット回線抜いてオフライン環境でスキップする。それ以外なら知らん。どうせアバストだろ

設定にある布の動きの～設定を下げる。その辺の旗や肩についてるレシートなども対象になってるぽい。後はロード時にメモリに全部データを保管して読み込んでいる感があるのでメモリも容量増やした方がいいゾ。
それ以外には青い熊さんがエルデンリングと同じ理由だと思うゾ。
独り言だけどEACのアフェニティルールを変更してCPUシングルコアに対象変更すると幸せになれるかもしれない。マルチプレイ逝ったらしーらない。素直に更新待った方がいいゾ


これじゃスペースマリーンじゃなくてステルスマリーンだね！グラボのメモリが最低要件以下（4GB等）だと発生する。フレンド用メモ
・GPUのドライバーverが最新化確認する。
・何故かプリセット低設定では何も描画されなくなるので中設定に警告が出てきても無視して変更後、手動で設定をする。
・プリセット中 FSR 低テクスチャで大体なんとかなる
・60fps制限で低テクスチャにする。心配なら他も低に変更していく
・TAAにするとなぜか上回ってるグラボでも消える
↑で解決しない場合


になってるぐらいなので修正待ちかグラボが最低要件以下のどちらかの可能性があるゾ



Q.スペースマリーンの強さって？
A.一般兵士と比較した場合、ドラゴンボールのナッパとクリリン位の差がある程度には強い。

Q.なんか銃弱くない？
A.弾のサイズはよくあるFPSみたいな5.56mmではなく、お店で売っている「黒色で緑の3本縦線がある缶」とほぼ同じ大きさなので威力として超高いゾ。
ちなみにそこら辺で倒れている一般兵士はよくある弾から、翼を授ける缶位の大きさの弾を使ってる。
単純に相手が悪いだけだゾ。

異端審問官だった人はわかるけどクソデカボルターを無反動で片手撃ちしてるゾ。アレの強さを知ってるなら異端審問官の相手はお遊戯会だゾ。ダークタイドにマリーンいなくてよかったね。速攻鎮圧されてたゾ。

Q.何で少数で出撃するの？
A.スペースマリーン100人で師団クラスの戦力で、育成とかが10年単位で反逆されないよう洗脳も含めてで増えにくい為、人員不足と過労気味。何処かのスーパーアースのように誰でも志願したら採用されるわけでもないので結構ジリ貧気味。ちなみにアーマーは職人の手作りで生産性もカス。
追い打ちで縦にも横にもデカイ重いで輸送機にも数人しか入らない。
という欠点を補える位には単体の戦闘力が本来はクソ高い。
何故かゲーム内では数回殴られたら死ぬけど。

Q.肩とかにレシートついてるけど
A.良くアレの正式名称忘れるからレシートって呼んでる。レシートでいいよ。
純潔の印だかプリティシールだとかそんなの。要は営業マンとかの売り上げ順位トップでもらう表彰状とかと同じ。

Q.機械精霊って何？
A.わかりやすく言うと不具合やバグなどの動作不良だゾ。修正する技術はなくなったので祈るという動作で「どうか壊れないでクレメンス・・・」な感じでグリスアップしたり、放置で放電や冷却してるゾ。

Q.スペースマリーンってハイテク兵士だよね？
A.実はあの世界基準で見たら若干時代遅れ気味。

Q.ドレッドノート先輩は？
A.いる　205Ｐに勝てる


Q.もしかしてブラック
A.少し前に大量転職した。

Q.チュートリアル後の会話で18の機能って？
A.




















Q.やっぱりブラックじゃない？
A.だから大量転職したって

Q.オペレーションモードってCOOPは？
A.現状プライベートロビーがない。クラス被りは許されないので野良に参加するか、自分がホストするか、フレンド集めるかの３択をしながらホスト以外はクラス被りしてると永遠にマッチしないのでコロコロクラスを変えながらマッチ待機する。野良参加でホストが走って行ってダウンして抜けるか、自分がホストして自慢げに進行する野良がダウンしていなくなるか、固めて疑似プライベートロビーにするかの３択

Q.PvPは触れてないけどやらないの？
A.プライベートロビー実装されたら12人でやるので今の所興味がない。DoWとかでバランスがゴミカスなのも知ってるゾ。似たコンセプトでのGearsで破綻してたのも知ってるから余計に興味がないゾ。
Quakeとかみたいなガチガチのアリーナなら興味あるけど最近のAPEXから参入したキルモンタージュ程度で盛り上がるガキのような集団とは特に戯れたくないが本音(直球)
1VS1が実装されたら本格的にはやると思う。


ちなみにワイは



キャンペーンは楽しかった以外特に触れない場合。
クリア後にはゲーム進行やキャラクター育成の手段としてキャンペーンがまったく役に立たないチュートリアルという事実と少し時代遅れ気味なPvEマッチメイキングモードと、キャラクターの進行とリプレイ性のためのカスタマイズが備わっているゾ。
WH40Kしてるとなると一番わかりやすいのがDarktideに似たモードで、現時点では 6 つのマップしかない。 比較するとかなり必要最低限なのは、複数の種類のモードを提供しようとしているからだと思うぞ。PvPはゴミだけど。実績取ったら二度とやらないと思うけどプライベートロビー実装されたら解除用でやるレベル

他のcoopとの最大の違いは、受け流し/カウンター、回避、豆鉄砲、そして一般的な戦闘の流れが異なって機能する戦闘ゲームプレイだゾ。
実際に慣れるまでの最初の1～2時間は、戦闘がちょっと微妙だと思ってたゾ。
テンポ、攻撃優先順位、所持する武器によるプレイスタイルの違い、慣れてくると楽しくなる。
オペレーションモードではチームプレイが要求され、難易度が高いほどレベリングが必要になり口頭でのコミュニケーションが求められるゾ。野良でワイが上記のCOOPの文句書いてた位だし。失敗しても経験値もらえるけどソロで駆け抜けて一気に稼ぎたい。

戦闘について不平を言っている人は、操作に慣れていない問題であると思うゾ
ゲームの核となる知識と操作スキルが伴ってくると楽しくなるだろうけど無理そうなら返金したらいいゾ

魅力的かどうかはわからないけど設定と全体的なアートデザインでもいいゾ。
環境、アーキテクチャ、キャラクター (主にスペースマリンコ) のデザインは、十分な性能のPCを持っている場合は、現状最高のスペースマリーン体験入隊ごっことミニチュアの塗装資料になる。

キャンペーン、COOP、PvP など全コンテンツに興味があるのであれば、このゲームは現在の価格に見合った価値があると思うゾ。COOPのみに興味がある場合は、それでも価値があるかもしれないけど、もう少し充実したコンテンツが提供されるまで待つことをお勧めするゾ (おそらくセールで安くなるし)PvEではリプレイ性はほとんどレベリング以外なく、ロードマップを見ると、これは変わらないと思うし、マップごとに異なる目的が考えられるので、同じマップでも異なる体験ができることを期待し、発売当初は6マップでいいと思ってたんです。
まさかリプレイ価値のない6つの固定ミッションになるとは思ってなかったゾ。

リプレイって意味ではボーダーランズ2やレムナント2のようなゲームを検索してみるといいゾ。





WWZの発売後のコンテンツの内容を理解してて追加ペースが許せるとかであればすぐに購入してもいいと思うゾ。",2024/9/6,ja

퍼즐이나 길 찾기 없이 돌격하며 직진하면 진행되는 상남자식 캠페인 진행 방식도 굉장히 만족스러웠습니다. 전투 스타일과 게임 분위기와도 잘 맞더라고요. 전투를 벌이는 각각의 공간들도 압도적으로 아름다우며 구석구석 신경 쓴 티가 나는 장식들도 눈을 뗄 수 없게 합니다. 신성 로마 제국을 연상케 하는 문화와 디자인 콘셉트도 흥미로운 볼거리고요.

캠페인은 8시간 가량에 엔딩을 볼 수 있어 그리 길지는 않지만, 엔드 콘텐츠는 PvE와 PvP로 따로 있습니다. 캠페인에서는 써볼 수 없었던 무기도 있고 기술도 여러 가지가 추가돼서 캠페인과는 다른 재미가 있고, 여섯 개의 직업을 전부 키운다면 플레이 타임도 엄청나게 늘어날 것 같더라고요. 다만 너무 반복적이긴 해서 제 취향은 아니었는데, 캐릭터 성장을 위해 반복 플레이하는 과정을 평소에도 즐기는 편이라면 할 만할 것도 같습니다.

이 정도면 IP 기반의 게임은 물론이고 매번 이렇다 할 성과를 내지 못해 온 워해머의 디지털 게임들 중 아주 바람직한 케이스가 아닐까 싶습니다. 얼마나 워해머 시리즈를 좋아하고 마초적인 캐릭터와 전투 방식을 선호하느냐에 따라 만족도는 달라질 수 있겠지만, 캠페인이 전부인 게임은 아님에도 캠페인만 보더라도 플레이 할 가치가 있는 게임이라고 생각합니다.

Кампания пройдена и ощупаны PvE и PvP режимы: сюжетка понравилась, хотя ничего такого там прям вау нет, больше как сервис и раскрытие персонажей. Опять будет тот самый артефакт из первой части, опять будет хаос и опять мы всех спасем. Концовка открытая и намекает на длс или сиквел.

Операции интересные, разнообразные, с реюзом локаций из компании, только чутка переработаные, эпика более чем хватает, разнообразны и проходить интересно. Орденов для внешек много, жаль нет Серых Рыцарей. За операции прокачиваются оружки, дают валюту и опыт для перков, всяких открываемых внешек и прочего, зависнуть можно на долго. 6 классов, ощущаются по разному, есть испытания с мини-обучением.

A 3 Minute Review of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. An incredibly satisfying and highly detailed sequel. Support the channel, become a member!


Written Review
Space Marine 2 is a highly-polished and satisfying sequel to the original 2011 game.

This is one the coolest looking 40K games I've played. It truly immerses you in its grimdark world with its stunning environments, attention to lore, meaty audio and intriguing narrative.

The game comes with three modes, the first being the campaign, which is playable solo, or in a 3 person squad with friends. It follows Titus, the protagonist from the first game, as he embarks on missions to take out a new Tyrannid threat.

Each of these missions have you fight through a variety of level layouts with their own unique aesthetic. As you progress the campaign and explore slightly off the beaten path, you'll gain access to a decently-sized arsenal of weapons that come with unique movesets and playstyles.

Space Marine 2 trains you to continuously juggle between ranged and melee combat, as different enemies will have different weaknesses that you need to take advantage of. Ammunition is more scarce than you might expect, and you won't be able to take out an entire horde purely with your guns.

There are many bigger enemies that fight you up-close, and parrying their attacks, and breaking through their defences with your melee weapon can prove to be your most effective means of taking them down.

Melee combat feels great, and comes with a good number of combos and freedom. It also has a very important role in keeping you alive, as executing low-health enemies grants you some armor and regenerates recently-damaged health.

This dance throughout combat was incredibly satisfying to me, and as you get better at it, you really feel empowered. Despite this, it felt like I could die in any fight. I was often barely hanging by a thread by the end of combat, at least on the game's recommended Veteran difficulty. Missions are long and arduous, but in a good way, and due to this continuous struggle, success was very fulfilling.

The second game mode is called ""Operations"", and is also a 1-3 player PvE mode. It includes unique missions separate from the campaign, where you can play as distinct classes with their own unique abilities. The cool part here, is that there is some meta progression. As you play, you can upgrade your weapons, put points into your skill trees, and unlock new cosmetics.

The third game mode is called Eternal War, and is your relatively run-of-the-mill PvP mode, with expected game modes like deathmatch and capture points. You play with the same class types mentioned in Operations. It can be quite fun, but in my opinion, is not the main attraction of the game.

Overall, I think Space Marine 2 feels wonderful to play, and is an absolute blast with friends. The attention to detail, and weight in everything you do really makes it a joy to play.",2024/9/9,en

Lu λ,1,39.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GORDOCOMPUX/,"Este juego es una maravilla; es posiblemente uno de los mejores títulos que haya salido este año, totalmente un 10 de 10. Este juego es un tipo Gears of War con varias mecánicas diferentes, pero en sí es igual de frenético.

Comenzando con mi reseña: La historia continúa en cierta parte la historia de su predecesor. Si bien no es necesario jugar el anterior, puede ser útil para entender ciertos aspectos de la historia. Siguiendo con la historia, esta tiene una buena forma de desarrollarse, donde cada cinemática o diálogo nuevo hace que la historia sea más atrapante. A su vez, los personajes son muy importantes en el desarrollo de la misma historia, ya que algo que me gusta que hace este juego es desarrollar bastante a los personajes del escuadrón principal, como en el primer juego, dándoles más peso sin dejarlos de lado como BOTS que te acompañan en las misiones. Las misiones, cuya característica es el escenario perfectamente ambientado que posee este juego, los gráficos y la construcción de escenarios de este juego son hermosos. Los escenarios son lineales, pero poseen cierta construcción que te invita a explorarlos y encontrar cosas bastante útiles. Además, los escenarios son bastante intuitivos. Si bien el juego tiene una opción de brújula, normalmente no la usé por lo intuitivo que es el escenario y novedoso.
Los enemigos que posee este juego son bastante variados y están colocados muy bien en cada escenario para evitar esa sensación de repetitividad que puede llegar a dar este tipo de juegos. Cada enemigo presenta un nivel de dificultad distinto al otro, dando paso muy importante al cambio de estrategias constante y al uso constante de su sistema de parry y de esquive, sistema que se complementa muy bien con el gameplay, el cual está muy bien pulido y se siente bien de usar. Tal vez en teclado podría mejorar un poco algunos mapeos de teclas, pero están bastante bien de igual manera. Volviendo con el gameplay, este es muy parecido al de GOW, como mencioné anteriormente, frenetismo puro y duro donde tendremos opción de uso de armas a melee, las cuales poseen un sistema de combos, o opciones de armas a distancia, las cuales varían según cuál elijas. La música es otro complemento a este frenetismo hermoso de gameplay, gráficos y oleadas de enemigos. La música de este juego es hermosa y complementa muy bien el universo de WH40K.
Aunque algo que no me gustó para nada es el comportamiento raro que tienen los bots aliados y el poco impacto que pueden llegar a tener en el gameplay. Otra cosa que no me gustó tanto es que la dificultad fácil y normal se sienten muy fáciles, mientras que la dificultad difícil se siente hermosa, y la última dificultad presenta todo un reto interesante. Recomiendo jugarlo en difícil, ya que es donde más sentí que se disfrutaba el juego. Otra cosa en la que flaquea este juego es en el escenario. Cosas como los barriles explosivos, objetos útiles como munición o medkits no resaltan mucho a la vista, así como también las cajas rompibles parecen un elemento no interactuable.

De igual manera, este juego se lleva mi votación de GOTY, aunque este Wukong o Astro Bot rondando como otros candidatos, mi fanatismo por el Emperador evita que me convierta en hereje. Sin duda, una sólida obra maestra que vale totalmente la pena para todos, tanto para quienes conocen de WH40K como para quienes no. Obra maestra totalmente recomendable, es una experiencia gratificante y vale totalmente su precio.",2024/9/6,es

I'm a Night,1,120.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/4611686018483226585/,"Итак, вы любите ультранасилие? Я да. А вселенную вархаммера? Я просто обожаю.
Но давайте я попробую сделать первый взгляд, немного абстрагировавшись от этого.
ПРЕДУПРЕЖДЕНИЕ: Букв будет много.
Для начала мой сетап и предустановки игры:
• Ryzen 5-2600
• RTX 3060ti
• 8 гб оперативной памяти
• Монитор 16:9, Эпик геймс предустановлен
• Выставленный игрой пресет графики «Высокое», под себя ничего кроме чувствительности мыши и кнопок не менял
• Уровень сложности - Высокий
А теперь к делу и по пунктам.
Оптимизация. Первые семь часов, полёт нормальный. Никаких проблем, вообще, ну вот совсем. Просадки кадров нет, стабильный fps в районе 50-60 кадров, изредка в особо больших сражениях ощущались проседания, но они пропадали так же быстро, как и появлялись. Что на моей системе при высоких настройках, а так можно было что ли?
Графика, так как это очень субъективный пункт буду краток. Это очень красиво и не режет глаз, чего я боялся, когда ждал игру.
Геймплей, старое доброе ультранасилие, что-то взяли из первой части, ввели модные добивания и БОЖЕ ИМПЕРАТОР КАК ЖЕ ЭТО ХОРОШО…. Кхм, простите, большой арсенал для умерщвления жуков, как на дальней, так и на ближней дистанции, оружие на мой вкус ощущается очень хорошо, не Destiny конечно, но достойно. Кровь кому-то может показаться мультяшной или вареньем, но меня это не смутило, моих боевых братьев тоже, в процессе напротив при погружении оно и не замечается вовсе. Игра достаточно хорошо соблюдает темп и вовремя чередует геймплей от нарезания фарша в лесу к неспешной прогулке по узким коридорам. На текущий момент всё что я видел не вызывает отторжения, а наоборот буквально вызывает сильное желание сыграть ещё.
Сюжет, а что сюжет, 7 час игры, рано ещё.
Немного о ПВП. Это неожиданно, здорово? Ну, то есть, вы скорее всего видели тизер пвп, там это выглядело немного неуклюже и аляповато что ли? Но когда ты сам туда заходишь, ууууу, подержите мои трусы, это динамично, интересно и (НА ДАННОМ ЭТАПЕ) выглядит сбалансированным (можно я просто промолчу о баласе лобби, это фикция, в остальном нормально). Штурмовики после первой части, конечно, стали менее мобильными, но это как по мне к лучшему.
Пока что как будто бы никаких минусов? Давайте это исправим и пробежимся по минусам, которые бросаются в глаза:
• Прогресс сюжета если вы играете с друзьями, остаётся только у хоста. То есть, если вы закончите игру и захотите продолжить, а игроком, на котором все собирались, были не вы, то извольте начать оттуда, где остановились. Этооооо, очень странно. Лично для себя я это не могу отнести к минусу, т.к. уже вижу, что пройду сюжет ни раз и не два, но для кого-то из вас это может оказаться критичным.
• Нестабильность сети и вылеты (опять же на данный момент). На данный момент вас может выкинуть в процессе игры из лобби. Если выбросит, то на автоматическое переподключение можете не рассчитывать и придётся вбивать код лобби, если человека нет у вас в друзьях. Но если вы как истинные боевые братья занесли друг друга в френд лист, то кнопка присоединиться к игре более чем работает.
• Управление, Да, для кого-то по первой это действительно может быть минусом, так что я настоятельно рекомендую при первом запуске подобрать кнопки под себя. Иначе ваше впечатление об игре может быть сильно испорчено.
Да в принципе то и всё по минусам на 7 час игры. Рекомендую ли я игру?
Для этого давайте разделим ответ на два.
Для вахафагов – ОДНОЗНАЧНО МАТЬ ЕГО ДА
Для всех остальных – Зависит от вашей любви к ультранасилию и визуальному стилю этой игры. Если вы из тех людей кто любит игры по типу Gears of war (без привязки к части), Doom, и Good of war именно за их боевую составляющую, то тоже да. Если нет, то я не уверен, что вам понравится. Есть ещё вариант поднять флаг, чтобы потрогать игру совсем плотно, но я вас очень прошу, если она вам понравится, покупайте. Такие проекты нынче выходят редко.
Ещё добавлю один момент, чтобы прочувствовать игру я бы рекомендовал первое прохождение:
a) В кооперативе с кем-то, так игра чувствуется совсем по другому, а в соло вы и так успеете сыграть.
b) Высокий уровень сложности. Так игра даёт вам вызов, с которым, я уверен, вы справитесь и это, будет более захватывающе.

Ну, вот и всё, много вышло для первого впечатления, не забывайте, что игра сейчас в раннем доступе для предзаказавших золотое издание и выше и могут быть проблемы которые, могут быть исправлены патчем первого дня. Буду ждать вас на боевой барже братья. После полного прохождения сюжета обновлю обзор.

И помните
- What's is your craft
- My craft is death

Update: ну так вот, спустя ещё 40+ часов игры сверху, в этот раз без многословия. Ребят, каждый раз как в первый, радуюсь как пиздюк которому погремушку дали, 11 из 10 по шкале великих. После сюжета тоже есть что поделать, но тут уже на ваши вкусы, для любителей визуального порно игра и по базовому ценнику уже на сюжете отобьётся.",2024/9/6,ru

Ceux qui se plaignent sont sans doute des démunies d'intelligence qui viennent des fameux Call of Duty ou autre fameux ""jeu de l'année"".
Un jeu ça se paramètre et AU NOM DE L'EMPEREUR, apprenez à le faire putain, le jeu est beau, jouissif, sans lag, c'est un GOTY large pour ma part.
Je joue actuellement avec un ami en Ange de la Mort et tout se passe super bien, c'est super bien équilibré et ont a pas de problèmes de lag ou crash ou je ne sais quel excuse à la con.
Focus à repousser la date de sortie, annulé leurs beta et j'en suis ravie. Voilà un jeu qui ne m'avais pas autant fait vibrer et plaisir depuis LONGTEMPS.
En bref, et je reviendrais PEUT-ETRE sur mon avis, ce jeu est un Empereur de l'Humanité/10.
Je vous laisse sur cela et je repars exterminer des Tyranids par centaines.
Bon jeu et POUR L'EMPEREUR !!!

Je reviens sur mon avis pour dire que j'ai fini la campagne en Ange de la Mort avec un ami et ceux uniquement avec UN SEUL bug qui fut contourner facilement. Ceci dit, à tout ceux qui chialent car ""gngngn c'est trop dur"" ""gngngn c'est bugué"" ou je ne sais quel connerie, achetez-vous du talent ou un ami et faite pas chier. De même pour les perf, apprenez à paramétrer votre jeu car j'ai eu UNE SEUL cinématique mal opti, rien d'autre.

Je rajoute, la campagne est un chef d'oeuvre bien plus poussé que bien nombre de jeu, je me suis émerveillé avec mon ami et même étant jeune scout dans le monde Warhammer, ce fut un régale visuel, auditif, psychologique et j'en passe durant une nuit (oui on a rush la campagne en 1 nuit chut). Dites-vous, ça faisait longtemps que j'avais pas vu des NPC se battre dans une campagne, c'était génial de pas se sentir seul héro de l'Imperium, on a eu des personnage même sans nom avec qui on s'est battu et on a adoré, ça rajoutais du volume sans que se soit sans âme, les NPC avait de la vie et ça c'est pas la plus part des guignol de studio d'aujourd'hui qui se ferais chier pour si peux. Aujourd'hui, peu de studios arrivent au niveau de ce mastodonte et c'est normal, la passion, le travail et les connaissances ont pris le dessus et l'argent est passé après, voilà pour moi des studios matures.

Je remercie vraiment Focus et Saber pour ce jeu, ils méritent mon argent et je regrette de pas avoir pris la Collector. La passion était de mise et même pour les inconnu du domaine c'est jouissif. Un immense bravo et merci à eux.
(non je ne lèche pas les boules car je sais qu'il existe les joueurs PS pour ça avec leurs """"""EXCLU"""""" donc je m'inquiète pas pour mon vocabulaire)
Ma note reste la même.
Merci pour tout.

Bon aller, je rajoute un paragraphe pour un peu d'humilité en disant quelques points négatif.
En premier, les Opérations ne sont pas faisable en privé entre pote sans qu'un pégu au micro tout droit sortie du cul d'un Necron rejoigne votre partie et se fasse défoncer. Vraiment, si c'est pour jouer avec des lâches qui chialent en difficulté 2/4 de la campagne, donnez-moi l'IA, elle est bien plus efficaces.
Ensuite, le mode en ligne forcé pour le mode Opération. Oui c'est un peu dérangeant quand on sait que ce mode de jeu est un bac à sable où les Tyranides sont moins violent que le Yorkshire de mamie en menace minime.
Après cela, et ça c'est pour les éditions Gold et Ultra. Nous n'avons pas accès directement aux armures inclu dans la Saison 1 car il faut les débloquer avec les fameux points de Réquisition...
Enfin, et celui-là est un poil plus personnel, on ne reçois aucune récompense en fonction de la difficulté dans laquelle on termine la campagne. Je demande pas un Terminator ou une armure de garde Sanguinien mais au moins une distinction, un titre, un logo je sais pas, juste de quoi se réjouir de nos efforts.
Voilà un peu d'humilité et de négatif pour prouver que oui je sais critiquer mais pas en chialant comme un jeune garde Imperial qui se fait soulever par des Eldar Noir.
Je remercie ceux qui votent positif et récompense mon avis, l'Empereur vous récompensera gracieusement, merci beaucoup. Aller, bon jeu à tous et n'oubliez pas : l'Empereur PROTÈGE !!!",2024/9/6,fr

PVPは触っていないのでなんともいえませんが、アクション好きならPVEモードだけでもかなりオススメです。

Perroford,1,51.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gosqo2/,"게임은 재밌음. 묵직한 타격감에 스페이스 마린이라는 중갑 거구를 잘 살림. 사운드도 그에 맞게 무겁고 어울리는 분위기를 형성함. 게임 시스템은 세키로가 생각나는 패링과 가드할수 없는 공격을 피하는 익숙한 시스템이 있는데 이게 또 재미의 한축을 담당함. 묵직하게 한방 한방 넣으면서 적을 썰어넘기고 짓밟는 재미가 있음. 연출도 좋아 기존 워해머를 좋아하던 사람이든 아니든 두 쪽 다 만족할만한 퀄리티를 제공함. 그래픽도 좋고 최적화도 잘됨.

하지만 7만원 돈 게임이라기엔 부족하게 느껴짐. 캠페인의 분량은 길지만 굉장히 반복적임. 그저 똑같이 별로 달라지지 않는 적들을 죽이고, 이동하고, 문을 열고 의 반복임. 보스전 조차 정예 적들의 강화판일 뿐이고 최종 보스를 제외하고는 전부다 다시 반복으로 나오는데다 필드 적인 이상 패턴도 몇개 안되 몇번 싸우다 보면 금방 반복적임. 적들 종류조차 적어서 지루하다고 까지 느껴지는 곳도 있음.

가장 최악은 원거리 적들인데 게임에 등장하는 원거리 적들은 전부다 화력도 강력한데 근거리 적들 만큼이나 체력도 많고 경직도 잘 안먹고 플레이어가 가진 대부분의 원거리 화기는 쓰레기 수준이라 호드 정리 말고는 안되고 중간급만 되도 경직도 안먹어서 원거리 적과 화력전을 하면 손해를 보는 상황까지 나옴. 추적성능도 좋아서 굴러도 두세발씩 흘려서 맞기 마련이라 결국 피해가 누적되기 마련임. 이중 가장 씨발소리가 나오는건 조안스로프 인데 한마리가 나올때마다 개발자 부모님 안부가 한번씩 궁금해지는 적임. 죽음의 천사 기준 체력도 탄창 2~3개 박아야 그로기에 들어가는데 공중에 떠 있어서 상대할때 다른 적들을 볼 수 없게 만들고 가불기 투사체를 연속으로 던져대는대다 심지어 주변 적들을 강화까지 해줌. 심지어 이 새끼들은 대부분 두마리씩 짝을 이뤄서 나오는데 이 둘이 엇박으로 투사체를 던지기 시작하면 피하기 바빠 딜할 시간조차 매우 적게 만듦. 극후반 플라즈마 인시너레이터나 라스 푸실을 얻을때까진 초근거리 무기인 멜타 라이플을 빼곤 제대로 경직도 없고 화력도 병신 수준이라 원거리 대처가 안되는 원거리 무기들로 인해 더 크게 다가옴. 체력 회복 수단도 극도로 적은데 원거리 비율도 적지가 않아 게임에 피로감이 쌓이는 주 원인이됨.

절대로 추천하지 않는건 이게임을 어려운 난이도로 하는것임. 게임의 완성도는 좋지가 않아 아무리 봐도 고난이도는 테스트를 안해보고 출시한걸로 밖에 안보일 정도로 무성의함. 위의 원거리 적이 매우 크게 다가오는데 총은 더 쓸모가 없고 후반으로 갈 수록 원거리 비율은 늘어남. 만약 적들이 서로 산개해서 총질해대면 지옥을 맛보게 되는데 아군 AI는 뇌사 수준이라 T로 핑을 찍어도 관심도 안주고 심지어 바로 옆에 적이 있어도 가만히 서서 아무것도 안하기도 하는데 적 AI는 대부분 나만 노리고 투사체도 나에게만 날림. 상기 했듯 체력 회복 수단도 적은데 그중 하나인 스킬은 차는 속도도 느리고 실드를 회복하려면 싱크킬을 하거나 오랫동안 안맞아야 하고 싱크킬이 타격감을 더해주긴 하나 너무 남발되면 게임의 흐름을 끊어먹는데 고난이도에선 살기 위해 싱크킬을 계속 해야하니 계속해서 게임 흐름을 끊어먹는 요인이 됨. 가면 갈수록 고난이도는 체크포인트를 억지로 미는 게임이 되 버리는데 체크포인트를 불러오면 체력, 스킬, 치명상을 다시 채워주는데 정작 체크포인트 도달시 치명상은 회복시켜주지 않기에 다음 체크포인트까지 밀지 못할거 같으면 그냥 죽고 자원을 채운뒤 다시 미는 존나 멍청한 양상이 되버림. 이 때문에 도전적이고 어려운 게임을 찾는 사람에겐 이 게임은 안맞음. 이 게임의 고난이도는 그저 불합리하고 지루함. 심지어 최고 난이도로 게임을 클리어한 것에 대한 특별한 보상이나 최소한의 도전과제조차 없는 게으름을 보여줘서 할 이유조차 없음.

즉 이게임은 매력적인 디자인과 시스템으로 큰 잠재력을 가지고 있지만 안타깝게도 에어소프트에 가까운 원거리 무기와 씨발 소리 나오는 원거리 적들, 매우 반복적인 게임플레이로 평작 수준임. 같이할 친구가 있으면 더 좋고. 워해머 프렌차이즈를 좋아하고 게임 자체 보다 워해머에 더 관심이 있다면 살만함.

황제 폐하께서 준비를 많이했네요.
게임 자체는 굉장히 재밌습니다.
캠페인의 경우 총 12시간 분량으로 나왔는데,
오함마 스토리를 애초에 전혀 모르는
사람임에도 불구하고 몰입도가 어마어마했고,
몹들을 한방에 때려잡는 그 재미는
제 탈모 초기 증세를 사라지게 만들정도로
시원했습니다.
근데 사실 캠페인보다 더 오랜 시간 즐길 수
있는 컨텐츠가 바로 작전 컨텐츠였는데,
이 게임속 작전 맵은 총 6개로 각각
난이도도 미미함,평균,어려움,무자비함
총 4단계로 구성되어있어 저는
이 컨텐츠만 거의 하루종일 하고있네요.
특히 이 작전 모드는 캠페인과는 달리,
맵들을 깨고 돌아올때마다 경험치 보상과
방금 사용한 무기 숙련도 경험치 보상
그리고 클래스 및 무기 특성트리를 찍을 수 있게
해주는 화폐 등을 보상으로 얻을 수 있기 때문에,
여기서부터는 성장의 재미도 느껴볼 수
있어줘서 저는 이때부터 더 빠졌습니다.
(나중에는 자주 사용하는 무기들을
더 높은 등급으로 업그레이드도 가능하고
또 각 무기내에 존재하는 특성트리도 찍을
수 있어서 개쎄질 수 있음)
(+ 전투맵을 돌때는 항상 주변에
상자들을 깨면서 돌아다니시길, 거기서
아머,치료제,총알 등 다나옴)

다만, 현재 평가가 싸버린게 좀 아쉬운데,
다행히 그 이유는 게임성 자체에대한 문제라기 보다는
아무런 소통도 언급도 없이
에픽온라인서비스(EOS) 프로그램이
강제로 실행되게 만들어둬서 그런데,
이 EOS가 대충 크로스플레이나 매치메이킹을
위해 사용되는 프로그램이라고는 하지만,
이게 오히려 성능 문제나 서버연결문제
그리고 게임 충돌 등 다양한 기술적
오류를 발생시킨다는 점에서 욕을
안먹을수가 없었다고는 보지만
결국 평가는 서서히 회복되리라 봅니다.
근데 저는 개인적으로 EOS문제도
문제지만 중간중간 세월아 네월아하는
로딩 스크린들이 좀 빨리 해결되었으면
좋겠네요~",2024/9/6,ko

Bu oyunun Helldiverstan farklı olarak düzgün bi hikaye modu var ve gayet yeterli bunun dışında pve nin yanında pvp nin de olması çok güzel olmuş. Tabi bunu oyunda ilerleyip daha çok zaman geçirdikten sonra deneyimleyeceğim bu yüzden pvp konusuna sonradan ayrı bi başlık açmam gerekecek. Oyunun grafikleri çok güzel optimizasyonu da bu grafiklere göre normal. Oynanış elementlerine gelecek olursak da karakter ağır zırhlı bir piyade ve bunu çok rahat hissediyorsunuz. Kanlı ve zorlu dövüşlerin ardından güzel bitiriş vuruşları da tuzu biberi oluyor oyunun. Oyundan başlangıç olarak yeterince memnun kaldım ama özet geçecek olursam:

ARTILARI :
Grafikleri
Dövüşlerin eğlenceli ve rafine oluşu
Hikayesinin herkese hitap etmesi
woke,sjw olmaması has erkek adam oyunu olması

EKSİLERİ :

Optimizasyon ortalama demiştim ama yer yer düşüyor

SONUÇ : Evet pahalı bi oyun ama bunun tek sorumlusu akp ve destekçileri yani akp liyseniz bu oyunun pahalı olması sizin suçunuz bu yüzden fiyata laf edemezsiniz. Normal vatandaşlara gelecek olursak da serinin çok hayranı değilseniz indirim bekleyebilirsiniz diğer firmalar gibi çoook uzun süre indirime sokmayacaklarını düşünmüyorum ama normal fiyattan da alsanız bi şekilde verdiğiniz paranın hakkını verecek bi oyun. 2-3 kez arkadaşlarınızla dışarı çıkmak yerine bu oyunu alıp 10 kez dışarıda geçireceğiniz zamanı bypass edip totalde karlı bile çıkabilirsiniz.",2024/9/6,tr
QuiLetoKyja,1,24.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Quilk/,"L’Empereur nous protège !

L‘Histoire : 3.5/4

La Planète Kadaku est sous la menace des Tyranides, des Xénos voraces sur le point d’assimiler tout le système.
La 2ieme Compagnie d’Ultramarines est dépêchée sur place pour tenter de stopper l’invasion …

L’histoire de Warhammer 40k : Space Marine 2 se déroule 100 ans après le premier volet, sorti il y a 13 ans. Il n’est pas indispensable d’avoir joué au premier pour suivre l’histoire même si c’est mieux (lire un résumé sur internet vous aidera). Pour le reste, les fans de W40k seront aux anges avec l’utilisation soignée du lore et des références de l’univers. Les profanes pourront peut-être se perdre un peu, mais prendront un grand plaisir à se plonger dedans s’ils ne sont pas rebutés par un univers dur et emplis de violence.


Ici, place à l’action, de bout en bout, un peu à la manière d’un Gear of War. La campagne principale n’est pas longue en soit. Mais elle vous emmène sur un rail d’action du début à la fin, entrecoupée de cinématiques vous transposant dans l’action et dans l’histoire.
Jouable au clavier/souris (vous allez rebind vos touches très probablement) ou à la manette (il est plus probable que le jeu ai été pensé pour ce périphérique dans ses contrôles), l’action vous embarque sur du tir à distance, du corps à corps, de l’esquive, de la parade, du contre, des exécutions/finish, etc… On s’emmêle parfois les pinceaux au début entre les esquives et les parades (signalées respectivement par un signal rouge et un signal bleu), ce qui ne pardonne pas dès la difficulté normale.

Toute la campagne est faisable en coop à trois joueurs, en revanche, et c’est clairement regrettable, celui qui lance la campagne progresse dans son histoire, mais ceux qui l’accompagnent ne progressent pas dans la leur et devront donc refaire les missions pour la faire progresser dans leur propre partie. Alors si l’on considère que la campagne ne dure qu’entre 10 et 15h, d’action pure et dure, ce n’est pas trop regrettable, mais c’est tout de même dommage qu’une progression conjointe n’ai pas été mise, surtout avec les reports qu’on lui connait.

Pour le reste, dans la mêlée, l’action est au rendez-vous. On regrettera peut-être un combat à distance un peu plus en retrait avec des armes dont les dégâts sont beaucoup trop faibles vis-à-vis de ce qu’ils pourraient être si l’on suit les règles Warhammer. Mais on ne boude néanmoins pas notre plaisir de lâcher quelques coups de Bolter Lourd ou de lance plasma, ou encore de Fuseur.
On pourra cataloguer ce titre comme étant un jeu couloir, mais le game design est tellement réussi que c’est un plaisir de le parcourir et de découvrir qu’au fond de notre champs de vision les hordes qui se dirige vers nous ne sont pas que des simples animations mais bien des Gaunts qui viendront au contact.

Enfin, outre la campagne, le jeu vous propose deux autres modes, le mode Pvp (Guerre Eternelle), dans lequel vous pouvez customizer votre personnage, ainsi que le mode Opération (PvE) dans lequel vous customizer distinctement un autre personnage pour réaliser des missions (6 actuellement) en coop à 3 (ou avec l’IA) pour en apprendre plus sur l’histoire de la campagne (missions annexes) et faire progresser votre personnage (système de progression des armes etc…). Des heures de bagarres contre les Hérétiques et les Xénos en perspective.



Ici, pas de Ray tracing. Saber a fait l’impasse sur les dernières technologies ou en tout cas les plus récentes. Il n’en demeure pas moins la présence du DLSS pour les possesseurs d’une carte Nvidia.
Par ailleurs, au-delà de ces choix, Saber a réussi un tour de force au niveau de l’ambiance et de la D.A. de son titre. Warhammer 40000 Space Marine 2 transpire l’univers de Games Workshop du début à la fin, et le visuel renforce la puissance de la narration du titre.
En outre, vous ne verrez aucune différence entre les cutscene et les phases de jeu. Un vrai plaisir.
Avec une RTX4080, un i5 13600k et 32 Go de Ram en 1440p, le jeu tourne en moyenne à 95 FPS sur écran 165hz tous les réglages en Ultra.


L’ambiance sonore est inégale. En cela que le son, de base, est vraiment très faible. Tout à 100%, les dialogues sont peu audibles, les musiques sont sourdes, de même que les bruits des armes. Il vous faudra surement jouer avec votre mélangeur de volume pour régler au mieux votre expérience sonore et profiter au mieux du titre.
Passé ce détail, l’ambiance est excellente même si on aurait aimé des musiques peut être plus épiques dans les phases cruciales.
Le son des armes quant à lui devient excellent et rend hommage à chacune d’entre elles.


Techniquement, le titre est très propre. Aucun ralentissement, aucun freeze, aucun plantage ou bug à déplorer.
La VF est super propre.
On soulèvera tout le moins deux détails : des temps de chargements trop réguliers et assez long, même sur SSD ; et un 95 Fps avec une config musclée ? Un peu gourmand non ?. Au-delà de ça, le jeu souffre de quelques soucis de matchmaking pour les opérations.
Cela étant, le lien avec l’Epic Games n’est pas obligatoire, et n’est nécessaire que pour les joueurs désireux de jouer avec les copains qui auraient le jeu sur la plateforme Epic Games. Sinon ce n’est pas nécessaire et cela peut être passé sans soucis.


Warhammer 40000 : Space Marine 2, s’il n’invente rien, offre une narration exemplaire et un plaisir total dans l’univers de Games Workshop du début à la fin. Le Mode Opération et le PvP sont là pour faire durer le plaisir. Avec une D.A. excellente, il saura ravir les fans autant que les profanes.",2024/9/9,fr

Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 - Review

Tuvo sus retrasos. Tuvo sus filtraciones. Tuvo todo en contra, pero finalmente está aquí. Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 es una realidad. Todo lo que cualquier seguidor del universo Warhammer podría esperar. Una explosión de testosterona. Frenético. Intenso. Sangriento. Salvaje. Ese servo armadura me recordó a Gears of War. Joder, como se lo extraña al Marcus y Dom. En Gameplay es un carrusel de alto voltaje con unas desmedidas cuotas de acción. Un festín de tiroteos para cualquier amante de los shooters. Gráficamente tiene planos fenomenales con una ingente cantidad de bichos, pero… comienza a hacer ruido cuando ponemos la lupa en sus rostros o el propio entorno. Lucen bastante genéricos. Quizás por eso el rendimiento es tan bueno. Tiene una optimización brillante. Tampoco necesita demasiado equipo para correr bien. Los niveles son más bien pasillos perpetuos. En fin, Space Marine 2 es una sobredosis de acción, tanta que dejara en coma tras unas horas. El hogar de cualquier fanático de los shooter y el terror de cualquier hemofílico.


*Bastante fiel al universo de Warhammer 40K.
*El regreso de Titus, todo un machote estoico.
*Los ejambres y las oleadas, dejan postales alucinantes.
*Un curiosa cruza entre Gears of War y DMC o GOW.
*Esa constante dosis de adrenalina en su Gameplay.
*Los modelados de la servo armadura son estupendos, pero…




*Los rostros no son de lo mejor.
*Los escenarios se me antojan algo lineales y se pierde ese sentido de verticalidad.
*Algun que otro pico de dificultad en solitario.
*Ciertos bugs o CTD como producto de la incompatibilidad con algunas versiones de MSI Afterburner.

先说优点吧
画质美工很出色,剧情演出还行,几乎没bug(至少个人游玩时没遇到),个人14代i7/4080s运行最高配置很流畅,全程百帧
然后说缺点吧
第一最要命的是网络不行,昨天九月六号时尤其明显,pve试着开了快十局只有三局进去了,其他都是卡在了""加载服务器""那一步,然后进去了的三局里有两局都非常卡体验很差,唯一不卡的那局呢是因为我是主机而且全程没有人加进来,pvp到是能进去但也卡的一批,其他人要么漂移要么瞬移根本打不了。这游戏将来以网络为主的,官方不好好管理网络问题是真要命的,玩家全都能给你跑完了(今天九月七号玩了几局网络还行,不知道是官方修了还是我关了跨平台联机的原因,网上说关了跨平台联机有改善,大家都可以试一试).然后就是难度和部分关卡(敌人)设计了。先说部分关卡设计了,玩过就知道那个守天线和守电梯锁链两处纯纯逆天,还有那喷火烧撕裂虫开路会遇到脑虫,然后战役里虫子的设计也不好打,个人感觉打虫子时很难受,后来打混沌时才好了些,玩起来才开始爽。然后无论战役还是pve行动电脑队友的智商都非常弱智,不会打高威胁敌人,会被杂兵引的乱跑,输出也低,唯一优点就是硬了。然后是这游戏难度不低,杂兵伤害不低,精英怪高伤控制强,少有不慎轻则破盾重则残血,然后回血还少,所以pve非常吃技术队友配合,有点差池马上坐牢。最后一点是操作和手感问题,近战手感怪怪的说实话感觉不如星际战士一代,然后是键鼠操作不改键位非常蛋疼,改了键操作也不是很顺手,网上说手柄操作舒服,过几天整个手柄试一试吧,毕竟没用过手柄玩所以不好谈这个

话在前头
本作是由欧洲两个巨头游戏公司牵头，由Embracer Group旗下的Saber Interactive工作室开发制作该作，即《僵尸世界大战 World War Z》的开发团队；由法国的浮世Focus Entertainment（原Focus Home Interactive）负责发行工作。
说到WWZ这款游戏，那自然而然就能联系到曾经他们工作室与Epic的深度合作。本次也一样，本作的联机方式依旧搭载着Epic服务器，因此在最初登录时，需要进行一次Epic平台验证。
但这个过程仅是验证，而非联动双平台启动，而且个人启动时也并未要求登录Epic账户（个人也无Epic账户），所以比起另一家法国公司的体验是要好不少的。
而这个验证服务似乎挡住了不少玩家，成为了一个游玩的痛点。
这里有这么一个方法，若是首次进入更新失败，则在任务管理器中杀掉一切带有Epic的进程，并验证游戏完整性，再开加速器对Epic平台进行加速，启动游戏再次等待更新。
更新服务进行验证这个过程，仅需一次，一劳永逸！
当序幕来到了更换掉黑色守望的披风盔甲，穿上这个标志性蓝色的极限的星际战士机甲之后，正篇开始了！

对于本作，我可用16字简评：简单难度，最高画质，流程运行，视听盛宴！

当一切射击动作游戏开始内卷关卡设计，解谜难题，潜行暗杀等流程来填充游戏内容的时候，一款经典又简洁的超猛男爽射游戏就这样横空出世了。
线性流程，讲究配合，一手爆矢，一手锯齿，一边射爆，一边锯肉。
虫潮堆叠，手雷包圆，大怪硬甲，翻滚格挡，枪决处决，回盾回能。
整整七小时的血肉横飞，血浆爆炸，肾上腺素始终运作，无脑上头！
无论是异星球环境、星际战士盔甲还是泰伦虫的模型，美工均上大分，可谓是最细腻刻画系列作品之一！
而游戏设计简单明了，超轻度的武器系统，几乎看不到的养成系统，学习成本低，操作连贯流畅，并将它区别于以“刷”为核心、强行拖延游玩时间的ARPG，是个纯粹的线性流程射击爽游！玩家需要做的，就是在对局外点技能，选职业，在对局中分配拾取武器。
如此，游戏的节奏把控更是需要精准到位，才能让玩家有着洗脑一般的共鸣，大声的喊出“为帝皇效忠”这句极为中二的话语。
而这就是在WWZ的研发经历中所获得的经验所致！同样的还有下面所讲述的游戏内容设计。
巧妙地削弱了场景中的资源补充，和可携带的弹药数量，使得游戏在潜移默化的主导玩家使用近战系统。
刀砍，可以快速清理堆叠着冲锋的小虫子；
刀砍，可以及时的捕捉到可处决的虫子，为自身回盾；
刀砍，可以更好的获得全屏血浆崩裂的爽玩体验。
若是手柄进行游玩，那将拥有更加细致的震动反馈体验！
但，同时也别忘了远程武器和投掷道具也是有用的攻击道具，因而还有枪决的触发效果。
仅仅是近和远两个攻击手段的设计，它就能够让游戏更偏向于多人向，设计出不同倾向的职业，来进行团队配合或PVP对抗。在游玩过程中，更合理的去分配资源。

“地狱潜兵”？“暗潮”？又或者“僵尸世界大战”？
或许都有，但绝非是缝合，而是经验的汲取！
这简洁的玩法、丝毫不为难玩家的关卡、敌人数量适中，关卡线性无档手的设计，以及更加有配合意义的多人合作玩法和更加细腻的视觉体验。每一项都是考虑着玩家要爽玩，要看着舒服来的。
在这个年代，你可以不玩地狱潜兵，你可以不玩暗潮，但只要你喜欢爽游或战锤40K，这不《战锤40K：星际战士2》就是最佳选择！",2024/9/10,zh-cn
Realtione etc.,1,25.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Realtione/,"Product received for free

Honestly, the first half of the campaign didn’t grab me as much as I expected. I initially thought it aimed to be a 40K [Space Marine] version of the other fellow Warhammer titles like Darktide and Vermintide but the Focus Entertainment version of them given the tricks it also borrowed from A Plague Tale and Aliens: Fireteam Elite. That would have been an overstatement for sure. Saber Interactive is turbulent as a developer but they did a solid job here.

While the Tyranid invasion dominates most of the game, and it ultimately means facing hive-mind swarms, the game flowed better once Chaos elements started to involve in the story. When you start sparring off against the Adeptus Mechanicus, the pacing improves. Although I dislike certain objectives in SM2, such as ""Hold off against the enemies until X is completed,"" they are acceptable for a standard TPS shooter campaign as long as the game flows well. And well, SM2 does flow. It features strong moment-to-moment gameplay, with frequent switches between melee and ranged combat, making it a good hybrid of hack-and-slash and shooter. The campaign also include a somewhat enjoyable final boss to end it all, intense action sequences, and varied elements like platforming and jetpack usage, reminiscent of the first game. There are even gameplay sequences involving a flamethrower against swarming rats. Sounded familiar? :)

The campaign (and by extension, PvE missions) has scarce supplies, especially in terms of aids. On higher difficulties, you need to use melee combat to fend off large groups of enemies [minoris] to conserve ammo, while also keeping an eye on Majoris enemies that provide armor upon execution. Executing these enemies requires parries and melee chains, which might remind you of Doom Eternal. Engaging in combat and switching tactics is often rewarding in SM2. My only small complaint is that there should have been a way to replenish health, similar to Doom Eternal. PvE is where the difficulty is to be more relied as you have only a few chances to be revived before you ultimately doomed to fail. In campaign even if you play one of the higher 2 difficulties you rarely worry about that and your companions are almost unbeatable because they are simply there to revive you and their health rarely goes low. From time to time I thought running a co-op campaign at the highest difficulty would have been much harder as my partner sucked more than the AI, lol. The scarcity in co-op becomes much more evident as the game would offer only 2 health packages at most although it would offer a cache to replenish ammo infinitely- again in a similar fashion to Aliens: Fireteam Elite.

PvE missions offer limited replayability unless you aim to master them on higher difficulties and grind for cosmetics. Which I really did not want to but it ends up being a personal thing. However, six PvE missions at launch isn’t too bad. Completing each mission adds another 3 to 6 hours of gameplay, which I appreciated. They had variety, though the environments and enemies are recycled. Some moments in these missions would have been great additions to the campaign (such as the Drake fight). I view PvE missions as an extension of the campaign, and with promises of more enemies and maps in the future, I hope PvE content will become more diverse and intriguing over time.

PvP was unplayable during my pre-release playthrough, and I haven't had enough time to explore it post-release. You use the same classes in both PvP and PvE, though you can customize them differently for each mode. The PvP is a 6v6 battle—far from perfect, but even with limited play, I found it to be a mode worth revisiting occasionally. Matches are quick, taking around 10 minutes, and the flow is smooth. SM2 currently lacks a battle pass or premium system for unlocking cosmetics, offering only free content and some season pass content throughout the year. So, there’s no fear of missing out. If SM2's PvP were a standalone mode, it might barely suffice, but as an addition to the main game, it feels fairly generous. It’s reminiscent of beloved 2010s multiplayer modes that came with a campaign, like TLOU’s Factions if you take a moment to recognize how beloved it was for a simple additional mp mode.

The visual fidelity and art design are standout features in this game. SM2 effectively captures the depth and the scale of Warhammer 40K universe with some of the most visually pleasing environments I’ve seen, despite being set in a war-torn setting. There are almost no janky parts, and everything executes well, including the execution animations. The bloodbath during intense combat is gratifying, and the sound design is excellent, with each weapon having a distinctive sound that enhances the experience of firing a bolt carbine to a multi-meta or swinging a thunder hammer.

The optimization isn’t the best, but I managed to get 40-50 FPS most of the time with a 3080 Ti/12700KF setup, playing on High presets with DLSS set to Balanced. I’ve seen worse, so I’ll take it.

本作代表了战锤40K世界观下改编游戏最棒的一代，无论是游戏画质还是动作设计，都非常亮眼。不仅拔高了战锤40K这一IP在玩家心中的地位，制作组还向玩家们再次展现了其游戏工业水准之高。

在本作中，玩家将扮演一名阿斯塔特（泰图斯），带领自己的小队，完成不同的任务职责，和自己的修士兄弟们狠狠的挫败来自泰伦虫族和奸奇的阴谋。剧情整体流畅，人物塑造相当出色。请注意，以下隐藏文字涉及剧透：总的来说，剧情非常出色，就是有点短，单人剧情时间约在6小时左右。

PVE合作模式可以看成是单人战役的延伸。在单人剧情中，背景通讯会告诉玩家，有别的阿斯塔特小队正在协助我们，而PVE合作模式正是协助玩家完成单人战役的那支小队。玩家可以从多种角度去体验同一任务背景下的战斗。这一点类似于《生化危机4》中的里昂线和艾达线，同一背景下发生的不同战斗，相辅相成，极大的加强了玩家的游戏代入感。但较为可惜的是，目前PVE合作模式存在一定BUG，例如难匹配、难进入对局等问题，且肝度较高，希望佩剑能在9月9日游戏正式上线前解决这一问题。

·极高的游戏工业水准
·花样繁多的动作设计
·优秀的剧情设计、人物塑造
·身临其境般的战场氛围塑造
·精彩的史诗级演出贯穿始终
·足具特色的双线程剧情体验

·单人剧情量不够大
·可选择的武器、装备较少
·PC端优化较差，对于低配置电脑不友好
·合作模式难以匹配、AI队友有待优化
·合作模式难度忽高忽低、经验计算方式不合理

游戏刚开服，存在许多影响游戏体验的问题，等一下，我成付费测试员了？？游戏时不时的卡死、无响应、永远加入不了的服务器，确实较为影响游戏体验，且本作对于电脑配置的要求颇高（非常吃显存），电脑稍微差一点，这B优化，直接完蛋。你这样，我怎么效忠帝皇呢？？？佩剑，说话！！！（byd，是不是没有安抚服务器机魂？）游戏毫不吝啬的使用了大量好看精美的CG，但你也不能直接把即时演算砍了吧？且较为遗憾的是，目前游戏中可使用的武器装备过少，一把动力剑从序章砍到结尾了属于是（开玩笑的，其实没这么夸张，但武器真的很少），但还是希望后续更新能弥补这些遗憾。还有一点就是动辄辗转40分钟的高强度战斗令我感到有些许劳累（回头人类改造计划带我一个。

国区249RMB的标准版定价，对于普通玩家来说，有那么一点点贵了。但考虑到极其流畅的战斗体验，以及无与伦比的战场氛围塑造，按6小时通关计算，一个小时约合41.5RMB，就当看了一场超绝电影，作为半个锤粉，个人认为还是值这个价的，毕竟本作代表了战锤40K旗下改编游戏的最高水准。
我一般不太喜欢对游戏给予购买建议，但这次例外。
如果你是战锤40K的忠实受众，那么不必多说。
但如果你看这游戏挺有意思的，但并不了解战锤40K的背景故事，那么推荐在B站搜索“达奇上校”，该UP的主页中有对于战锤40K非常详细的背景故事介绍。看完如果能get到点，那就买！反之，如果get不到，那么我建议不买或是打折再考虑。因为本作是改编游戏，所以如果了解一定的战锤40k背景故事，能极大的提高游玩体验。

能让玩家从头爽到尾的战锤40K改编游戏神作，虽有瑕疵，但仍瑕不掩瑜，后续的内容更新我个人暂持观望态度，希望佩剑不要学隔壁司马箭头，我花了钱，是来爽的。你一不给我看扔子，二不给我爽，你让我怎么心甘情愿的掏钱？希望后续更新的内容能如本作的单人战役一般，给玩家带来心旷神怡的虚浮体验。

While it doesn't run as well on my 4070ti as I'd like, this game kicks utter ass. It feels, genuinely, like a game from 2010. Both in good and bad. A singleplayer/co-op campaign, a PvE operation mode that has its own separate progression from it but ties into it narratively, and a pretty solid, no-frills-all-skill PvP classic arena-esque modes. A full package.

I almost forgot what it felt like to have a game release as a full package. Nowadays most games release with either the solo experience, completely a PvE coop one, or are PvP only. Most in the former camp have, at best, a small DLC of a mission or two to look forward to, and the latter is a microtransaction hellscape of every-other-month season passes. But here comes Space Marine 2, of a franchise I dismissed until recently, to give me it all. Visceral PvE combat against swarms of Tyranids both in campaign and the PvE operation mode (for a Halo nerd, seemingly very akin to Spartan Ops from 4) and the ability to shoot people's virtual, heretical avatars. And yet they promise more content to come, with a grand amount of customization to make your own little Imperium soldier spaceman.

I'm not going to say it's perfect. There's 6 PvE missions and as many, if not less, PvP maps and modes. But given the success so far and how good the final product is regardless, I'm going to put my faith we'll see that extra content. The season pass isn't a 10$ gate to a cosmetic progression system like everything else post-Overwatch, but rather the early 2010s version of a Season Pass. Which is to say, ""Give us 40 bucks and we'll give you the rest of our content later. Nebulous content we can't exactly assure you the quality of, but hey, it's coming regardless"". 10 years ago that version of a Season Pass was scummy, but maybe my will is eroded. I prefer that infinitely to 10 bucks for battle royale skins every 3 months. Like I said, it's a game that feels directly lifted from the early 2010's, and balance, especially in PvP, can feel a iffy (why can Bulwarks block my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bolt Sniper).

It makes up for it way more in what it offers though, and promises more to come in Marine Chapters and PvE/PvP content, a horde mode, et cetera. Easily a GOTY 2024 contender, and that's not just because it's been a light year. You'll swap from playing Gears of War third person shooting to Arkham countering and melee bashing on a dime, and cover yourself in excess gore as you do it. Easily recommended.",2024/9/10,en

Jest zrealizowana z oczekiwanym rozmachem i idealnie wpisuje się w ramy całego uniwersum. Krew, wykończenia czy odrywane członki to coś co definiuję wojnę w tym świecie. Mimo swojej liniowości i korytarzowej budowie oraz nastawieniem na to samo czyli ciągłą walkę ukończenie jej sprawiło mi wiele radości.



Świetnie ujęto i wykorzystano model walki wielkiego kolosa. Od samego początku inwazji Tyranidów widać kim gramy i kim sterujemy. Nasi elitarni bracia z legionu Ultramarine na tle zwykłych żołnierzy wyglądają jak prawdziwi tytani. Nie tylko wyróżnia ich zbroja co wielkość naszych postaci, prawdziwych gigantów równych Tyranidzkim wojownikom. Siła z jaką walczymy, poczucie broni ręcznej i strzeleckiej zostało oddane perfekcyjnie szczególnie jeśli gra się na dedykowanym padzie (ja używam XboXowego). Każdy cios, każdy postrzał czy headshot jest odczuwalni i daje nie małą satysfakcję. Krwawe wykończenia to przysłowiowa kropka nad i.



Pierwszy przemiłym zaskoczeniem jest dodanie kooperacji w grze. Poza pierwszą misją prologiem wprowadzającą następne misje możemy rozegrać wspólnie z jednym lub dwoma znajomymi. Działa to znakomicie i jeszcze bardziej podbija emocje z wspólnego grania. Na szczęście jeśli gramy sami AI naszych towarzyszy sprawdza się znakomicie.



To jest przysłowiowy deser. Jeśli ktoś pamięta poprzedniego Space Marine i zawarty w grze model multiplayera to do dzisiaj się lekko uśmiechnie. Był świetny i dostarczył mi wielu godzin świetnej rozrywki. Minęło 13 lat i dostaliśmy to na co wszyscy czekaliśmy. Dla samego MP warto kupić Space Marine 2. Jeśli jesteś fanem tego uniwersum lepszej gry do zabawy PvP w tym uniwersum po prostu NIE MA.

WeeHammy,1,36.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156021248/,"I have been wanting to play a sequel to Space Marine since the first game launched in 2011. To finally be able to play the sequel to it was fantastic! I love everything about Space Marines and the game in general so I bought the Ultra Edition of the game instantly so nothing would be spoiled for me via the internet.

Was the wait for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 worth it? Is it a good game? Is it a worthy successor to Space Marine (1)? Yes. Yes it was and I am glad I paid to play early because I loved and still am, currently loving everything about the game. Below I will explain why I am loving Space Marine 2 but first, a quick disclaimer!

This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on.

⚫In terms of optimisation - the game has no lag, stutter, fps drops, freezing e.t.c. Space Marine 2 is technically not out yet as of writing this review (paid to play early) and the game runs smoother than butter. Is this because Denuvo DRM is not on the game? Probably.
⚫The visuals/Graphic are beyond AMAZING and even on low specs, they look stunning.
⚫Fighting off the THOUSANDS of Tyranids that are coming to turn you into a bloody gore pit on the floor was PHENOMENAL. Watching them make the ""pyramid"" to climb up the walls and you punch, shoot, crush, stomp - OBLITERATE them from the face of the planet... the gore, the blood, the animations... all of which are so spot on.
⚫The game has a LORE-ACCURATE art direction which ANY 40k fan will respect and to top that off the lore is accurate and faithful to true canon lore. Compared to some ""recent"" 40k games - Space Marine 2 is the BEST Warhammer game to be released in over a decade.
⚫The combat system is stellar. Ranging from melee weapons to ranged weapons that work so fluently together in the heat of battle. Doing the melee combos to stun and then being able to point your gun - executioner style to kill them... felt so good.
⚫Enemy variety will keep you on your toes almost at all times. Not only are they ""unique"" they all have their own behaviours and abilities which will put your skills to the test of a true Space Marine.
⚫On harder difficulties the enemies seem to dynamically change their movesets (either this is true or I suck on veteran+) and, I am not kidding here, will TRULY test your skills. Harder difficulty campaign (or ops) will be a true test of player skill as you need to perfect your dodging and parrying ability because in the end - this show the true lethality of mankind's enemies in the 40k universe.
⚫The story was very well written and I enjoyed it from start to finish. It had interesting moments, moments where you would be like ""oh no"" or ""FOR THE OMNISIAH!!!"". Not only that, the characters were very well embedded in the story which only enhanced the story even more.
⚫Once you are finished with campaign missions you can play the OPERATIONS MODE (PVE) which run parallel to the base games campaign which has you playing as a different ultramarine squad that lets you level up weapons and several class's. Not only is this mode FANTASTIC, the progression feels rewarding as the longer you go, the harder it gets and more XP you will earn, ontop of that you will earn UNIQUE cosmetics that other players may or may not be able to obtain (as I said, skill based combat).
⚫If PVE mode is not your thing, don't fret! You also gain access to ENDLESS WAR (PVP) which pits Space Marines against the Chaos forces. It brings back the classic game modes such as Deathmatch which I am sure we all know how fun that was in Space Marine! Not only that, if you are struggling to get perks and weapons unlocked in PVP you can just go play PVE for a bit as PVP shares PVE's loadout customisation options.
⚫It has tonnes of content still yet to be released - look at the roadmap. Horde mode.... come on, who doesn't just want to sit and kill thousands, if not millions, of Tyranids for the Emperors name!

⚫The main issue that people are mentioning is the ""servers"" struggling at the moment - I have noticed this issue only seems to happen if you are playing COOP campaign or ONLINE modes - You can spend about 5-10 minutes on the ""loading"" screen to only realise that the game is not loading at all and this forces you to restart your game. If you are in Campaign, you will most likely loose all mission progress if you are the COOP partner or miss an important cutscene. This means you might have to replay the mission you had just played.
⚫You cannot order your AI team to do anything. Open a door. Press a button. Heal you. They are a bit ""stupid"" to say the least. Hey, no games perfect.
⚫There are no collectables or ""secrets"" to be found. Only Dataslates. I am mentioning this in cons because I feel like they missed a golden opportunity to add little secrets about ""past"" events or ""past"" games that have released.
⚫About the point above - there is no point in really exploring as there is nothing to see or find. Just the dataslates and even at that they are not really hidden at all. The maps were very linear full of dead-ends, wished there was a little more ""exploring"" to be had.

In the end, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is probably the best Warhammer game in a decade. Not only is it faithful to it's lore, it had practically no stutter, lag, fps drops at all, the animations are spot on, the characters are spot on, the world building and story writing were superb... this is what Warhammer should be like when you make it a game!!!

I wholeheartedly, after waiting almost 14/15 years for a new Space Marine game to come out... say this game should be played by everyone, new or old to the 40K universe.",2024/9/7,en

Wuffy,0,74.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013445641/,"As it stands now I can't recommend this game at this point. I paid for the gold version, so I'm 90 bucks deep into this game. I paid a premium for it.

On the technical side of things I don't have much to say. I've got a beast of a PC and it ran well. Never had a hickup. I did have many bugs however where my camera would bug out during a finisher or be thrown across the map while doing a finisher.

I had high hopes for this, being a massive 40K fan. Especially since I would get to play a Space Marine. Or so I thought. More on that later.

Campaign:
It is alright. Not much to say on it. It is so short it is barely worth mentioning. The story is cool, I think. You get to see a couple of different factions and a pretty big ending. The power scaling in the campaign makes you feel like a space marine. Barely.

I doubt that anyone who isn't into 40k would get as much as I did out of the campaign given teh lack of ""Oh I know that!"" moments which was around 40% of the fun. Can't fault them for the accuracy, it feels pretty authentic.

Haven't played it and I suspect that not many will.

Here is where the issues lie. Given that the campaign is over if you blink too fast you'll find yourself either playing operations or PVP. With these operations you have 6 missions. Bland, uninspired. Any misconception of you playing a space marine will vanish at this point. Basic ennemies (Minoris ennemies) will delete your health faster than a guardsman falling during a Krieg assault. You feel about as durable as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient. You deal about as much damage as a immunocompromised eldery cancer patient too. Oh and don't worry, you can increase your damage output from 1 to 1.2 if you reach level 25. So you can look forward to upgrading your damage to that of an overzealous toddler if you can manage to stick it out for that long.

Weapon variety is non-existent. You get maybe 4 weapons per class? A bit more if you play the tactical. Forget about playing any kind of melee class as well. You'll find yourself stunlocked. Yes, stun locked... in a horde shooter and slasher game. You missed that weird parry window? Well too bad you're dead now. Good you had that expensive Space Marine armor on right? Otherwise, you'd be dea-... oh right. Oh and don't forget that for many classes you don't even get a rifle or a melee weapon.

Sadly you are very sloooow in this game. Attacks take a financial quarter to complete only to provide diminishing returns. You have all the bad aspects of being heavily armored while not being tanky at all. Usually, games will make you slow and heavy in order to being able to take a lot of damage, and quick and nimble but able to take less damage. Not in this game. You'll take massive amounts of damage from a small critter of which there are around 30 around you at any given time aaaand be slow and deal no damage. Remember from the lore when they said ""Nothing that big should be that fast""? Yeah, must have been something the devs missed or something.

I feel like I do have to talk about this... I've seen a lot of ""skill issue"" comments brought to people who don't like the clunky combat and broken parry system. I have finished all from software games with the exception of sekiro and elden ring. So the choice is all follows: Either Space Marine 2 is harder than Bloodborne, Darksouls 1 to 3 and demon souls, or there might be something wrong with the gameplay.

I'd say buy this when it is on sale or maybe just buy another game. I hear good things about Black Myth Wukong. Strangely enough in Darktide you feel more powerful than in this game. Despite playing a prisoner under the orders of an inquisitor and not a superhuman angel of death.

This game had all my bias stacked in its favor, yet I still can’t recommend it. I played it for 20 hours, thinking that at some point the fun must start. Around any corner now. But it never came. I never felt like a space marine. And if I could refund it I would. But I’ve been punished for being optimistic. If you buy this game, expect nothing and then maybe it will surprise you by mistake.

I may revisit it if the devs rework many of the systems but we all know that it isn't going to happen;",2024/9/10,en

GedLouZe,1,22.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stereocraft/,"В обзоре в основном будут приведены впечатления от технического состояния игры, о сюжете и совсем чуть-чуть о мультиплеере
Шибко затягивать не буду, оценок ставить тоже, я же не проплаченный игрожур

Техническая составляющая игры
В общем и целом, для меня удовлетворительно. Стоит сделать оговорку, что вселенную Warhammer 40,000 я очень люблю и потому готов терпеть технические огрехи по принципу «чем бы разработчик не тешился, лишь бы бэк не трогал».
Поковырялся в настройках, что-то там накрутил навертел и вуаля, получил себе комфортные 60 кадров с просадками в особо масштабных сценах до 45, пойдет.
За время прохождения основного сюжета игры, а это, к слову, заняло у меня чуть менее 10 часов, я не встретил ни одного критичного бага, да даже условно забавных багов мною встречено не было. Хотя, понаблюдав за некоторыми стримерами забавные баги очень даже случались.
Опять же, делаем заметку о том, что это по сути «ранний доступ» для предзаказавших Gold-издание и выше, будем уповать на то, что к основному релизу разработчики техническую составляющую подтянут.
Боевая система ощущается странно, вроде бы волны врагов постоянно держат тебя на фокусе, стоит чуть отвлечься и тебя сразу же затопчут, а вроде как ты играешь за космоморяка, чувствуется его тяжесть и неповоротливость, хотя в книгах космодес мог в считанные секунды сделать такие вещи, что и представить себе страшно.

Тут все 50/50
С одной стороны, разработчики очень бережно отнеслись к бэку вселенной и каких-то поверхностных косяков я не заметил. Была пара моментов, где пришлось прибегать к помощи «пояснительной бригады» и проводить разбор того, что там пиксельные рты наговорили, ответы мы так или иначе нашли, но вот хотелось бы услышать мнения более опытных лороведов.
А вот с другой стороны нас встречает совершенно обычный, клишированный сюжет, который хоть и обладает каким никаким внезапным(!) поворотом, но все читаемо и предсказуемо, и даже скучно.
Возможного я слишком много перечитал книг по Warhammer 40,000 или перенасытился реального кайфа от того, как работает вселенная в Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, но в этой игре кроме пафоса Ультрамаринов, не ощущается буквально ничего, ни тебе воодушевления от их речей, ни тебе благоговейного страха от масштабности военной машины Империума; от окружения нет ни каких намеков на то, что ты играешь буквально за полу-бога, да немногочисленные солдаты Кадианского полка кланяются тебе (CADIA STANDS!!!), но не все, к сожалению, нет ощущения массового почитания Ангелов Смерти.
Отдельно отмечу, что, если Вы слабы по части бэка и основных каких то понятий вселенной, начало игры уже огорошит Вас вопросами, ответы на которые не столь тривиальны и придется покурить матчасть.
Операции позволяют взглянуть на события основного сюжета под другим ракурсом. Здесь мы оказывает поддержку основной группе лейтенанта Тита и по сути проходим игру параллельным путем.

Операции очень хорошо показывают те трудности, с которыми сталкиваются ""голоса из вокса"", которые так или иначе докладывали нам о продвижении своих заданий.

Но почему(!) почему(!!!) в Операциях есть прокачка, а в сюжетке нет!
Я уж молчу о том, что в Операциях и мультиплеере играются одни и те же классы, НО прокачка их ранга проходит по разному и опять же, прокачка, для ПВЕ миссий она медленная, я не думаю, что пройдя все операции 2-3 раза мы сможем прокачаться в потолок, а если и сможем, то сделаем это максимум для одного класса!
Ну ладно, немного я слукавил, некоторая косметика открывается или за прохождение миссий ПВЕ или победы в ПВП.

Я поиграл буквально час, из которых около двадцати минут боролся с «ошибками сервера», верю и надеюсь, что пофиксят.
Поиграть удалось две каточки, обе были в режиме аля «захват».
Мультиплеер играть еще более «тяжело» чем сюжет, «тяжело» в смысле здесь персонаж ощущается еще более медлительным и скованным.
За баланс классов не скажу не умею я в этом, что могу сказать с уверенностью, сейчас мультиплеер не станет Вам заменой каких-либо иных мультиплеерных шутеров, и существует лишь для того, что бы наконец-то поместиться с другими игроками в формате «космодес версус космодес»
Немногочисленные игроки довольно-таки приветливы и культурны, в чате в зависимости от стороны конфликта можно как увидеть фразы «FORTHEEMPRAHHH», так и «SKULLSFORTHESKULLGOD!!!1» и даже «WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHH!!!!»
Набегал в мультиплеере около 8 часов, общее впечатление - хорошо.

Играбельных карт, как и собственно режимов игры сейчас всего ТРИ.
Режимы игры представлены обычным дезматчем, захватом точек и удержанием точек.

Все это играется вполне себе комфортно, ощущение от ТТК приемлемое, в замесе пережить можно.
Играю пока только на одном классе (на ачивку), но прокачка класса очень долгая, хотелось бы побольше очков получать, за +/- среднюю игру с победой можно получить около 1,5-2,0 тысяч очков, а для прокачки сейчас нужно 16,5 тысяч. Понятное дело, победы будут доставаться не так часто и прокачка будет идти не быстро.
Прокачка классов дает доступ к новому оружию, элементам брони, косметике и гаджетам, прокачки перков вроде как нету в мультиплеере (что-то есть в операциях, но я туда еще не ходил).
Плюс насыпают внутриигровую валюту, за которую вся косметика и открывается. За игру можно получить от 10 до 30 валюты, анлок какого-либо элемента косметики стоит в среднем 30-40 валюты.

Если играть с друзьями то можно и какую никакую тактику придумать, с танком, саппортом и дамагером.

Обычный матч сводится зачастую к одному:
дезматч - ХОДИШ ТАЛПОЙ БОИЗАВ И ПУЛЯИШ ИЛИ СТУКАИШ ЮИДШЭК
захват точек - ХОДИШ ТАЛПОЙ БОИЗАВ И ПУЛЯИШ ИЛИ СТУКАИШ ЮИДШЭК НО ТИПЕР ПА ТОЧКАМ

Если ты готов к экспериментам и не пожалеешь о потраченных деньгах – ДА
В остальных случаях - НЕТ

Игра хорошая, годная, по Вархаммеру, УРА
Но даже мне, фанату вселенной, тяжело ее воспринимать как законченный продукт.
Ощущается сильная нехватка тактического взаимодействий в прохождении сюжета/ПВЕ миссий
Очень долгая прокачка, почему бы не предоставить анлок нового оружия за внутриигровую валюту?
Очень надеюсь на исправления производительности, в принципе играть и сейчас комфортно, но хотелось бы по больше стабильности фремрейта.
И еще куча мелочей, которые больше вкусовщина, чем толковая критика.

Я понимаю, что игра только вышла и впереди еще долгий путь, этим я выражаю надежду, что проект будет развиваться и займет достойное место в нише кооперативных игр.",2024/9/7,ru

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Review
Después de muchos años desde el lanzamiento de la acción original de los Marines Espaciales del mundo futurista de Warhammer, la secuela ha llegado. Te llena de adrenalina, pero también puede traer la frustración de morir a menudo. Afortunadamente, no tienes que estar solo para luchar contra las hordas enemigas, y en compañía de amigos, tus posibilidades de tener éxito y, sobre todo, de sobrevivir son mayores.

El personaje principal es el marine espacial Demetrian Titus, que era el personaje central de la primera parte y entonces todavía era capitán. Después de ser acusado injustamente de corrupción, es reasignado a la acción, pero después de ser degradado con el rango de teniente. Después del desembarco de entrenamiento al comienzo de la campaña, ya no lucha solo, sino en compañía de los marines Chairon y Gadriel. Al jugar solo, sus roles serán asumidos por bots, que pueden luchar decentemente y te revivirán cuando sea necesario, pero no puedes dirigir sus acciones y no esperes una cooperación más cercana. Afortunadamente, puedes reemplazarlos invitando a otros jugadores antes de ingresar a una nueva misión.

Directamente durante la campaña en la base, desde donde te transportan al área de la misión, puedes saltar y jugar operaciones PvE separadas o enfrentarte a otros jugadores en el modo PvP de Eternal War con los objetivos de capturar territorios, capturar con control y aniquilación. Sin embargo, dado que recibimos el juego antes del lanzamiento, fue prácticamente imposible encontrar oponentes vivos, pero al menos tuvimos suerte en las operaciones.

La ventaja de la campaña es la elección de la dificultad y el guardado automático del progreso en los puntos de control. Entonces, después de agotar las vidas o el número de resurrecciones cuando caigas, continuarás desde el último punto de control. Por el contrario, cada operación termina inmediatamente después de tu muerte (cuando progresas con compañeros de equipo en vivo después de la muerte de todo el equipo) y luego debes volver a pasar por todo de nuevo. Además, las operaciones son bastante difíciles y no llegarás muy lejos con los bots, aunque suelen revivirte.

Por otro lado, en las operaciones, puedes elegir la clase de tu personaje: hay seis de ellos para elegir, desde táctico, pasando por francotirador, hasta pesado. Incluso si fallas, ganas experiencia, niveles y nuevas ventajas por separado con cada enfoque utilizado. Aunque solo uno de ellos puede estar activo, pero definitivamente beneficioso en combate. Además, puedes cambiar de equipo en la armería de la base, donde desbloqueas nuevas armas, así como sus variaciones avanzadas. Además, puede personalizar la apariencia y las partes individuales de su cuerpo: casco, charreteras, placa pectoral, etc.

Lo interesante de las operaciones es que complementan la trama de la campaña, pero no es necesario pasar por ellas. Por ejemplo, sucede que Titus y su equipo deben cumplir el objetivo principal en el planeta, y al mismo tiempo otros tres marines deben llevar a cabo una acción de distracción de apoyo. El paso de Titus es necesario para la continuación de la campaña, pero puedes ignorar la acción de distracción o jugarlo en cualquier momento como parte de las operaciones.

En las misiones, progresas en diferentes entornos, tanto en interiores como en exteriores, pero siempre es una forma de corredor. Por lo tanto, solo puedes caminar por las calles demarcadas y no tienes la oportunidad de moverte libremente por la zona. Los objetivos son inicialmente bastante diversos, pero luego se repiten. Probablemente la más interesante es la protección de las cadenas de los ascensores o transmisores que intentan comerse a las criaturas voladoras. En el camino, recolectas municiones y equipo adicional, puedes cambiar de arma en los puestos. En lugares predeterminados, interactuará con los objetos seleccionados. Utiliza interruptores para activar mecanismos, abrir puertas o arrancar el ascensor, romper una barrera, etc.

Puede tener dos armas con usted, una de las cuales es un arma de mano más pequeña y, además de ellas, también un cuchillo, un martillo o una espada de energía. Al disparar, puede usar el zoom, donde la cámara cambia de la vista en tercera persona a la primera persona y puede enfocar el objetivo con mayor precisión, o incluso cambiar los modos de arma. En el combate a larga distancia, usarás diferentes rifles y metralletas con diferente alcance, precisión y cadencia. Sin embargo, la munición debe usarse con prudencia, porque es bastante limitada y los suministros no siempre están a mano.

En los ataques cuerpo a cuerpo, literalmente cortarás todo y usarás ataques de área más fuertes, que son un placer para diezmar a los tiránidos. Finalmente, cuando la víctima está temporalmente inmovilizada y se ilumina en rojo, para poder ejecutarlos. Las ejecuciones no solo son impresionantes a la vista, sino que también complementan instantáneamente algunas de tus armaduras. Se agota cuando se daña, y luego los enemigos te quitan la salud. Esto se puede restaurar parcialmente, pero usará estimulantes para una recuperación rápida. Otro accesorio útil son las granadas.

Space Marine tiene gráficos decentes con soporte DLSS y efectos y componentes estándar. La apariencia es agradable, principalmente debido al gran diseño de los sitios con atención al detalle. Se trata de hermosas vistas, por ejemplo, de una base militar, donde, además de tu equipo, también puedes ver a otros secuaces y unidades del emperador disparando a hordas de tiránidos que se ciernen a lo lejos. Y cuando saltas a la acción y eres asistido por un tanque, la atmósfera y la experiencia de combate son muy intensas. Sin mencionar que los fanáticos acérrimos del universo de Warhammer 40K también deben estar muy impresionados por los elementos auténticos, el procesamiento de armaduras, unidades y estructuras.

Space Marine 2, para un fan de Warhammer 40,000, es un sueño hecho realidad. Aunque no hace falta ser un ávido fan o haber jugado al capítulo anterior para apreciar el juego, lo cierto es que se ha hecho con el debido cuidado pensando en las personas que aman la franquicia y les habla con referencias muy específicas y con algunas sorpresas. Con Space Marine 2 puedes esperar una acción de pasillo sencilla con hectolitros de sangre, ubicaciones bien diseñadas del universo de Warhammer 40,000 y mucha diversión en compañía de otros jugadores. Al jugar en solitario, puedes disfrutar de unas 10-12 horas de campaña con una historia, pero el resto es casi injugable sin compañeros en vivo, aunque se pueden usar bots. Las operaciones cooperativas con amigos son excelentes, adrenalina, sin ellos aburrimiento y muerte rápida. Y PvP es para medir las fortalezas y habilidades de los demás. Por lo tanto, Space Marines 2 sobresale en el avance en modo cooperativo y la campaña tampoco se puede desperdiciar y no tienes que haber crecido en Warhammer para disfrutarlo..",2024/9/6,es
Ysusai,1,28.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ysusai/,"«Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2» или «Тит не предавал!»

С серией «Warhammer 40,000», я долгое время был незнаком, часто о ней слышал, она всегда была где-то на фоне, но проходила мимо меня. В какой-то момент, меня заинтересовал покрас миниатюр, и пришло время наверстать упущенное, и погрузиться в «мир далёкого будущего, где есть только война!». Я начал читать, смотреть, играть в игры «вселенной», и меня затянуло в «Варп». При этом называть себя тру фанатом, всё же язык не повернётся, я, скорее любитель сеттинга, и с этой позиции постараюсь поделиться своим мнением по данной игре.

Стоит отме«Тит»ь, первая часть, вышедшая в 2011 году, была пройдена мной несколько дней назад, впервые, соответственно имея свежие впечатления, незамутнённые 100-летней службой в «Карауле смерти», и ностальгией, мне будет, с чем сравнить.

«Ортодоксия»:

• Графика: я понимаю, что в наше время практически все крупные проекты, обладают красивым визуалом, но «Святая Терра», какая тут проделана работа: с окружением и детализацией, текстурами и освещением, с какой любовью и уважением. «Император одобряет!».

• Атмосфера: постепенно продвигаясь по сюжету, всё дальше в глубины «Хаоса», градус накала растёт, словно «примарис», в процессе «генетической аугментации», а твоя челюсть, моментами просто отваливается, как у поверженных «тиранидов», добиванием «цепного меча». Масштаб и эпичность сцен, будто сошедших с картин, поражают воображение, и, наверное, нигде я не видел такого количества объектов в кадре, движущихся словно лавина. Необычное чувство причастности, в этом великом крестовом походе, всего «Человечества!».

• Музыка: буквально с первых секунд появления экрана меню, первое, что ты слышишь, это густой и обволакивающий, яростный и величественный, саундтрек главного меню игры, тебя сразу сковывает, будто цепями, и ты сидишь, затаив дыхание, в ожидании эпической истории, невероятных сражений, настоящего испытания твоей выдержи, и прочности братства «Ультрамара!».

• Геймплей: боевая система, построена на стрельбе, и ближнем бое, с сочными добиваниями врагов. В арсенале имеются «болтеры» разных видов, ножи, мечи и молоты, а так же несколько типов гранат и тяжёлое оружие. Стрельба приятная, пушки разнообразны и по-своему хороши, в определенных ситуациях. В ближнем бою, в нашем распоряжении, слабые и сильные атаки, уникальная способность, блок и парирование. Битвы с боссами, и крупными врагами, позволяют на полную раскрыть все возможности этой системы. Поначалу сложно попадать в тайминги, но постепенно привыкаешь, и, почувствовав вкус крови, начинаешь получать нереальное удовольствие. Хотелось бы, посоветовать, тем, кто будет играть на геймпаде, обязательно берите «DualSence», не пожалеете, сразу добавляет один балл к погружению, каждый шаг, каждый выстрел, отдает вибрацией, а адаптивные триггеры, заставляют пальцы напрягаться и дрожать, трястись и уставать, будто ты сам жмёшь на спусковой крючок, облаченный в «силовой доспех». И самое главное, что даёт тебе игра, это невероятное чувство сплоченности, когда приходится выживать на поле боя, стоя спиной к спине, и рассчитывать лишь на рефлексы и верный «болтер» в руках.

• Сюжет: продолжает события первой части, с интригой, эмоциональными качелями и неожиданными поворотами. Диалоги в свою очередь, помогают раскрыть характеры персонажей, а следить за изменением их взаимоотношений, в течение всей истории, довольно интересно. При каждом возвращении на «Боевую баржу», братья по оружию, дают новые крупицы информации о мире, и происходящих в нём событиях. В целом мне понравилось, возможно, фанаты, увидят там больше контекста, и отсылок к любимой франшизе, но лично для меня, как для любителя, присутствует легкая недосказанность, и многие вопросы, так и остались без ответа. Но меня радует, то, что есть задел на будущее, и у тебя как у игрока, возникает желание, ещё больше погрузиться во вселенную «Warhammer 40,000».

• Совместная игра и другие режимы: в коопе игра начинает играть новыми красками, и дарит незабываемые впечатления. Также есть PvE «Режим операций», где, к примеру, можно создать собственного «космодесантника», с уникальной персонализацией, и пройти задания отрядов, участвовавших в событиях основной компании, но действующих параллельно отряду «Тита», или сражаться в режиме «Вечной войны» в PvP.

• Озвучка: во-первых, она есть, во-вторых, мне понравилась намного больше оригинала.

«Ересь»:

• Геймдизайн: игра далеко ушла во всех аспектах от предшественницы, кроме геймдизайна, на мой взгляд, в 2024 году, он смотрится немного устаревшим, у меня было ощущение, что я вернулся во времена, «Xbox 360» и «PlayStation 3», и поймите меня правильно, это неплохо, в какой-то мере, даже хорошо, учитывая засилье игр с открытым миром. Но возможно, мне хотелось бы чего-то более изобретательного, чего-то большего, чем однотипная структура миссий: достичь, продержаться, защитить.

• Геймплей: с одной стороны он прекрасен, но есть и оборотная сторона. На максимальном уровне сложности «Ангел Смерти», медлительность и топорность боёвки, начинает беспокоить, и нажатые вроде как в тайминг парирования, просто не срабатывают, время отклика оставляет желать лучшего. По итогу, в крупных замесах с сильными врагами, ты пропускаешь удары, которые стоят тебе жизни. И вы будете правы, если скажете, что-то вроде: «ты просто не умеешь играть» или «попробуй понизить сложность», но зачастую именно на высоком уровне сложности, боевая система раскрывается в полной мере, и тот факт, что она не работает так, как ты от неё ожидаешь, способствует возникновению вопроса: «а тестировалось ли это вообще?».

• Оптимизация и баги: игра на высоких настройках, с моей «RTX 3070», и в 2к разрешении, чувствовала себя неплохо, но в моменты «тяжелых» сцен, случались просадки кадровой частоты до 20-30 FPS, что превращало игру в слайдшоу, а про попытки сделать парирование, я вообще молчу. В одной из миссий, на лифте, произошел баг, когда я не мог взять ни аптечку, ни гранаты, и, учитывая ограниченное количество ресурсов, опять же, на уровне сложности «Ангел Смерти», дальнейшее прохождение игры, не представлялось возможным.

В целом игра очень крутая, лично у меня, возможно по незнанию лора, остались вопросы к сюжету и повествованию. Происходящее, показалось мне несколько скомканным и рваным, мечущимся от одной темы к другой, и не до конца их раскрывающим. Где-то не хватило объема информации, а очень бы хотелось. Но, так или иначе, эта одна из лучших игр этого года, красивая, эпичная, масштабная, с отличным саундтреком и разрывным геймплеем, игра, в которую хочется возвращаться, рвать и кромсать «ксеносов», «За Императора»!

А разработчикам, которые оказались нашими ребятами, и сделали достойную игру по вселенной «Warhammer 40,000», хочется пожелать не останавливаться на достигнутом, и никогда не сдаваться!

СЮЖЕТ/немного о геймплее

Всё развивается спустя 100 лет, после окончания сюжета оригинальной Space Marine. Осуждённый капитан Тит отбыл свой срок в карауле смерти и в ходе выполнения задания был сильно ранен, но прибывшие марины спасли его. Очнувшись, Тит говорит, что хотел бы вернуться в караул у смерти. Каппелан же настаивает, что его связь с хаосом оспорена и он должен снова надеть броню примариса. После идёт знакомство с новым отрядом, высадка на планету и эпичные битвы.

Сюжетная компания мне понравилась. Эпика в сравнении с оригиналом навалили мега много, как в локациях, так и в происходящем. Можно пройти всё играя в команде из трёх человек, чего не было в первой части. Локации в большинстве своём это почти прямые коридоры до конца уровня. Сражаться предстоит с тиранидами и хаосом. Битвы с боссами сделаны очень активными, но стрелковый урон по ним низкий, а в качестве основного оружия обязательно будет лишь болтер, что печалит. Доступные 4 уровня сложности. Общее количество оружия увеличили до достаточно обширного количества.


Графон, прям чувствуется во всём от того, как греется ваша система, при высоко-средних настройках с пресетом DLSS на скорость до графического гигантизма. 3080 держит в большинстве случаев стабильные 60 кадров с очень редкими просадками, но когда начинается режим волны врагов, просто готовьтесь к стабильному снижению на 20 кадров.

Ролики у игры выглядят эпично круто. Я бы сказал, что Saber могли и фильм спокойно слепить.

Кровищи тоже в игре достаточно, а добивания выглядят сочно и кроваво.


Вам на выбор всегда будут предложены 6 классов со своими наборами оружий и уникальными умениями. Для открытия новых скинов нужно фармить валюту за которые по открываются новые облики и осуществляется прокачка в ПВЕ.

Один режим в котором представлены 6 миссий. Выбирайте всё также из доступных классов и втроём выполняете указанную цель. Одинаковые классы выбирать запрещено. Четыре уровня сложности, где вам рекомендую заходить на определённом уровне персонажа. Если вы прошли компанию на уровне сложности Ангел Смерти, то можно сразу начинать со второй.

Карта каждый раз одинаковая, но генерируются случайные набеги врагов, переставляются сундуки с патронами и в некоторых местах стоят другие враги. В случайных местах можно найти серво череп или геносемя. Череп принесёт доп ресурсы, а семя подарит опыт, но если вас не убьют. После первого падения союзники могут вас поднять, после чего происходит воскрешение спустя 60 сек. Реиграбельность есть, но она прям минимальная. В коопе конечно весело, а при отсутствии союзников выдадут ботов, что любят втыкать в каждый файт.

Фармить здесь придётся много. Опыт идёт в каждого персонажа отдельно и оружие будет общим для некоторых классов.

У персонажа открываются новые умения облегчающее дальнейшие попытки прохождения и более высокий уровень сложности. Будут командные и личные навыки. Вроде 8 категорий, где в каждой представлен выбор из 3-х доступных умений, но все удастся открыть лишь к 25 уровню.

Для оружия всё прям куда более запарно. У вас есть опыт гира и опыт оружия. Выше уровень гира = более мощные пушки будут доступны. Но прежде чем открыть новый уровень нужно его открыть, а потом накопить указанное количество опыта. Есть различные модификации оружия. Скажем + урон или увеличенная обойма, если совсем по-простому. И вот прокачав такую модификацию вам дадут одно очко для улучшения оружия. Бонусы там местами забавно распределены. Если вам лень качать опыт или не нравится бонусы оружия, то просто потратьте спец ресурс получаемый за прохождение миссии.

Что мне не нравится в прокачке пве.




Всего 3 режима, которые на мою скудную память были ещё в оригинальной SpaceMarine. Играя в любой из доступных режимов вы получаете опыт и ресурсы. Уровни общие для открытия оружия, а также есть отдельные для каждого класса. Карты достаточно маленькие и бои идут почти постоянно. В среднем матч длится 10 минут. Из 6 доступных классов можно пикнуть только 2 одинаковых.







Отмечу особенности данных сражений и спорные моменты.












Покупал себе супер премиум отсос эдишн за 5200р. Зачем? А вот просто захотелось. Провёл в игре 22,5ч из которых 7-8ч было потрачено в коопе на прохождение сюжетной компании на сложности Ангел Смерти, 1,5ч наверное на пвп и остальное на пве. Если вас интересует только сюжетная кампания, то рекомендую поднять знакомый флаг и насладиться лишь ей, но в одиночном режиме. В коопе конечно веселее.

ПВЕ в общем мне понравился, но реиграбельность в общем слабая и постоянно перепроходить никто не будет. Мне кажется большинство людей сыграли по 1-2 раза на каждой карте и забили.

ПВП баланс местами кажется странным, карт мало и пинг на некоторых серверах доходит до 300. Судя по достижениям мало кто отыграл 10 раз в один из режимов.

Ещё игра доставит вам Epic Online Wrvice для кроссплея. Saber отлично прогрели твич дропами на скины в особенности за платную подписку и конечно за подписку на warhammer+ вам дадут болт(Р)! И конечно мне понравился ранний платный бета тест. Выдаю себе значок “Я не ЛОХ”!",2024/9/10,ru

Это чистой воды ересь, я даже не понимаю наношу ли я ему урон. Если вы делаете игру которая вроде как должна поощрять агрессивный стиль боя, так дайте возможность игроку это реализовать, защищаться от толпы врагов вообще не понятно как, пушки на самом высоком вообще урона не наносят.

Я вахоеб и вы меня расстроили, допройду кампанию и может изменю обзор. Кампания конечно топ, один момент когда Тит держит знамя чего стоит. Но ПвП режим - полный кал, по сравнения с 1 частью и eternal crusade, карты маленькие, баланс кривой, не знаю, что им надо сделать, чтобы его пофиксить.

Omnissiah Corp,1,73.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OmnissiahCorp/,"Žádné další woke games, tohle je hraní pro tvrdé chlapy. Hrozný nářež, od první mise swarmy nepřátel všude kam oko pohlédne. Graficky skvělé, na lepším PC až fantastické a bojový systém a ovládání je o zvyku. Veterání z předchozího dílu, ale i takových Gears of War dobře znají. Náboje věčně nejsou a když jo, dojdou rychlostí blesku. Tohle je prostě kruté a nemilosrdné melee !! Co mne opravdu nadchlo již u první mise je výpravnost, ten pohled do dálky na bitevní pole poseté stovkami Tyranid bestií, na zemi i na nebi, to bude nejen pro hardcore fans Warhammer 40k asi to největší wow. Kampaň má přibližně 12 hodin hrací doby, příběh solidně graduje a rozhodně jsem se skvěle bavil. Jedná se o lineární postup každou z misí, kdy hra občas přehodí hráči zbraně dle postupu a obecně ho moc za ruku nevodí. Opět, chce si to trošku zvyknout a akceptovat záměr vývojářů, aby jste si v pozdější části kampaně užili naprosto top cut scény, z toho doslova stříká testosteron. Bossové jsou zábavní se solidní obtížností, i na normal to může pro některé hráče být docela morda dokončit.

Další z nabídky herních modů je PvE mise a PvP, oba zábavné. PvE Solo Operations umí být až neskutečně těžké, ale odemykání různých class mariňáků a zbraní s perky je solidní zábava na další hodiny.

Optimalizace hry je velmi dobrá, žádné záseky, crashe ani dropy FPS jsem vůbec nezaznamenal. Pro rychlé načítání to chce ale solidní SSD, rozhodně by jsi ho měl mít. Takže nic, co by mě u pre-orderu nepříjemně překvapilo, naopak chválím stav hry ihned po vydání. Obočí mi nadzvedlo snad jen to, že podporu širokoúhlých monitorů přinese až jedna z pozdějších záplat? Proooč?

Někoho taky třeba zarazí, že hra po spuštění zahájí bez dotazů instalaci Epic online služeb - mě osobně to je naprosto ♥♥♥ - jen zmiňuji. Nejedná se o propojení Epic a Steam účtu, to se může a nemusí provést přímo v herním menu. Jde tedy vyloženě o cross-play funkci, tzn. aby vás hra dokázala připojit na vzdálené servery. Bohužel to tady x-recenzentů asi nepochopilo a psalo hejt, jako pardon - tohle je absurdní. Váš kompl není trezor a ty internety nejsou anonymní.

[R.m.K] Gandi,1,54.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/asteg232/,"Als Fan des Warhammer 40K-Universums war ich von Space Marine 2 sofort gefesselt. Das Spiel bringt all das mit, was ich an diesem düsteren und brutalen Universum liebe: großartige Grafik, flüssige Performance und eine packende Atmosphäre, die mich voll in die Schlachten des 41. Jahrtausends eintauchen lässt.

Grafik – Eine beeindruckende Reise ins Chaos

Die Grafik ist schlichtweg atemberaubend. Von den detaillierten Rüstungen der Space Marines bis zu den schier endlosen Horden der Tyraniden – jedes Modell ist ein visuelles Highlight. Die Umgebungen sind düster und episch zugleich, genau wie man es von Warhammer 40K erwartet. Besonders beeindruckend fand ich, wie die Explosionen und Kämpfe visuell eingefangen wurden. Jeder Treffer hat Wucht, jede Explosion lässt den Bildschirm erzittern, und die Schlachtfelder verwandeln sich schnell in Ruinen. Es ist, als würde man mitten in einer Schlacht stehen.

Performance – Flüssig, auch wenn es hektisch wird

Selbst bei den größten Schlachten bleibt die Performance stabil. Ich hatte keine Einbrüche in der Bildrate, auch wenn Dutzende von Tyraniden auf dem Bildschirm wüteten. Das Spiel läuft bemerkenswert flüssig und zeigt, wie gut optimiert es ist. Besonders beeindruckend ist, wie es selbst auf mittleren Systemen stabil läuft, ohne an visueller Qualität zu verlieren.

Spielgefühl – Intensiv und brachial

Was mir besonders gefallen hat, ist das Gefühl, tatsächlich ein Space Marine zu sein. Space Marine 2 schafft es, die Wucht und Stärke eines Ultramarines perfekt zu vermitteln. Jede Nahkampfatacke fühlt sich wuchtig an, und die Bolter-Schüsse haben einen befriedigenden Klang. Man hat das Gefühl, unaufhaltsam durch die Feinde zu pflügen – und genau so soll es sein! Die Steuerung ist dabei intuitiv und flüssig, sodass es Spaß macht, durch die gegnerischen Horden zu wüten.

Atmosphäre – Das 41. Jahrtausend zum Leben erweckt

Space Marine 2 fängt die düstere Atmosphäre des Warhammer 40K-Universums perfekt ein. Die Brutalität, die Hoffnungslosigkeit und die ständige Bedrohung durch die Tyraniden sind in jedem Moment spürbar. Der Soundtrack und die Geräuscheffekte tragen zur Immersion bei – von donnernden Explosionen bis zum furchteinflößenden Brüllen der Feinde. Man fühlt sich wirklich, als kämpfe man um das Überleben der Menschheit.

Fazit – Ein Muss für 40K-Fans

Space Marine 2 ist ein intensives, visuell beeindruckendes Erlebnis. Es fängt die Atmosphäre des Warhammer 40K-Universums perfekt ein und bietet eine flüssige, kraftvolle Spielerfahrung. Für Fans von Warhammer 40K ist dieses Spiel ein Muss!",2024/9/6,de

可以说是不折不扣的粉丝向游戏，如果没接触过战锤的玩家还是慎买吧。
---------------------------------------
剧情方面依旧是简单的砍翻所有敌人的设计
在敌人种类方面：
目前敌人的种类肉眼可见的还是在8版至九版设计的，如果你想看到会动的诺恩那就可能得等更新了。
泰伦方面有刀虫、枪虫，武士、枪武士，脑虫、蛇虫、大脑虫，刽子手、利卡特、撕裂虫、石像鬼、孢子和暴君
千子方面有红字战士、巫师、教徒、叛变星界军、尖角兽、圣甲虫终结者。
但是在正常游玩中，玩家能面对的虫子单位会缺少暴君，几乎在整个流程中见到的都是刀虫、枪虫、武士、枪武士
石像鬼仅在少数关卡会遇到
而暴君并不在正常游戏里面，他放到多人PVE里了
这游戏的虫子射击很离谱，如果你玩过黑神话的话，里面耗子也就图一乐，这枪虫真的会给你打破防。
在关卡设计方面：
个人认为教学观设计得很屎，难度偏高且长······
如果你想联机和朋友打怪，建议是你先自己通一遍再联PVE任务，不然你是没法直接解锁PVE任务的。
关卡设计不算很巧妙，流畅度也有缺失（相比一代），整个地图的设计就一条线，然后走到尽头，开开关，继续走，再开开关，这些设计明显是能自动完成 ，不知道为什么得故意这样设计。
演出方面
演出就很锤了，能看见会动的奇美拉，会动的黎曼鲁斯，会动的虫子，还有处决。

#NAME?,1,466.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056606996/,"The game is Warhammer 40K through and through. Grim, Dark and gritty.

The story is good and introduces you to why Titus got turned into a Primaris well.
For the obvious culture war question: No, it is not ""woke"".

Combat is violent and satisfying. A similar experience to what I recently had with Batman Arkham Knight. It is challenging.
(Countering, dodging and learning patterns etc, but it is more simplified here).
When you play as Titus you FEEL like a Space Marine. The power of the melee attacks, ripping enemies limb from limb. The shaking footsteps where you can 'feel' the weight behind every step. The thunderous boom as so much armour, meat, bone and muscle hits the ground after jumping down a ledge.

Started the game on hardest difficulty, and it is very challenging. Still determining if it will be possible to finish playing solo with bots. Edit: Seems possible, but is very challenging. Would only suggest ""Angel of death"" difficulty for the most dedicated players.

Shooting is also satisfying, but can't be completely relied on, engaging in melee is nearly mandatory once swarms close in.

Visuals are very impressive and faithfully 40K.

Sounds are all great and when involved in fighting give you the feeling you are in a battle.
Music is dark and 100% fits 40K theme. The main theme when the game starts actually sent chills down my back. (Awe inspiring).

After a quick look, operations and Endless War mode will provide plenty of replay opportunity.
Edit: Operations is thoroughly enjoyable. Levelling up is fun and very satisfying to become more powerful with more perks, better weapons and the armour skins are beautiful. The artists REALLY put effort into them!

On technical and performance, the game is running beautifully. RTX 3060, I7-10700K, 32GB RAM, SSD, Windows 11. Ultra settings, native resolution @ 1080P with TAA gives 40-60 frames. Lowest frames I've experienced so far are 30 in graphically intensive portions. (Considering my hardware is not high end, the performance was surprising to me, it shows the game is well optimised in my opinion).

The game practically oozes all the effort and work the developers put into the game and definitely worth any 40K fan's attention.

Some are saying it has Epic. The game makes use of Epic online services. (Not an app, just core components that allow crossplay between Steam and Epic as well as the needed files for Easy Anti Cheat. No Epic account was required when I started the game and none created that I am aware of).

A couple of technical issues I can't figure out, sometimes voice lines are normal, then barely audible (with subtitles it isn't too much of a problem, but if playing without them you strain to hear them.)

The most glaring problem is that the so called anti-cheat is doing nothing to keep cheaters out from ruining the game for others. That alone is enough to spoil the entire experience in PVE and PVP.

Couldn't join a friend in campaign and still looking for a solution. (Will update review if I find one or find the cause). Edit: I was able to join friends today with a few retry attempts, but connecting isn't reliable and sometimes doesn't work. Edit #2: Connection much better. Regularly join with friends now and only disconnections now and then.

Edit: No crashes or glitches thus far with exception that sometimes a save seems to glitch out and you restart a checkpoint with lower ammo, different primary than the one you chose along the mission, meds and health than you had when you reached the checkpoint. (This happened to me on ""Severance"" mission when mobbing me. Unknown what exactly happens to cause the glitch.",2024/9/7,en

MrMarionette14,0,29.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMarionette14/,"战斗设计有大问题。从最简单的数值到最底层战斗交互没一个做好的。制作组想结合近战远程和其他战斗手段，但是结果就是全部拉胯。
游戏里绝大多数战斗都是给一个大空地然后刷出大量远近复合的敌人，但是玩家角色的性能又不足以顶着远程火力清掉近战敌人或是反过来。相比高压的虫巢或者混沌大军，玩家孱弱的解场能力实在是不值一提，而空旷的场地设计和对远程攻击的无能为力甚至让玩家连拉扯都做不到，打的慢就是死。
弹反的手感非常奇怪，根据提示按键却不一定能完美弹反，整体判定突出一个神秘，幽默枪决更是硬控自己一秒。同时战斗中经常出现防御或闪避无法中断当前攻击动作的情况，也不知道是bug还是什么。而且就算这样，也经常出现精英敌人配合攻击，弹反之后的硬直里受到其他精英怪的攻击。
另外硬直机制也非常恶心，受击产生硬直会导致在面对多个敌人或是特定连招时会被压起身。
关卡中的补给少的可怜，我不知道行动模式高难度下从头到尾能不能每个人捡到4个医疗包：这差不多是完全回复一个角色血量所需的。
敌人的攻击方式也非常逆天，绝大多数远程精英都能硬顶着攻击换血，其中特别是脑虫最离谱。作为一个集buff，大范围远程攻击，飞行一体的敌人，居然有厚的离谱的血量，纯逆天。优先处理吧，血太多rush不掉，最后处理吧，它会buff其他敌人，并且会用高频率的攻击逼迫玩家闪避。
boss除了判定神秘之外其实问题相对来说比较小，除了主线里的强化脑虫boss有个瞬发aoe过于逆天之外别的大多数都还捏着鼻子能打。
总结就是和1代相比玩家的续航和控制手段弱了非常多，但是敌人不管是数量还是强度都提升了非常多。面对的敌人超过了玩家的性能战斗体验非常憋屈。
虽然我觉得暗潮也是个垃圾游戏，但是我认为saber应该去玩500小时暗潮再重新设计这游戏。
看看暗潮是怎么做的：
在复杂的环境中玩家有掩体和转角可以依靠并让敌人汇聚在同一处。近战敌人会遮挡远程敌人的枪线。玩家有强力的技能解场，有滑铲回避远程攻击。
关卡中有固定的医疗站点，固定数量的医疗箱和补给箱，以及随机散布的医疗针和弹药。不说管够，至少没这么抠门。
敌人设计可能是暗潮做的最好的地方，虽然曾经出现过因为数值导致逆天火雷哥或者机枪手，但总体性能大多在合理区间。
暗潮的boss相对不算太出彩，但是和星际战士2相比依然不逊色，至少没什么要靠无敌帧躲的逆天全屏aoe这种奇葩设计。
考虑到暗潮也不是首发就做成那个样子，我的评价是未来可期。目前不推荐任何人（除非你真的特别特别喜欢战锤40k这个ip并且对垃圾系统有着良好耐受性）在制作组进行大幅度修改前购买。",2024/9/8,zh-cn
Mammothmk2,0,19.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mammothmk2/,"战役已通，合作在打，这游戏优点乏善可陈，但是有几个比较严重的问题，我们细说：
优点：
1.锤佬翘首期盼的具现化产物，如果你是锤佬，里面大多数要素都能知晓，目前也没有什么游戏能做到这么还原了。
2.不愧是僵尸世界大战的制作组，做敌人集群表现这方面真的有一套。
3.战斗表现，终结技的表现很不错，打击感反馈很爽。
缺点：
1.游戏鼓励近战，毕竟近战回盾，终结技无敌，但是反馈奖励实在太差，回盾就回那么一点，前期难度低的任务还好，后期远程敌人多起来，但凡你敢近战马上就把你打趴下，游戏也缺乏有效的AOE手段，除了飞天大锤，手榴弹和开技能，一旦被包围基本就是寄。什么，你说弹反和招架？满屏幕的蓝红圈，你招架哪个？且不说招架还有CD，还需要对准敌人，还要当心远距离黑枪的敌人，好在游戏体力是无限的，翻滚没有限制，但是这非常影响游戏的战斗体验，打着打着就变成翻滚人很是常见。
2.武器问题，说实话这游戏的武器简直少到令人发指，别误会，我说的是能用的武器，琳琅满目的爆弹枪，但是实际上就是弹匣，射速这类数值的平衡，所以基本上就是一堆射速，弹匣，射程参差不齐的爆弹枪，本质上都是滋水枪，威力低且滑稽。且不说你是一个阿斯塔特，后坐力和瞄准竟然这么离谱，稍微远一点那个散布就跟霰弹枪一样。好用的武器也就是热熔，等离子，狙这种杀伤大的武器，但是弹药少的让我怀疑自己到底是阿斯塔特还是星界军，游戏的补给也是一绝，一路上医疗包基本看不见，弹药补给补的少，还分散的广，角色治疗手段又匮乏，作为主力AOE武器的破片手榴弹只能带3个简直大开眼界，隔壁的披风蟑螂都能带4个，更别说披风蟑螂的军火库比你阿斯塔特丰富的多。
3.关卡设计和任务，如果你玩过僵尸世界大战，你会发现这本质上就是僵尸世界大战的任务模版，坚守，救援，杀敌突破，安置爆炸物，任务别说丰富了，用无聊来形容都未尝不可，本质上就是僵尸世界大战的那套刷刷刷，技能树，武器解锁等等，但是，其一，游戏前期角色实在太弱性能太差，挫败感实在太严重了，技能树的成长奖励也糟糕，基本上只有大后期才能体会神皇附体的爽感，其二，目前游戏的行动模式能刷的关卡就6个，敌人的种类也少，来回来去就那么几样，关卡重复度严重，导致内容乏善可陈，鼓噪无味。40K的世界观很大，只希望日后制作组可以及时的推出新内容，目前的这点内容可是完全不值200+的。
4.游戏抛开内容不谈，首先是作为一款24年的游戏，不支持HDR，不支持宽屏，这简直难以置信，具体原因到底是制作组的功底还是压根不想做我也不清楚，但实在不应该。至于网络则是这种PVE PVP游戏的老生常谈了，断连卡顿，队友鬼畜操作见怪不怪，这里不做过多评价。至于小蓝熊反作弊？这玩意除了恶心玩家自己，在反作弊这方面形同虚设，开一局PVP结果一进去满地的无敌盾佬，飞天神仙，基本没有打开第二次的欲望了。
总而言之，除非你是个忠诚异常的锤佬，否则我建议者200+还是别花了，中秋节临近，个人建议还是买个月饼礼盒孝敬长辈慰问朋友更好一点。",2024/9/8,zh-cn

下面是我个人的一些意见，虽然感觉这个游戏开发出来还是像一个半成品 但是这个平台的潜力还是有。40k世界那么大体量 这种坦克装甲车载具 终结者 无畏 各种型号的骑士和泰坦 都是游戏内容等着你们开发 各个战团的皮肤不卖到手抽筋吗。我看评论里也有建议搞一个多人的战场模式 把这些内容投进去 在线玩家肯定爆满。战场模式游戏平衡做好做好还会有一批长期的玩家 。战锤世界那么多种族够开发到天荒地老海枯石烂的。我相信除了忠诚玩家和混沌四神的信徒以外还有一大批玩家想要和搞毛二哥一起体验大waaaag的神奇 战斗就是爽！ 想像利卡特一样杀人于无形 和武士虫一样砍sm如同砍瓜切菜 大吞噬者饿了就是吃。想遵循上上善道的旨意征服宇宙 又或者刚起床就发现家被机械教给挖穿了的太空死灵等等，要知道锤友可不只有忠诚派 各个种族势力的玩家都有。还可以开发一个单挑模式或者战旗模式打打排位等等—
另外 不是锤粉的路人玩家还是建议在蹲蹲看 等打折了在入手。
I am a die hard fan who immediately rushed to luxury. After watching the trailer, I was already looking forward to it, and after watching the trial, I was even more excited! Finally, when I was able to play, I encountered numerous difficulties from downloading, installing, to the silly Epic and subspace server, and managed to finish the plot in the first place. I feel a bit disappointed, but I can only say that the advantages and disadvantages of the game you made are basically the same as those of World War of Zombies, with too little content. But there is one difference, the 40k world view volume of Warhammer makes me feel like I spent 399 to buy a DLC. It's just a multiplayer task that can be played for a while, but with only six maps, it won't last long. It can only be said that the future is promising.
Here are some of my personal opinions. Although I feel that the development of this game is still like a semi-finished product, there is still potential for this platform. The tank, armored vehicle, terminator, and various models of knights and titans in the 40k world are game content waiting for you to develop skins for various battle groups. Isn't it selling them for sale. I also saw suggestions in the comments to create a multiplayer battlefield mode and throw these contents into the online game, which will definitely be packed with players. If the balance of the battlefield mode game is done well, there will still be a group of long-term players. There are so many tribes in the Warhammer World that can be developed to the point of devastation. I believe that in addition to loyal players and followers of the Chaos Four Gods, there is also a large number of players who want to experience the magical battles of the Great Waaaag with Brother Mao! Imagine killing invisibly like Licat and chopping SM like a warrior bug, like chopping melons and vegetables. The devourer will eat when hungry. If you want to follow the will of the best way to conquer the universe, or just wake up and find that your home has been mechanically taught to the space undead that has been dug through, you should know that Hammer Friends are not only loyal players of various races and forces. You can also develop a one-on-one mode or battle flag mode to rank and so on",2024/9/7,en

Kyreek,0,130.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012430085/,"J'adore l'univers de Warhammer 40K, j'avais adoré le premier opus et les premières previews de ce Space Marine 2 étaient dithyrambiques alors j'ai foncé : précommande, ultra édition collector etc...

Et au final, après 8 h de jeu : un gros ""mouais""...

Oui, le lore est fidèle, oui, c'est ultra bourrin, oui, c'est joli mais... c'est tout.

À côté de ça, le jeu est pas super bien optimisé sur PC, c'est lourd et confus à manier, très répétitif, le PVP est bien faible côté contenu et finitions, les menus sont pénibles et le tout manque cruellement de QoL... Et puis, ce choix d'avoir mis les Tyrannides en ennemi principal, quelle erreur : on est finalement plus dans un BTA au corps-à-corps qu'un vrai jeu de shoot (comparé à Space Marine 1 où l'on affrontait des orks).

Du coup, oubliez toute notion de précision ou de headshots : les engagements sont toujours les mêmes avec des hordes de bestioles grouillantes qui vous foncent dessus, on balance deux, trois bastos à distance pour dégarnir les premiers rangs mais comme les ennemis sont de toute façon trop nombreux et rapides, que les tyrannides ""supérieurs"" sont trop résistants (et que l'on est vite à court de munitions en plus du rechargement qui prend une plombe), ça finit invariablement par défourailler à l'épée tronçonneuse avec quelques parades/esquives pas hyper intuitives.

Alors, c'est très fidèle au lore, hein. Mais c'est plat et redondant.

Et pourtant, j'ai envie d'aimer ce jeu, j'adore l'univers et tout mais au final c'est un peu la douche froide. Je lis les avis ici et là qui parlent du jeu de l'année, d'un shooter épique etc... et je me demande si on joue bien au même jeu : Space Marine 2 n'est pas une bouse mais clairement ça ne vaut pas tous les superlatifs qu'on entend sur lui et ça ne vaut pas 60 € non plus (et encore moins le prix en collector mais bon voilà, je me suis fait avoir, c'est la vie).



La campagne :
+ Agréable avec quelques moments de bravoure bien sentis
+ Un poil courte mais ça reste convenable

- Zéro envie de la refaire une fois terminée

Le mode opérations :
+ Concept sympa qui reprend des passages de la campagne mais sous un angle différent
+ Système d'upgrade et d'arbre de talent sympa
+ Les différentes classes bien fichues et leur gameplay qui change un peu

- Un poil répétitif quand on monte plusieurs persos Lv 25
- Parer comme un dieu pendant 25 min, avoir 3 secondes d'inattention et se faire ouvrir en deux en niveau Ruthless, quel plaisir
- Les erreurs de connexion serveur trop fréquentes, c'est vraiment pas sérieux

Le PVP:
+ Simple et efficace, à l'ancienne
+ Accessible à tous (hitboxes énormes, pas de saut hors classe Assaut, Pas de glissade/couvert, 3 maps à retenir...)
+ Légère composante MOBA/Hero shooter sympa
+ Toutes les classes apportent un truc

- Matchmaking débile qui met systématiquement les plus gros Lv ensemble VS les Lv 3
- On peut passer 2 jours à ne pouvoir jouer que les Space Marine du chaos qui sont visuellement HORRIBLES/low poly/pas customizables (genre relancer le matchmaking entre chaque game et quand même finir côté Chaos, j'ai jamais vu un truc pareil...)
- Les gens qui se font farmer alors que le PVP est simplissime, les Tactical qui ne scannent jamais les ennemis, les coéquipiers qui regardent la zone mais qui ne vont pas dessus, ça rend fou (même si c'est pas la faute du jeu)
- Les respawns : un coup, c'est 3 secondes, un coup, c'est 8 secondes, au pif...

Au final, et avec les patchs, le jeu s'améliore doucement mais son état actuel fait que c'est avant tout un jeu pour les fans de la licence.",2024/9/9,fr

The visuals are stunning, with detailed environments and smooth animations, while the combat feels satisfying and intense, perfectly capturing the Warhammer 40k universe.

However, there are a couple of drawbacks: the lack of a field-of-view (FOV) slider and no ultrawide support. Despite these minor issues, the game delivers a thrilling and immersive experience for fans of the genre.",2024/9/10,en

Michelle,1,23,https://steamcommunity.com/id/coastalmichelle/,"Product received for free

I've already gotten to play a quite a bit as I received early review access for my podcast, so I can confidently say this game is worth the time of any Warhammer fan. Saber did a fantastic job capturing the spirit of 40k - the setting, story, sound design, and overall atmosphere are all very well done with an emphasis on attention to detail. Plus they simply nailed both the look and the intensity of ""the swarm"" (much better than Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Helldivers, or even Doom).

Likewise, the combat never gets boring, as you chain endless combos of guns and melee into satisfying executions. The campaign is solid and can be played solo or co-op. The operations mode (which plays a bit more like Vermintide or Darktide missions) has endless ways to customize your character - both with gameplay perks and weapon upgrades, but also a nice cosmetic progression system. There are also class trials to hone your skills and try out the various flavor of marine that best suits your tastes.

I'm looking forward to checking out Eternal War (the PvP mode) now that the game has launched to the general public. All in all it's just a fun game you should get together with the boys and play (or just ride a bunch of cool elevators together, there are a lot in this game).

Note: The 21:9 support wasn't in when I tried it yet, so hoping that comes in the Day 1 patch, as well as a fov slider. I know you want us to feel like big hulking dudes right in the mix, but letting us pull out JUST a little bit might be good so I can see more of the big beautiful world of Warhammer.",2024/9/6,en
Invicta   ,0,27.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030650901/,"I don't really want to leave a negative review, the game really is good. But as a solo player going through the campaign on the recommended (albeit second hardest) difficulty, this game feels absolutely terrible to play. You have the two worst AI squad mates I have ever had the displeasure to call battle brothers, with the most useless and unforgiving ""armor"" system imaginable. Is it playable? Absolutely. Is it gratifying in difficulty to carry the bots through every mission while they exist only to throw some mostly ineffective bullets around and revive you (which will occur often)? No.

I do not even feel good getting better at the game sometimes, because it feels like I am competing against the actual combat system more than the enemies. So much of this game is made to be a flowing combat experience of dodging, slashing, and parrying, but often it just isn't. You get stuck in animations. You get notifiers of enemy attacks only like 1/3rd of the time. You get rewarded for parrying and playing it slow, but that just isn't effective when you're also getting swarmed by mooks that CHEW through you if you aren't constantly swinging, which paired with the aforementioned stuck in animations makes you take SO much unnecessary damage. Damage you barely heal from without wasting your ultimate with a lengthy cooldown, or frivolously utilizing the very scant med packs.

Rant aside, the game is genuinely good when it's good and when playing with actual people it's even better. Which is lucky considering the PvE and PvP are the main long term focus of the game. But as a solo player just enjoying the story at present, it is one of the worst experiences I have had playing a campaign.",2024/9/6,en
Carbonara?,1,41.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014942266/,"Finalmente un gioco che al lancio è stabile, con contenuti e senza particolari bug che ne rovinano l'esperienza. Ho finito da poco la campagna, perfettamente in stile Warhammer, senza particolarissimi colpi di scena e molto lineare ma godibile da subito. Gameplay semplice ma rifinito e che da soddisfazioni. La modalità PvP è uguale, semplice ma che riesce a coinvolgere, non è troppo impegnativa ma se avete una squadra, potete togliervi soddisfazioni a livello tattico. Graficamente molto bello e devo dire, ottimizzato anche bene. GPU e CPU non vanno in ebollizione, tutto gira bene. Ripeto, erano anni che non si vedeva un gioco al day one senza problemi, un prodotto FINITO. Non la solita uscita che si rivela un mezzo casino tra server e ottimizzazione per poi scoprire che mancano pezzi, bisogna aspettare DLC e quanto altro. Io lo consiglio vivamente.

NOTA DOLENTE:

La campagna non ha matchmaking purtroppo quindi o avete un amico/a (che vi consiglio assolutamente, è molto più divertente) oppure vi dovrete affidare ai bot che purtroppo, sono tutto fuorché intelligenti e in alcuni momenti, c'è proprio da bestemmiare perché non riescono a dare priorità a nemici pericolosi e purtroppo vi capiterà di morire malissimo anche un po' per colpa loro.

MINI TIP PER LA CAMPAGNA E PER LE OPERAZIONE (PVE):

In giro per la mappa, troverete delle casse VERDI con l'icona di una spada o qualcosa del genere, bene: DISTRUGGETELE, perché all'interno troverete colpi, stimolanti e a volte anche upgrade temporanei all'armatura. Sembra una cavolata ma quando l'ho casualmente scoperto, è stata una bella salvata a livelli alti con i bot; sopratutto per gli stimolanti.

The artistic design of the stages and environments is done in the best way. The story of the game is in a good position, but it could have made your mind more involved by adding more and varied complications. But it ends in the best way. And the main pillar of the game is its gameplay. The variety of weapons and equipment for Destroying the new attackers is very well done. The fight scenes are extremely epic. The finishers. The special effects and the sequences of facing the bosses of the game. This charm is maintained until the end of the game. Although I went through the story section with my friends, But the artificial intelligence of the game is also in a good condition if you want to play alone.

Really Bad: playing solo campaign on veteran and can barely get through any set pieces without dying 100 times and is not skill issue. They did not play their own game to see that combat, while looking great, is derpy af

Will talk about it on core, i hope they see this or hear it, I really like this game but the combat makes it hard to love. will edit review and switch to thumbs up once combat is fixed but I'm super tilted by the sloppy combat in this game.

1) getting pummeled at range while having no cover sucks and we’re no dodge ninjas. Range damage should be hella lowered. I'm busy dealing with the problem in CQC. if they wanna pepper me while i'm in there -- fine. If they improve the health return mechanic maybe its less of an issue, but its just not fun getting peppered relentlessly while I'm in a scrum. I realize it maybe more realistic, but is video game who cares.

2) parry need to cancel current action and take priority over all other moves (except executes aka glory kills), and it needs to be generous with direction and timing. We have hoards of dudes crawling into our butts. It may not be realistic but it feels good video game wise — doom 2016 and eternal does this super well with glory kills. Doesn’t matter if I’m reloading or scratching my nuts I press glory kill and I glory kill. Executes already does this in game, parries should do this as well

3) I find myself parrying even if there is no blue circle. Let parries just work — like Arkham games. the number of times a sword guy does an non-blue non-red attack and I parry only for the game to derp and I get hit anyway is massively aggravating. I could have been spamming attack, but when I spam attack, there's a blue circle and I'm in an attack anim and can't parry. This isn't some fighting game where misreads are punished. Let the players parry. The animations looks sick for it I want to spam the parry-gun shot follow up all freakin day man.

4) The game only lets you self heal on glory kill when you have white health. White health lasts like 0.000001 seconds. Get rid of white health, it's dumb. All executes should just self heal. This will let us tank the range damage we're getting pummelled by when we are in a melee scrum. Medkits can then and should be saved for ranged encounters (where executes aren't available).

5) Armor is weird and makes little sense. Make it one bar or just get rid of it. I don't remember needing it in SM1 and I'm not even sure what is does except go away quickly and never come back.

6) mission set pieces seem to be designed for 3 players… a) set piece mechanic b) hordes of melee c) ranged minions. In solo, I can’t use 3 different weapons at the same time. Example is the rat fight -- I can't shoot the flame thrower, the ranged drones, and the damn sword guys all at the same time. The moment I swap to plasma gun/sword the rat turbines trip me on to the ground and do 1000000 damage. like did you need play these missions solo and go ""man sure seems like some cheap ♥♥♥♥ players will love this""

7) exacerbating this problem is the number of times I see ai teammates just standing there, or take a few pot shots at a baby tyrannid while a set piece mission objective is going up in smoke made me put down the game. Again, during rat missions there are drones that need to be taken out, and rats to keep at bay. Since the AI can't be bothered to use the flamethrower, I gotta keep rats at bay. What are my AI buddies doing? Shooting rats. Either make them be more effective at helping or make the set piece stuff make sense for solo play.

I actually love a lot about this game and want to play it more but combat and poor combat encounter design leaves too much to be desired right now and the game is frustrating.",2024/9/7,en

[BLOP] Misanthropy-AU,0,125.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006448215/,"Cannot recommend the game in it's current release state.

Pros first off, followed by cons.

1: the game actually runs well at high framerates, optimization isn't a big issue here.

2: Gunplay & TTK are good. Recoil can be felt, guns feel good to use. not some shoddy CoD shooter with 0.2s hipfire spray TTK. The Player's ability to aim well is rewarded here.

3: The game's audio feels meaty, heavy and (relatively) realistic & believable.

4: PvE Melee combat. can't say much about it because i prefer to shoot things, but it works well in PvE. feels like they've combined valheim with dark souls.

5: Customization. Follows pretty closely from space marine 1 but with further improvements. Some of the best of any Warhammer game i've played.

6: Environment. The maps are pretty with effort and work put into them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons.

1: PvE Co-op/Campaign ques are still bugged for me personally, though they work for most people. i am unable to start any PvE or campaign game of my own due to the bug of being left on the battle barge with no UI after a black screen. - The solution proposed by a comment in the review Does work, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still bugged.
(Edit 9/09/2024)

2: PvP Que limitations. can only bring at most two friends into PvP. on the upside you can't guild stack PvP lobbies.

3: PvP Class Balance: i'm just gonna say it. mid at best. at higher levels the JPA's practically worthless. The Bulwark's relegated to using their flag ability and is otherwise worthless. Melee's just plain bad.

4: Lack of content. the main campaign is extremely short taking only a few hours to complete. There are 8 replayable PvE operations which is where the bulk of this game's content is. Shares similarities to killing floor where the only differences are as you get stronger via weapon upgrades, class & weapon perks, you simply up the difficulty instead of doing something new. if you don't care much for that, you could play through all of the game's content within half a day.
on a personal level i preferred the wave survival of the first space marine. less walking, less talking. more shooting.

5: PvE AI Squaddies. while they do have some nice features like leaving executes for the player when the bot doesn't need the armor regeneration, they overall fall short. they're not great at fighting back against the hordes, and most of the time don't cover you when your stuck doing objectives that leave you defenceless.

6: Class selection limitations - Done for balance reasons that i can certainly understand, however there's no support for people that want to play a specific class. No ability to pre-select the class you desire to play prior to queuing, and having MM filtered to suit your selection.

7: Easy Anti-Cheat. it's awful and players have already cracked it. Players running around with infinite grenades & trainer like cheats etc.

8: Lack of Shoulder camera swap for PvP. It's all about right angle peaks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TL:DR - Overall it's a solid core game. once the release bugs get ironed out and some more content comes out i could definitely recommend this. just not in it's current release state.",2024/9/6,en

Одна из лучших игр по вселенной Warhammer 40000. Даже в том случае, если вы со вселенной не знакомы - ничего страшного: это отличная точка входа как для новичков, так и для фанатов оригинальной настолки.

Фактически, это олдскульный экшен практически лишённый всего лишнего. Здесь нет бесполезных веток прокачки (только в кооперативе), нет набившего оскомину крафта, нет стелса в кустах и прочего мусора, который всем надоел. Вместо этого есть яростный, адреналиновый ""коридорный"" экшен, который по уровню жестокости не уступает перезапущенной DOOM. Space Marine 2 - это отличная, сконцентрированная игра, которую можно пройти за пару вечеров и получить нереальный уровень фана в процессе.

Racoins,1,57.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RacoonSpanky/,"Спасибо Saber Interactive.

- Лучший кооперативный шутер-слешер за всё время, последний выходил в 2011, правда без кооператива!
Моё знакомство с Warhammer 40,000 было с Rites of War, Dark Crusade, Fire Warrior.
Факт заключается в том, что этим играм уже более двадцати лет (а некоторым уже и четверть столетия) и за всё время хороших игр по WH40K, насчитываются единицы.
Я очень ждал что такие ощущения которые я испытываю проходя SM2, мне подарят ребята из ""толстой акулы"", но Darktide со своим мультиплеером долго меня и моих друзей не удержал, увы не справился.
- Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 вызывают исключительно положительные эмоции которые я не смогу описать (попробую), мне как не фанату серии тяжело душнить по этой вселенной ""что убить Малецептора, должно быть как в настолке"", всё остальное нелор/неканон/ересь тд тп. Я не такой, я не гидрадоминатус.
- Для меня и моих друзей, с которыми я прохожу сейчас компанию на самом сложном режиме ""АНГЕЛ СМЕРТИ"" всё выглядит потрясающе, к слову, они оба отлично разбираются во вселенной WH40K, говорят что сделано всё невероятно, что Saber удалось передать ""ту"" атмосферу сорокового тысячелетия, подмечают мелкие детали, о которых я никогда не знал.

Это 10 из 10

- Боевая система. SM2 по нажатиям кнопок практически не изменилась со времён первой части и это отлично, интуитивна и понятна (если что есть подсказки в быстром меню).
В мили боёвке мне понравились парирования, уклонения, фокус цели, некая система битвы с боссами и мини боссами в перемешку с быстрым переключением на тяжелый болтер-пистолет, создаёт невероятную динамику боевой сцены, пока я отрываю ксеносам всё что у них болтается, я могу во время этой сцены покрутить головой и посмотреть чем занимаются мои Братья по оружию, которые вместе со мной занимаются тем-же чем и я, отрывают то, что плохо болтается, ну или отстреливают. Во благо Бога нашего Императора. Боёвка невероятно динамичная (говорю о сложности ""АНГЕЛ СМЕРТИ"").
- Звуки. Выстрелы из мельта орудий, разрывные снаряды болтеров всё звучит привычно, громко, сочно, я это уже слышал, но я не устану это слушать дальше. Спасибо Адептус Механикус за реликвии прошлого. В бою рёв разрывающихся снарядов трёх Astartes снова создают смачную картину жатвы, для меня в игре звук именно выстрелов очень важный аспект, здесь в SM2, Saber накрутили очень высокого качества звук оружия, тишину на Кадаку и треск сверчков, одно удовольствие прерывать гулким, одиночным выстрелом из тяжелого болтер-пистолета.
- Картинка. Никаких RTX, выставленные источники света, будь то тёмный бункер, будь то задымлённое болото от спор Тиранид, космические скайбоксы создают объём коридорным локациям, детализация оных, коме шуток, вот сейчас снова обрисовываю картинку, детализация повторюсь, сумасшедшая, куда не брось глаз по экрану: везде что-то валяется, будь то кусочек уже не понятно кого из Астра Милитарум, Тиранид, просто коробок, мусора, докучи всего, высокого разрешения очень много, одну броню Ультрамарина разглядывать большое удовольствие. Низкополигональных текстур очень мало (надо ходить в фоторежими как я и высматривать их, тогда да, найти можно), но поверьте на такой скорости игры вы никогда их не увидите.
- Геймплей. Для начала, мне нравится здесь ходить, правда, ощущения что ты 400 килограммовая машина смерти, которая бегает по полю битвы непередоваемые, понятное дело ведь студия Saber Interactive использовала наработки Шьямы Педерсена - это автор анимационного фильма про космодесантников Империума ""Astartes"". А вообщем и целом - это кооперативный шутер с сюжетной составляющей и с дополнительными миссиями за других Космических десантиков которые вы вольны выбирать в главном меню (после прохождения основной операции в компании), открывается возможность расширить кусочек сюжета, таким образом здесь уже можно собрать себе кого угодно, если вы были знакомы с прошлой игрой от Saber ""WarZ"", то система улучшений и прокачки вам будет знакома, если нет, понять её не так сложно из трёх способностей в ветке, выбираем одну из, улучшить щит на 25% здоровье/урон и тд. Кастомизация и ""покраска минек"" весьма порадовала, кого угодно можете забацать, Саламандру? Пожалуйста, Храмовника? Да во благо господа нашего Императора там кого угодно можно сделать, хоть с силовой перчаткой и щитом, хоть с тяж. болтером и цепным мечом.
Точка А, точка Б, хилки, боссы, бафы друг другу поставить знамя (чтобы пополнить щит), подсветить противника и многое другое.
Всё это перекочевывает в мультиплеер как в первом SM, захваты флагов, удерживание точек в PVP и тд.


- Два раза за прохождение на релизе был обрыв соединения с сервером, пришлось переподключать лобби с Боевым Братьями, отнюдь, сейчас не Dark Age of Technology, имеем то что имеем, но это не портило нам с ребятами кооп прохождение, момент с лифтом попытался это сделать (что за лифт спойлерить не буду), но там не спавнился ящик с боезапасами и стимами/хилками, т.е. они отображаются (стимы), хилки местные, но взять мы их не могли, это ещё сильнее усложняло наши похождения на 4м уровне сложности. Графических багов, звуковых, обнаружить не удалось. Если удастся, атмосфера и всё остальное что я перечислил в пунктах выше минусов, затмевает моё адекватное восприятие к этой потрясающей игре.

МЕХАНИКИ:

Ближний бой:
НАХРЕНА ЕЩЁ ОДНА КНОПКА ДЛЯ ПАРИРОВАНИЯ, (предлогаю) сделайти парирование на просто нажатый в тайминг кнопку атаки в ближнем бою как в первой части, я получаю пиздюля от того что парирование не может заблокировать удар и меня гандошит другой таракан с чёпок

Дальний бой:
Болт винтовки и другие типы этого оружия ощущаются на сложностях выше лёгкой, как фонарики у имперской гвардии, хотя от фонариков больше пользы, единственное приемлемое оружие это мельта(Использую как дробовик), плазма винтовка/пистолет и то они чуть-чуть лучше чем болт винтовки, я играю за кого? правильно: астартес который не выходит из-за запоя с дрожащими руками, В прицеле и от бедра снаряды летят куда угодна но не во врага.

Боты тимейты: Таких затупов я не помню когда видел, они на сложности выше средней ничего не могут противопоставить врагам, воскресить не могут, подобрать оружие по лучше немогут, заблокировать атаку не могут, поднять тебя или добить врага - кое как и то не всегда, ты быстрее истекёшь кровью чем они тебя спасут.

- Более чем, лейтенант

13 лет назад, первая часть произвела на меня довольно сильное впечатление. Первый шутер по вселенной Вархаммера, который мне очень сильно понравился, где чувствовалась массивность Астартес, где был мощный и сочный звук выстрела из болтера, каких я больше нигде не слышал. Долгое время на вторую часть я даже не надеялся, и вот, спустя 13 лет, снова появилась надежда. Услышать тот самый звук болтера, почувствовать эту массивность, и снова заняться приятным делом - сжигать еретиков, убивать мутантов, избавлять от нечистого. Насколько же получилось?

Несмотря на то, что первая часть вышла давно, хочется немного сравнивать с ней в том числе. Очень похожее вступление, знакомый саундтрек, само повествование - в новой части есть немало моментов, которые были еще в первой, но теперь они куда более современные.

В первую очередь, хочется выделить графику и дизайны локаций. Несмотря на имперскую шаблонность, локации не выглядят пустыми и очень детализированы. Иногда хочется остановиться ненадолго, чтобы разглядеть какой-нибудь вид или баталию вдалеке, или посмотреть и послушать сторонние диалоги. Мир выглядит живым, и теперь это действительно похоже на войну планетарного масштаба, а не на просто прогулку по руинам мира-кузницы.

Отдельно очень хочется выделить искусственный интеллект тиранид. Практически каждый тиранид, которого вы видите, имеет полное право получить снаряд болтера, это не просто анимированный фон. Исключение здесь составляют разве что летающие представители. И этот каждый тиранид хочет вас убить, и это взаимно. При этом они действуют стаями, и если вы разобрались с одной из них и переключили своё внимание на какого-то врага побольше - скорее всего, следующая стая уже уверенно подбирается к вам с фланга или с тыла. Засчет этого, каждая большая комната становится новым испытанием на выживание, и в том числе новой возможностью уничтожить как можно больше ксеносов. Думаю, это и есть пыл битвы, войти в него довольно просто, и это весьма доставлючий процесс.

С искусственным интеллектом напарников чуть сложнее. По крайней мере да, они не для красоты, и точно так же пытаются разобраться с врагом вместе с вами, поднимут вас при ранении, и точно так же проводят добивания (когда уже никого не осталось). Хотя иногда складывалось ощущение, что непонятно, где они, и чем занимаются, и убивают ли врагов вообще. К сожалению, их нельзя кастомизировать, выдать им конкретное оружие, или отдавать приказы, или хотя бы задать какую-то базовую тактику действий. Поэтому у меня сложилось впечатление, что кампания сильно заточена под кооп - проходить игру вместе с двумя боевыми братьями наверняка будет гораздо интереснее.

Сюжет довольно короткий, проходится примерно за 8 часов. И только я начал думать, что он начинает становиться немного скучным, и вроде как всё уже идет к завершению, как этот самый сюжет начал разгоняться аки гравибайк, покрашенный в красный. Отдельные миссии иногда добавляют небольшие отдельные механики, постепенно выдаются новые виды вооружения. В основном это конечно болтеры, которые между собой не то чтобы как-то сильно отличаются, но есть возможность попробовать разные и выбрать себе наиболее полюбившийся. Несколько разных видов оружия ближнего боя, разные виды гранат (что тоже приятно). Успел немного потрогать PvP, сейчас работает немного с трудом, но играется быстро и приятно.

Есть некоторое ощущение этакой шаблонности современных игр - линейность коридоров, это парируй, от этого уклоняйся, периодически убирай преграды. Но самое главное - качество, с которым это сделано. И на мой взгляд, сделано оно очень хорошо. И неплохо оптимизировано - на моём не самом современном железе играется довольно плавно на высоких, без вылетов и без багов. В нашем тысячелетии, уже не каждая игра на релизе может похвастаться подобным.

С учетом того, что есть roadmap, и будут ещё новые карты, оружие и прочее, и игра будет развиваться дальше - в целом, я считаю, что это уже очень и очень достойное продолжение серии. Возможно есть некоторые недостатки, но думаю, они скорее незначительны или субъективны. Надеюсь, что еще останусь в PvP и PvE режимах на подольше. Ибо процесс весьма доставляет

Cuando THQ y Relic Entertainment lanzaron Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine en septiembre del 2011, el juego fue muy bien recibido (sobre todo por los usuarios de PC) a falta de títulos de acción en tercera persona al estilo God of War durante esa época. Diez años después, Focus Entertainment y el desarrollador Saber Interactive anunciaron su secuela Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 durante The Game Awards 2021, marcando el regreso de Demetrius Titus a la Segunda Compañía de los Ultramarines, pero esta vez como teniente, no como Capitán.

Para aquellos que no lo recuerden como también para quienes no jugaron su previa entrega, Titus es reportado por su compañero Leandros al final del primer juego por sospechas de herejía luego de que el honorable capitán sobreviviera a una explosión de Warp, lo cual es muy poco común entre los Adeptus Astartes. A raíz del recelo de su compañero, Titus se ve obligado a someterse a la pesquisa de la Inquisición (para no manchar la reputación de los Ultramarines), pero esta no logra encontrar nada.

Con esto en mente, Space Marine 2 comienza con Titus sirviendo como un Escudo Negro en el singular Capítulo de los Vigías de la Muerte (Deathwatch), la cual está compuesta por veteranos experimentados de otras facciones para combatir especies extraterrestres. Luego de más de cien años de servicio, Titus recibe una herida fatal y renace como un Primaris (un Space Marine más ágil, fuerte y resistente) luego de «cruzar el Rubicón», una frase utilizada como punto de no retorno en la cirugía de transformación de estas gigantes máquinas de matar de dos metros y medio. No obstante, no hay diferencias tangibles entre el Titus del prólogo y aquel convertido en Primaris.

A pesar de su gran devoción por servir al Emperador y su desempeño intachable en el nombre del mismo, Titus es recibido nuevamente por sus hermanos azules con cierta desconfianza por las infundadas conjeturas de herejía del pasado, además de tener que rendir cuenta de sus acciones durante las misiones ya que no siempre siguen al pié de la letra el Codex Astartes, la doctrina por la cual se rigen todos los Marines Espaciales.

Sería el equivalente de un cristiano que sabe interpretar la biblia en tiempos modernos, en vez de estar citando ciegamente palabra por palabra algunos de sus versículos como un fanático religioso. La voz de Titus, ahora interpretada por Clive Standen en vez de Mark Strong, me pareció que encaja mucho mejor con la templanza del personaje, como también en los momentos en que decide actuar según lo que le parece correcto.

Similar a Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine en el cual primero luchábamos contra los Orkos y luego los Chaos Space Marines, en esta secuela el enemigo en principio serán los Tiránidos, pero ya en instancias iniciales de la campaña, los Marines Traidores y su maliciosa energía del Warp serán una vez el archirrival de los Ultramarines. Quizás algunos me odian por este spoiler, pero esto no es necesariamente información nueva. De hecho, un trailer extendido de gameplay de agosto del 2023 (acompañado de nuevas imágenes bastante explícitas) ya revelaban a la facción de Los Mil Hijos (Thousand Sons), quienes actúan al servicio del Dios del Caos, Tzeentch.

Todo esto dejando de lado el hecho de que el juego completo de Space Marine 2 se filtró a mediados de julio de este año, incluyendo no solo la campaña sino también archivos para crear servidores online. Una verdadera catástrofe para el estudio. No obstante, si bien se creía que la build era de junio de este año, representantes de Saber Interactive dijeron que era mucho más antigua que eso, y se pone en evidencia por la falta de escaladores (DLSS de Nvidia y FSR2 de AMD) e incluso el TAA, que sí están en el juego final.

Similar a su predecesor, Space Marine 2 cuenta con un gameplay que combina combate cuerpo a cuerpo con ejecuciones al estilo God of War, con la cámara y el gunplay característicos de la saga Gears of War, ahora mucho más refinados. Si bien la fórmula sigue siendo la misma, la secuela introduce algunas mecánicas que lo hacen más frenético, sangriento y brutalmente satisfactorio, en gran parte gracias al excepcional trabajo en las animaciones que ahora son mucho más fluidas y realistas, y no tienen nada que envidiarle a Kratos en el reboot de God of War del 2018.

Por un lado, Titus ahora no solo puede bloquear ataques y esquivarlos con un dodge (los rojos no se pueden bloquear), sino también hacer un parry a enemigos de tamaño normal, o ejecuciones instantáneas cuando se trata de enemigos pequeños, que son básicamente los Hormagaunts que aparecen de a cientos en pantalla.

El parry, marcado con un halo celeste, no solo nos sirve para evitar un ataque, sino también para estampar a los enemigos más pequeños contra el piso en pos de despejar un poco el área en caso de estar rodeado de decenas de ellos. Igual de importante es utilizar el golpe pesado (que se ejecuta manteniendo el clic derecho al final de un combo) para hacer un pisotón en el piso o otros golpes de gran magnitud según el arma que tengamos equipada (lamentablemente no está la Power Axe, pero si un cuchillo que brinda mucha velocidad).

Similar a Space Marine, la barra de armadura se regenera automáticamente o al realizar ejecuciones, ya sean cuerpo a cuerpo o con la pistola. La salud por otro lado, ya no se cura con finishers, sino que debemos obtener medkits y usarlos. Tanto estos como las cajas de municiones pueden estar ocultos en cajas, así que romper un poco los objetos del escenario no está de más. No suelen abundar demasiado de modo que hay que racionarlos sabiamente como en Left 4 Dead o el otro juego desarrollado por Saber Interactive, World War Z.

En caso de recibir mucho daño y que un porcentaje de la barra de vida esté en blanco, Titus puede recuperar un poco al golpear a enemigos hasta llegar al color rojo. Es una mecánica de riesgo y recompensa, sobre todo en dificultades altas. Como último recurso, podemos activar la Furia de Titus (la cual que también estaba en el primer Space Marine) para regenerar un poco de vida y realizar ataques con mayor daño y velocidad. Los compañeros de Titus (Chairon y Gadriel) también tienen sus propias habilidades activas y pasivas, que definitivamente sirven a la hora de jugar en cooperativo y/o en altas dificultades.

Habiendo jugado la campaña primero en normal y después en difícil (Veterano), recomiendo jugarlo en esta última o la más difícil de todas en caso de que busquen un desafío más significativo. La dificultad Normal es demasiado fácil y es muy raro -pero no imposible- morir si estamos acostumbrados a este tipo de juegos. Nuestros compañeros del squad nos pueden resucitar hasta dos veces antes de recibir una herida mortal (que en caso de caer nuevamente moriremos y tendremos que reiniciar el checkpoint) lo cual lo hace aún más indulgente. La campaña, a lo largo de cinco extensas misiones en los planetas Kadaku, Avarax y Demerium, tiene una duración promedio de 10 horas de juego.

No hay mucho valor de rejugabilidad excepto por los modos de dificultad o en caso de querer ayudar a algún amigo. También está la posibilidad de querer desbloquear el logro de los 32 dataslates (audiologs), para lo cual es necesario jugar la campaña como también el modo PvE. Lamentablemente no se pueden elegir los checkpoints de las misiones, de modo que si queremos jugar un segmento en particular, tendremos que empezar la misión de cero.

Nucleartricycle,0,25,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198125323936/,"抛开网络质量/epic等问题来谈一下游戏
先说优点
40k环境画面表现最好的游戏
各种室外大场景 绝对不是暗潮那种阴暗室内的观感可以媲美的
背景板大头和泰伦对射 再加上僵尸世界大战同款虫海虫墙，在保证这么多单位的情况下优化甚至还不错
锤粉光凭几个大场景就能直接值回票钱
还有战船上的对话，每关开始前npc的对话都不一样
大头看见你走过来下跪一排，战斗完之后还在兴奋聊天
还是锤粉光从细节和画面就能值回票价的游戏
————
优点谈完了开始谈缺点（此次只谈游戏体验，别设定敌人强度来看）
最重要的问题 人物性能过于孱弱
整体人物性能甚至不如暗潮，暗潮四个刁民怪海游泳 sm2三个原著罐头被小怪围起来汗流浃背
还有暗潮同款超烦人小怪+狙击怪干扰你近战接敌
近战攻击，举枪射击，闪避，格挡全部都有不可取消的硬直，看上去穿了一身罐头，实际韧性极低，被攻击击中会有极大的硬直，最低难度被红光击中就是半条血，一个小怪+一个中型怪就能把你屈在墙角凌辱屈死
你宝贵的两/三格护盾，只在抵挡远程射击时有一定用处，被最基础的小兵近战都会碎掉一格护盾，雷锤的超大蓄力攻击/空中蓄力攻击/钩锁突进 没有霸体 后面两个会被狙击手表演花式坠机，雷锤那么大的硬直真蓄拼刀甚至会被砍回来打断 突出一个便秘
（多人模式下因为生存强绑定战斗和处决 甚至会抢处决，让本来就纸糊的罐头更加纸糊）
在大量接敌小怪时甚至会汗流浃背 最好的办法甚至是避免近战多打远程

所有爆弹系武器的威力都非常有问题（而且都星际战士了还压不住枪是否有点）
对比暗潮里面爆弹枪毁天灭地一样的打击效果，你手里的爆弹枪简直是水弹枪

再结合一下复古的抽象单键位设计:（左键开枪 右键近战 中键开镜 滚轮切换模式/放大倍率 c键瞄准）
局外pve的肝度也有点问题，
武器满级需要最低难度八十场以上，到了解锁关键节点时，需要使用关键道具解锁后面，解锁之前溢出经验直接溢出不累计
结合这个pve关键道具不知道是随机刷新还随机出现位置，需要像暗潮找白书一样舔地图（目前打了6把合作模式只舔到了2个这个关键道具）

多人模式无法重复职业，但是切换职业需要步行五十米去找火星佬切换职业/改配装，不能一键开个界面修改这些
看上去三选一的perk选择不是同时开放给你的，比如说第一排的三选一，第一个二级给你，第二个十级给你，第三个十八级给你，而且解锁以后还需要花费游戏内货币购买
解锁武器也需要花游戏内货币购买，解锁涂装还需要花货币购买（我都买dlc了东西你还让我再游戏里再买一遍？）
而且目前看样子这个货币还只能升级获取
总结一下
如果你是锤粉 那光凭画面就可以值回票价
如果不是锤粉 抛去粉丝向游戏，这游戏目前设计硬伤较多，系统老旧，肝度较高，游戏体验较差，合作地图较少只有六张，想体验怪海游龙不如去隔壁鼠疫或者暗潮",2024/9/6,zh-cn

僅此而已了


畫面算漂亮 細看見到角色臉部粗糙 那位紅頭盔一整天面癱 不過整體是合格的

效果音 槍聲單調 不合格

射擊 近戰 打擊感不太足
我都是星際戰士了 我手拿爆矢槍一槍打飛一支最弱的蟲子合理吧 這樣的效果你都不給我 你要是嫌蟲子威脅不夠你就再堆多點小怪給我射阿...
不過槍襲 處決 招架閃避等糸統做得不錯

單人戰役 劇情 關卡設計都算合格
有數關 比如吞噬蟲群的橋段令人印象深刻
而且換了公司製作仍然有致敬前作的橋段(留給大家自己玩的時候發掘了)

可是仍然有不少的痛點 以下的缺點是包含進END GAME的合作模式裡面的

以下開始吐糟

中型精英敵人硬度不合理 幾乎打一整個彈匣的子彈才能擊殺1隻普通精英怪
可是在佈置怪物出生上面 有時候竟然能一次出7-8隻精英 一瞬間沖跨整個隊形再屠殺整個隊伍 而且普通精英的TTK特長 想快速清掉也不行
想不被屠就得拿超模的熱熔槍去打

而且你讓我打一支精英得用一個彈匣 你倒是給我足夠的彈藥阿?!?!?! 爆矢槍210發備彈?!?!?!?!

合作模式拿到的槍 每一級提升追不上怪物的提升 除非你拿新槍到低難度虐菜 不然 拿到新槍到新的關卡沒有升級的快樂回饋
角色專精樹效果不明顯 拜託你跟黑潮學一學好不好??

武器專精的技能樹有很多不合理的 小刀要連殺10個敵人才能發動 怎麼殺??!?!

以上一堆都是根本上讓人玩得不爽的點
讓人懷疑製作方有沒有自己玩過自己的遊戲

以下是設計上的吐糟

關卡路線完全單一連半點可探索性都沒有(當然製作方也沒有做什麼可收集物了...)
而且只有6張圖可以打 誠意呢??? 你看看旁邊的Remnant2?!!?!?

你做這個合作模式 一堆外觀收集物 不妨再弄點裝備讓我們刷阿........

而且為什麼只給3個人一隊?!?!你知道阿斯塔特聖典指示是多少人一隊嗎?!?!
好歹給4個一起阿!!!!!

Serving the Emperor
A must-buy for Warhammer40K fans recently

That's all


The picture is pretty good. If you look closely, you can see that the character's face is rough. The one with the red helmet was paralyzed all day long, but overall it's passable.

Effect sound: monotonous sound of gunfire, unqualified

Shooting, close combat, not enough impact
I'm a Astartes. I hold a bolter in my hand and shoot away the weakest insect with one shot. Isn't it reasonable that you won't give me such an effect? If you think the insect is not a threat enough, just add more mobs and shoot them for me. ...
But I did a good job in executing, parrying, dodging, etc.

The single-player campaign, plot, and level design are all considered passable.
Several levels, such as the scene with the swarm of swallowing insects, are impressive.
Moreover, after changing the production company, there are still some parts that pay tribute to the previous spacemarine1 (leaving it for everyone to discover when they play)

However, there are still many pain points. The following shortcomings are included in the cooperation mode of END GAME.

Start vomiting next

The hardness of medium-sized elite enemies is unreasonable. It takes almost an entire magazine of bullets to kill an ordinary elite monster.

However, when arranging the spawning of monsters, sometimes 7-8 elites can appear at once, rushing across the entire formation and killing the entire team in an instant. Moreover, the TTK specialties of ordinary elites cannot be cleared quickly.

If you don't want to be slaughtered, you have to hit me with a supermodel's melta gun.

And you asked me to use one magazine to shoot an elite, but you gave me insufficient ammunition?!?!?! The bolter has 210 rounds of ammunition?!?!?!?!

The guns obtained in the cooperative mode cannot keep up with the improvement of monsters at each level. Unless you get a new gun and reach a low difficulty level, otherwise, there will be no happy feedback from upgrading when you get a new gun and reach a new level.
The effect of the character specialization tree is not obvious. Can you please learn from Warhammer40K:Darktide ??

There are many unreasonable skills in the weapon specialization tree. The knife needs to kill 10 enemies in a row before it can be activated. How to kill??!?!

All of the above are fundamentally unsatisfying points.
It makes people wonder if the producers have ever played their own games.

The following is a complaint about the design

The level route is completely single and there is not even the slightest bit of explorability (of course the producer doesn’t have any collectibles...)
And there are only 6 MAP to play. Where is your sincerity??? Look at Remnant2 next to it?!!?!?

If you do this cooperative mode and have a bunch of appearance collections, you might as well get some equipment for us to grind...

And why are there only 3 people in a team?!?! Do you know how many people a team is instructed by the Codex Astartes?!?!
Anyway, let’s give it to 4 of us together!!!!!

This latest installment in the Warhammer 40K universe sets a new standard for action-packed shooters with its impeccable blend of brutal melee combat, strategic gunplay, and stunning visuals.

From the moment you step into the power armor of a Space Marine, the game impresses with its attention to detail. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking, showcasing the grimdark universe with a level of realism that immerses you completely. The environments are richly detailed, from the war-torn landscapes to the imposing architecture of the Imperium’s strongholds.

The combat is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The gameplay feels both fluid and weighty, with a seamless transition between hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry. The new abilities and upgrades add depth and variety, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and exhilarating. The game’s AI is notably sharp, presenting a formidable challenge that keeps you on your toes without ever feeling unfair.

Narratively, the game excels in delivering a compelling story set against the backdrop of a galaxy in turmoil. The voice acting and script are top-notch, with a storyline that feels both epic and personal. The character development is rich, and the dialogue manages to balance gravitas with moments of dark humor, adding layers to the experience.

Multiplayer has also received a significant upgrade, offering diverse modes and a robust progression system that keeps the action engaging and competitive. Whether you’re battling in co-op missions or competing in PvP, the multiplayer experience is both rewarding and addictive.

In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a masterclass in combining thrilling gameplay with a deep, immersive world. It’s a must-play for fans of the franchise and a standout entry for those new to the universe. This game not only meets but exceeds expectations, proving itself as a benchmark in the genre.

Плюсы:
Кооперативчик (У каждого персонажа свои реплики, также спойлер в последней миссии у каждого персонажа будут свои диалоги которые другие игроки не услышат)
МНОГО ТИРАНИДОВ, которых можно убить
Сетевая игра веселая, много классов по сравнению с первой части
Операции доп миссии которые раскрывают основную кампанию с другой стороны

Fixxer,0,23.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lordhighfixxer/,"Problems With the Progression System
The current progression system in an otherwise great game is a turn-off and is going to drive would be players away from sticking with the game as it evolves over the course of its road map

Separate Cosmetic and Class Progression
Having a single currency, Requisitions, be required to progress these categories puts players in a position where they are going to make mistakes as they try to kit out their preferred Astartes Chapter. Players will be in search of the correct right shoulder insignia or company pauldron trim paint and this means sacrificing progression of class skills. There is no explanation of this risk to a new player and the system itself is so frustrating its easy to have level 15 in a class and not be able to afford even the first row of its perks.





The weapon system is convoluted and tying better weapons behind higher difficulty is a guaranteed way to drive players away out of frustration. The Minimal difficulty in this game is hard and recommending ""Level 5"" to players to take on the next difficulty tier is meaningless if they have spent their Requisitions on cosmetics instead of their class skills.





This game is going to draw a lot of attention when it fully launches. People will be excited about playing as a Space Marine. Even with the above suggested changes the game is going to be a GRIND to progress. When players find out their progress is also heavily skill gated in what is a seriously difficult game they will move on to the next thing. Its important to preserve the high difficulty for players who have the skill and want that challenge. its equally important that the perks and equipment necessary to play on higher difficulties become available to players of lower skill and that the systems involved here be retooled quickly or this game will end up with a very small player base of nothing but hardcore difficulty seekers. The entire backbone of what is otherwise a great game, its progression systems, are a total miss and I hope you take the above as constructive criticism to improve the game and sustain your audience while you still have the opportunity to do so.

I cannot recommend this game until the progression system and economy for multiplayer are addressed, not at the full price asking point.",2024/9/10,en

Смело берите если любите вселенную или качественные шутеры от третьего лица.
Поставил бы 10/10 но максимализмом болеть не хочу да и идеального ничего нет так что поставлю 9/10.

В игре отличный геймплей, микс шутера от третьего лица с простеньким слешером позволяет доминировать на поле боя которое заполнено противниками на которых легко применить весь тот арсенал что игра вам выдаёт. (Игру можно в шутку назвать ""50 оттенков болтеров"") Сложность вполне хорошо отбалансирована но начиная с ветерана очень советую играть в коопе, хоть в соло я именно на этой сложности и бегал местами из-за тупости искуственого интеллекта напарников есть сегменты где приходится попотеть.

Контента в игре тонна, есть пафосная сюжетная компания с возможностью пройти её в коопе, отдельная кооп компания события которой проходят параллельно основной а сюжет обоих переплетён. Ну и кнечно-же весьма бодрый мультиплеер но вот его скорее всего будут подкручивать с новыми сезонами, те же хаосмарины особо не прокачиваются.

Атмосфера густейшая, каждый кадр так и просится на скриншот (Уже 50 скриншотов готово и ещё миллиард на подходе). Звук сочный, Болтеры бахают как нужно. В целом арт и саунд дизайны сделанны на высшем уровне.

Несмотря на некоторые проблемы на старте раннего доступа связанные с неткодом и серверами игры сам продукт крайне хорошо оптимизирован, даже на моей старушке 2060 игра на средних настройках держит 60 FPS при FULL HD (1080p) разрешении. Разумеется есть парочку мест где были серьёзные проседы но это сцены где буквально тысячи теранид воюют с гвардией в реалтайме.

Unlike it was claimed by the devs, it does not have a solo play mode. It also doesn't have a proper way to ensure we are the hosts, forcing us to matchmake into an unstable pool of players with extremely long load times (we cannot kick them while they are loading), players who are either AFK or are playing dress up, or simply hanging lobbies that don't even load at all. This lack of control has, personally, forced me to leave several lobbies nearly every time I want to play a mission.

Mav,0,9.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heresmav/,"Product received for free

I've finished the campaign and have a few more hours. I have some additional points I want to add while still maintaining my original points. I have friends to play with but a lot of the time I only have so much time or I just want to play alone. Steam having this in the single player category with the tag and, the promises of the devs to be able to progress solo caught my attention. Especially with this having a huge emphasis on co-op, that got me incredibly interested. That's the kind of basis I'd like to start with. Obviously these are just my points and opinions. Feel free to disagree

Bad Points are:

-SM2 has tried on every startup to install EOS. You can stop the installation if you'd like but I've read that it is tied and, essential to cross-platform play. It's an odd choice when most pc players (I think) will be on Steam based on the community consensus of Epic

-Data Collection is on and required by default. You cannot disagree to the prompt in game. Lord knows what kind of data is actually being collected, as I'm sure is defined somewhere in the fine print like usual. This is plainly unacceptable.

-Progression is tied to online services. I don't believe this applies to the campaign, I repeat this doesn't affect the campaign but, you won't be leveling up your classes while offline. I've seen a lot of people try to say based off of that, that this isn't a Live Service game. You will be wasting your time, you will not be progressing if you don't play online. Online services are a core part of this game. I absolutely hate Live Service games bc, one bad patch, one bad decision from the devs could potentially destroy the game and it's future. Helldivers 2 is a good example of being the biggest, best and fan favorite game of the year quickly turning into a very unenjoyable one. This Live Service model needs to go.

-Playing solo is not possible while maintaining your online status in the Operations Gamemode. You're forced into a server, and to play with others. The devs stated it would be possible to play alone and make progress but, to my knowledge it isn't possible at this time. So if you're short on time, like to play casually, or just want to play alone, it will not be possible.

-You cannot customize your Space Marine in the campaign or use classes. There are pre-applied skins that you can use with Titus in the campaign but to my knowledge the only skin I've seen, comes with the ultimate edition. Nor can you use classes in the campaign. The campaign will most likely be a sort of intro into the game and it's mechanics for most players and will be untouched after completion.

-There is really not a lot of content to play through right now. You will get bored very quickly grinding the same missions repeatedly. Do expect more content in the future but I would wait a few months.

-I personally do not care for the most of the classes, nor their abilities. I liked tactical and sniper but I cannot stand the equipment that you are limited to with some of the other classes. I didn't watch this game like a hawk as some did but, when I first picked it up, I didn't think the classes would be so neutered in what weapons they're able to equip. Especially after finishing the campaign, I felt extremely limited in my options.

-The performance in my experience isn't terrible but it's extremely inconsistent. My GPU and CPU will jumping all over the place. My FPS never got over 60-65 no matter what settings I tried. I have an good pc and even then, I don't like running my system too hard. I couldn't find a nice middle ground between performance and visuals. Definitely going to need some smoothing out.

-The melee combat is rough in my experience. The horrid key-binds make it worse but after remedying that, I found that hitting parry to the blue prompts, or dodging the red ones, half the time didn't register. There's always the possibility of human error here but it seems I am not the only one experiencing this.

-As for the editions, there's only one other than the base edition that I even consider. If you'd like to get the season pass as well as some of the skins, I would recommend the Gold Edition but, the Ultimate Edition (UE) is plainly disappointing. Especially since the skins are not universal. Ex. Titus's skin from the UE can't be used in Operations or PvP. The only class-based skin you get is, I believe, for the heavy class only and, that can't be used in the campaign. You get three other skins I think for certain weapons but again, they're not universal so I can't exactly say it's worth it. Just do not buy the UE. It simply isn't worth it. I bought the Ultimate Edition for a hefty discount from another store. I'd advise looking into that if you still want the UE but $100, heck even the $90 Gold edition just to play the game early, get the season pass and, a few skins is not enough to justify that price tag. Absolutely outrageous.

The Good Points are:

-The game's performance isn't great but I didn't experience crashes like a lot of others did. I have crashed maybe once. There were times when I thought a bunch of stuttering would lead to more crashes but they didn't. I'm reading that some people can't get past the first cut scene...

-The gunplay feels great. The variety between the guns not so much but the smooth reload animations and everything looks really good.

-The graphics are beautiful. The devs really knocked it out of the park.

-The Campaign's story although very short, is great. I am not very fluent in Warhammer lore so I can't say how it is lore wise but, I was happy with it.

I have much more criticisms of this game than I have praise but, this review will turn to positive when the devs smooth out the performance, rebalancing the classes is a must IMO as some are quite bad. then to deliver on promises of playing solo for us solo players and the casuals. This is a typical game where the devs say it'll have features and, performance etc. just not at launch... give us a few weeks and then it'll be the game you were promised. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide but I would wait a few weeks... even months then check back in.",2024/9/6,en

DaBounz,1,188.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016181539/,"Overpriced console game.

Combat is very cinematic and looks good, but gameplay is actually rather clunky and below average in quality (badly designed and implemented arkham knight mechanics).

Difficulties for the campaign are done the worse way possible : weaken the player character and increase enemy dmg an hp while keeping encounters exactly the same aside from that. This completely ruins the flow, which is already not too great to begin with. Players should always select normal difficulty if solo, especially since AI is an insult to intelligence and increase the frustration of the bad flow even further. Higher difficulties might be fun with a group of competent players (may be).

Campaign is 6-8h long, same for PVE...won't even mention PVP which has clearly been added to the game for reddit whiners who can't handle not having PVP in an RPG (play one game to see how hilariously bad it is though). So you get what...15-20h tops out of the game tops (unless you want to farm the same 6 PVE missions over and over again for skins...but why do that anyways?). For a base price of 60 bucks + 40 bucks season pass that you won't even want to farm, this is the definition of a VERY BAD investment. Check Steam store to see what you can get for a 100 bucks and cry.

Story is cool and fits well in the current 40k storyline developments though.

Money for the emperor !

Update : even though it lacks content, PVE missions (AKA Operations) are quite tasty. The different classes, with their respective gameplays and the progression systems are nice. There have been a bunch of gameplay balancing passes that have been done since release, some are good, some are bad. They address issues that are inherent to the core gameplay, and require a lot of work for the team, I hope they will eventually bring the game to an even better place, and that they will release a lot more content, because it has the potential to be really great.",2024/9/9,en

Геймплей однотипный, но атмосфера и графика возмещают недостаток.

Depression Fortress 2,1,134,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TAKEOFFFLY-ONE/,"Это буквально лучшее, что случалось с Warhammer 40.000

Предисловие
Первая часть в год своего релиза (2011) показалась мне морально устаревшей: бесконечные серо-желтые коридоры, закликивание болванчиков, тривиальный сюжет и мужики-кирпичи в главных ролях. Игра не была ужасной, она была проходной.
В 2020 году то ли от ностальгии, то ли вдоволь нажравшись баттл-роялей с открытыми мирами, мне захотелось поиграть во что-то максимально линейное и простое и я вновь установил Space Marine. Каково было моё удивление, когда все эти незамысловатые коридоры и старомодные QTE вызвали во мне не желание прокашляться от слоя пыли, но наоборот подарили мне тот самый кайф от абсолютно простой и понятной всем идеи: беги, стреляй, превозмогай!

За моментом слабости следует жизнь, полная Ереси
Отчетливо осознавая нынешний игровой тренд на полуоткрытые лутогриндилки, которые интересно смотреть, но в которые совершенно не интересно играть, я стал с опаской ждать выхода Space Marine 2. Внутри мною уже было принято, что игра может получиться очередным новомодным дерьмом, которым с лопаты кормят игроков, и даже в какой-то момент я почти что полностью утратил интерес к Space Marine 2, но те приятные воспоминания о первой части в итоге продали мне часть вторую. И каково было моё удивление, когда я обнаружил, что это всё та же отполированная классика:

- коридорные уровни, в которых зверски весело устраивать ультранасилие, превращая в фаршмак абсолютно любую тварь на своём пути и не опасаясь, что в какой-то момент тебе придётся вызывать МЧС, чтобы выбраться с локации
- простые игровые механики: стреляешь в блок = урона нет; в тело = урон есть; в голову = МНОГО УРОНА. И никаких тебе вонючих циферок с шансами рикошета, классами брони и прочей унылой ультразадротской грязью для преждевременных импотентов
- никакой прокачки в кампании и ясная как летний день прокачка в кооперативе: больше уровень = имбовее перки
- ДО НЕПРИЛИЧИЯ огромные масштабы: игра действительно ощущается так, будто ты та самая маленькая моделька на поле боя из первого Dawn of War, которую отправили на суицидальную миссию с целью размотать вражеский опорник и всех кого увидишь на сдачу
- умопомрачительно красивая экипировка космодесантников, вид которой каждый раз приносят тебе настоящее эстетическое удовольствие (в первой части она вызывала если не хохот, то как минимум улыбку своей нелепостью)
- классные детали мира, а иногда даже целые сцены, работающие на атмосферу. Чего стоит один только дредноут из заключительной главы, в железяках которого харизмы больше, чем в некоторых современных играх взятых полностью

И весь этот праздник жизни посыпан приятным графонием с хорошим звуковым сопровождением. Конечно мне бы хотелось, чтобы однажды космодесантники, как им и полагает, заговорили низким объёмным голосом со стилизованным треском вокс передатчиков в стиле роликов FlashGitz, но так как Пётр Гланц, видимо, единственный оставшийся человек с работающим микрофоном в пост-санкционной России, подобного нам не слыхать еще лет 100. Нет, ну серьёзно, других актёров озвучки нет? Я ничего не имею против Гланца, но вы там ничего получше не смогли придумать, чем взять на не самую последнюю роль голос человека, который не озвучил разве что станции в метро? Если выбора нет, дайте Петру наконец денег или дайте ему палку , но заставьте его хоть на студии звукозаписи быть капитаном космодесантников, а не Петром Гланцом. К озвучке Тита вопросов нет, остальные не более чем статисты. Ну и внезапно ворвавшийся голос Шрека по воксу в кооперативе добавил изюминки.

Я не могу назвать это минусами, потому что часть из нижеописанного отмечена в дорожной карте и будет в будущем, но считаю важным обратить на это внимание:

- очень мало карт для PvP и все они полностью копируют друг-друга без каких-либо изменений во всех режимах
- мало уникальной внешки на оружие, а некоторые скины буквально отличаются между собой только высотой расположения печати чистоты
- на данный момент не завезли броню на хаоситов (грузовая баржа скверна-доставки застряла в варп штормах)
- пока только 6 PvE миссий
- поиск PvE лобби можно было сделать удобнее, иногда надоедает по три раза перезаходить из-за того, что твой мейн класс занят

Michael Obama,0,10,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991097170/,"I'm very conflicted about this game. I will continue to play and might change to a positive. But right now these are my thoughts. I have played through the single player on veteran. (which is basically hard difficulty).

Hopefully this helps people if they are struggling to enjoy the game. I know I was in the very first hours. Even now I cannot recommend at the current price even if I am enjoying it more.

In short, Space Marine 2 is effectively Darksiders crossed with Doom: Eternal, without the parts that made either of those games good.

The combat is... not particularly fun? It's very difficult to figure out how the game actually wants you to play it.

For example...

You will take damage. I think this is intended, but initally feels at odds with the fact you are a hulking tank of a space marine. That's werid, but okay I just don't understand the game perhaps.

Anyway, you can't avoid taking damage, so in order to not die, you have to perform executions/context specific moves to get back armour (which is basically health). This is very much like doom eternal where you get enemies into a stun like state and do an execution to get back ammo/health (even has the same flashing red thing around enemies)

But the problem, this play style is full of inconsistency. In Doom Eternal you can attack enemies while reliably know you can get ammo/health/whatever. In Space Marine 2, this is not possible. The gun shot thing might happen or it might not. Parries sometimes work, and feel like sometimes they don't. It can be hard to tell when an enemy will go into an execution state while you are attacking it and so predicting when you are about to get the next armour boon is hard.

This makes a lot of the combat is more random and about chance than anything, and the game is about managing your health in this regard.

So you think, okay, maybe I'm doing it wrong. I'll sit back and used ranged weapons instead of melee.

No.

Guns are piss weak.

As far as I can tell, they are designed to close the distance with enemies and open them up for melee. Some special/heavy weapon are designed to shred mobs, but even then some of those enemies can block all ranged damage lol.

Okay, I'll go back to closing the distance with guns, using melee combos and parrys to get armour and fight through the enemies that way. Maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥ at parrying?

Nah, because some of the early level design has ranged enemies that you can't get to... Those ranged sniper enemies can take upwards of 100 bullets to kill with some weapons. That is almost all of your ammo for one enemy?! How the ♥♥♥♥ does this game want you to play? I still have no idea after 9 hours.

Enemies also need to be taken out in order because other wise you will get utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Once you know this the game is exponentially more enjoyable. But when you don't...

For instance, the ranged dudes, you might think its fine to just keep dodging and killing the little mobs first. No, no, no. If you don't go for the ranged dudes with an almost suicidal vigor you will be absolutely creamed.

You will be dodging. A lot. Pretty much spamming the space bar.

Which brings me onto the controls for PC. They are utterly utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Change these as fast as you can.

I recommend making right click aim (you know like in every game known to man) instead of right click being melee.

Then make middle mouse button parry instead of C. C being parry is utterly deranged.

Then make F melee. Trust me, again, this makes the game exponentially better.

Anyway, it' s very weird game that I am forcing myself to try and like. I do not understand the reviews that say the combat is brilliant. I feel like I'm playing a different game.",2024/9/8,en

Exemple si vous ne savez pas par avance qu'il faut tuer les porteurs synaptique pour tuer une horde de tyranide vous êtes déjà perdu. Donc vraiment ce jeu est fait pour ceux et celles qui aiment l'univers et sont fan w40k. Si vous êtes casu... Vous pouvez l'apprécier mais vous ne comprendrez pas.

Sur le reste et bien pour ma part sur ma 3070 aucun bug mis à part 1 crash une seule et unique fois face à trop d'adversaire. Sinon vraiment le jeu est nickel aucun soucis technique beaucoup de contenu. Le fait de devoir faire la campagne pour unlock les missions coop multi est pas plus mal. Ca nous donne vraiment l'impression que les missions coops en parallèle nous raccroche à l'histoire. Par contre bon dieu que c'est difficile ! En normal le jeu commence déjà à vous punir sévèrement lorsque vous ratez un contre alors dans les modes de difficulté plus dur ca doit être un véritable défi. En tout 6 missions coop, 6h de campagne je dirais ( + si on souhaite augmenter la difficulté ), Beaucoup beaucoup d'arme et de classe à monter en coop/multi pvp, et bien entendu beaucoup de custom pour ravir tout bon space marine. Je n'ai pas encore test le pvp mais s'il est digne du 1 aucun doute que ce sera vraiment incroyable.

Très heureux pour ma part de revenir chez les blood raven une nouvelle fois pour exterminer des xenos.
Par contre IMPORTANT :
Le jeu a besoin d'un ssd pour fonctionner sinon vous pouvez rester comme un idiot sur les chargements pendant tréééééééééés longtemps. Le jeu fonctionne très bien sur des config en dessous de la norme ( la preuve mon processeur a 8ans ) par contre vérifier de le mettre sur un ssd si vous voulez pouvoir lancer le jeu.",2024/9/6,fr

das game fängt das Warhammer feeling richtig gut ein und sieht in der UE5 unglaublich gut aus.
aber es schwächelt an vielen stellen.

Der Content der für 60€ geboten wird ist einfach viel zu wenig. die Kampagne ist nach gut 15 stunden auf normal durch.
Die KI Kollegen sind dumm wie Brot und wenns drauf ankommt bleibt alles am spieler hängen.
Dazu kommt noch das sich nach Zwischensequenzen meine Ausrüstung wie von geisterhand ändert. Man findet in der Mission eine Plasmapistole und ein Energieschwert, cutscene, plötzlich hat man wieder einen Bolter und Kettenschwert..... was soll das?
die Spezial Operationen die man im MP spielen kann, belaufen sich genau auf 6 stück. das ist einfach zu wenig.
Aus mir nicht ersichtlichen gründen kann man eine Operation nicht starten wenn zweimal dieselbe klasse vorhanden ist.

Just finished the campaign in co-op and oh boy is it a ride. I really missed linear shooters and this has scratched the itch. We did encounter a few minor visual bugs but nothing game breaking. The pacing is great and the cinematics give you the urge to give your life for the Emperor.

It’s important to note that this game is not Darktide and it is most definitely not Helldivers. For some reason that’s rhetoric that kept being parroted before release.

The combat itself feels incredible and is insanely fun. I thought it felt clunky at first , but once I understood the mechanics- it clicked. This really does feel like a true return to what gaming was in the 2006-2013 era and what I wish we saw more of today.

A tight , fun campaign and not too long with the ability to play through it in co-op. Co-op exclusive missions. Straight forward PvP with a progression system that unlocks cosmetics by playing the game and weapon skills unlocked by X number of victories.

Chaos definitely got shafted in the customization since all they can do is change colors while Loyalists can mix and match different armor sets. I hope to see them expand on that as the game grows.

It’s had a successful launch, even from early access. Can be played offline, performs well and have barely come across any bugs. As a long time Warhammer fan…this game is everything I’ve ever wanted. Now we just need a Sororitas video game to match…

Tarkus,0,301.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006052891/,"30th of October review update
The game is headed in a direction I don't like. Ruthless difficulty is just not enjoyable anymore. Your space marine gets a lot less armor than in lower difficulties, while enemies just become bullet sponges. Your health pool is gated at the bottom of it, so when you have a lot of it it goes down fast, once you have fewer health bars remaining it goes down slower. It's like most of your health is concentrated in the bottom part of it. Makes no sense.

Enemies do a lot more damage in the higher difficulties, so much so that it feels unfairly punishing.

Playing against chaos is still a bad experience overall compared to Tyranids. And I don't even feel like touching Lethal difficulty with the game in its current state.

Player numbers are also dwindling down, going as low as 22 thousands concurrently playing tonight. I think the game is already on the way to die, with less than 2 months since its release.

They should have used difficulty 3 enemies health and damage values across all difficulties, and just change the number and type of enemies based on difficulties, like Helldivers 2 does. They have the swarm engine which can show you hundreds of enemies on screen and they barely use its capabilities





All I'm going to say about this most recent update is that whoever developed and approved the cohesion cringe mechanic for the new Lethal difficulty needs to be fired.

Plus, this update as a whole makes me want to uninstall the game, after playing for almost 300 hours total and every single day since its release. Feels like Helldivers 2 all over again!

I'm getting PTSD just writing this




With the latest patch, the game is definitely heading in the right direction and feels much better to play. It’s a lot of fun, and I can now confidently recommend it. As long as future updates keep improving things and don't cause any setbacks, this is shaping up to be something really great, and it already is.

It's almost unbelievable in 2024 to see a development team that’s so competent, knows what they're doing, and can deliver a solid update for their game right from the get-go

The only downside after the latest update is the persistent stuttering, which wasn’t an issue before

The stuttering has been fixed with a hotfix




I've experienced my PC hard freezing twice - once after the prologue mission and another time while attempting to close the game, which forced me to restart my computer. However, since the latest hotfix, I haven't encountered any further issues like this.

For reference, I'm running an AMD Radeon RX 6800 and an i9-10900KF.


Matchmaking in operations is bugged; often, it simply doesn’t work. On top of that, difficulty level 4 operations are frustratingly hard, reminiscent of the problems that have plagued

Here are some specific issues I’ve noticed. These are strictly regarding PvE Operations mode, especially at the highest difficulty 4:


1. it's one of the main reasons the game feels so frustratingly difficult.

2a. : Timing a parry feels unreliable, although it gets better once you get more used to it.
2b: The shield block doesn’t block all blue attacks, which doesn’t make sense to me.

3. You're always scraping for ammo, which feels excessive.

4. Enemies feel like bullet sponges. It takes a lot of melee strikes and ranged shots to bring down medium and heavy enemies (not including bosses, which are mostly fine). Even small units, especially the Chaos ones with shields, are way too tanky.

5. Just 2-3 hits from medium or heavy enemies will bring you down. With the weaker classes you can die instantly even when at full health.
Your armor feels like paper, and you’re constantly running out of it.

6. Chaos is much more frustrating to fight than Tyranids, though Tyranids aren’t much better.

7. Some classes are much more effective than others, with the Assault class being one of the weakest.

8a. Difficulty 4 is necessary to unlock the highest tier weapons, so you're forced to play at that difficulty sooner or later.
8b. A lot of these issues would be solved if weapon progression wasn’t locked behind higher difficulties. Let the hardcore players push through difficulty 4 and above while allowing more casual players to enjoy the game on difficulty 2/3, even if unlocking weapon tiers takes longer.


As a result, a lot of players end up avoiding combat altogether and rushing straight for the final boss/encounter. But if you're avoiding combat in a game like what's the point?

The game desperately needs better balancing, and an FOV slider on top of that. One of Saber developers mentioned that it’s fine for players to feel overpowered in PvE, but not in PvP. Well, as it stands, we actually feel in operations. Even the campaign, on difficulty level 4 is easier, much more fun, and overall more enjoyable.

Speaking of the campaign - it’s one of the best I’ve ever played. So there's that, at least.",2024/9/10,en

lmsslkm,0,10.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lmsslkm/,"我非常不推荐各位战锤佬和普通玩家买这个游戏，先不说游戏性各类游戏启动问题和联机问题就搞得非常头疼。

先说说技术问题：
当前游戏时常7个小时，1个小时研究如何跳过epic（任务管理器结束Epic Online Service User Helper这个程序）3个小时匹配，3个小时研究如何跟队友联机结果无线加载根本玩都玩不了。。。跟好友玩甚至不如匹配已经绷不住了。

4-5个小时游玩的游戏性问题：
玩家过完初章就可以进行多人模式，玩家可以选择多人剧情（campaign）和作战（operations）。但是综合游玩了一下，游戏难度设计完全不合理。最低难度都玩的汗流浃背。角色远程和近战切换设计给我的感觉就是相互冲突战斗玩起来非常难受。

由于本人是比较喜欢狙击职业的，虽然狙击在清除高质量敌人，精英敌人和boss战斗输出极高，但是战斗设计核心就是鼓励玩家近战远程相互交替，导致我玩的狙击职业就完全没有类似近战职业的那种大aoe技能和清杂效率。枪械武器的载弹量也过低，早期开荒的低难度情况下面对高质量怪海火力和弹药根本不够支撑清理更别提怪海的刷新机制里面的高质量敌人都混在一堆一堆刷的杂兵里面。
（你要想狙击弹药循环加有能力清杂得几乎要把角色练满才行，因为答案都在狙击手天赋的激光狙击击杀回复弹药里。。。所以我得坐至少20小时牢才能爽玩是吧）

说到刷怪机制，你见过精英怪召唤的怪海里面还有精英怪的嘛？我是体会到了，刚打完一波子弹消耗殆尽结果在角落里面藏了个精英怪拉烟第一时间还没成功没打断又刷新一波杂兵+少量精英。我寻思这还是最低难度啊，弹药耗尽的我只能拿着那小砍刀一刀一刀砍，要是没请掉下一波又来了。。。你要不吧狙击职业删了吧大家全去玩近战算了。。。

关卡的话，目前就6张，但是每一张快的话半小时打完慢的话一把快1小时有点过长了，如果再碰上高难度配合失误翻车，想都不敢想。。。

总结：
因为游戏设计的缺陷导致我玩大部分地图第二次游玩的时候满脑子都是能润润不战斗爽通过跑图来降低刷潮概率以降低地图资源消耗，但问题又来了我得有至少能语音一起玩的队友啊，就现在这B联机我根本没法跟我朋友一起玩。。。",2024/9/6,zh-cn

EMPulse,0,29.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988842298/,"캠페인은 그런대로 괜찮다. 다소 급진적인 전개로 이루어지긴하지만 말이 안 되는 부분은 거의 없는 편.
다만 메인 캠페인과 PVE 캠페인 둘로 나뉘어서 타이투스로 플레이하는 메인 캠페인은 다소 짧은 편. PVE 캠페인을 합쳐야 그런대로 평균이다.

그래픽은 뛰어나고 연출도 괜찮고 가슴이 웅장해지는 부분도 있으나 역시 워해머 40000 설정을 모르는 사람들은 그냥... 오 괴물 많다 그러고 끝날 수 있긴함.

말하자면 다른 모든 워해머 40k 게임이 그러하듯 지네 세계 설정을 전혀 안 알려주기 때문에 모르는 사람이 보면 뭔 소리를 씨부리는건지 지금 일어난 일이 무슨 일인지 이해하기 어려운 부분이 있음.
특히 워프관련 설정이 좀 특이하다보니... 중간에 외부에 장거리 통신하는 장면이 있는데 스포를 적게 해서 말하자면 통신보안이 뚫린 상황이랑 왜 뚫렸는지에 대한 설명이 아예없어서 다른건 그래도 워해머 몰라도 멋있네하고 넘어갈 수 있지만 그 부분은 아예 이해 안 될 수 있다고 봄.

애초에 워해머 모르는 사람이 워프란 말 들으면 그냥 순간이동 생각하지 워프우주란 개념을 모를 텐데 이건 잠깐 설명하는 장면이 있었어야 하는거 아닌가...

결국 워해머 40k팬들만 만족하고 신규유입은 기대하기 어려운 부분이 있음.
하지만 또 워해머 40k팬이라면 만족스러울 만한 볼거리와 설정을 잘 살린 부분들이 있는 것도 사실임...


하지만 게임성은 솔직히 호불호가 갈릴 수 있는데
일단... 스페이스 마린의 육중함을 살리기 위해 모션들이 무겁고 둔탁하다. 이게 좀 답답한 면이 있을 수 있음.
특히 캠페인은 개떼와 싸워야 하는 일이 많은데 모션이 느리고 무겁게 나가서 다음 명령입력이 딜레이 될 때가 있음.
격겜같은거 하는 사람들은 이런걸 관리하고 모션캔슬하는게 익숙할 수 있지만 그보다 FPS류 많이 하던 사람들은 짜증날 수 있다고 봄.

그리고 커스터마이징은 존나 자유로운 척 하는데 자유롭지가 않음.
일단 코덱스 표준으로 스킨을 맞추기가 좀 어렵거나 몇몇 병과나 특성 관련은 데칼이 있지도 않음.
워해머 40k 팬 중에는 고증을 맞추려는 사람들이 좀 있을텐데 이게 안 될 수도 있음...
그나마 울트라마린이 주인공 챕터라 울트라마린으로 하면 괜찮은데 코덱스를 따르지 않는 병과 및 특성 구분 방식을 쓰는 챕터들은 고증을 아예 맞출 수 없는 챕터도 많음.

그리고 아머스킨과 아머컬러를 바꾸거나 하는게 구성이 상당히 불편하다. 자꾸 뒤로갔다 선택했다 뒤로갔다 선택했다를 반복해야함...
그리고 PVE랑 PVP랑 스킨설정 어차피 기능은 같은데 둘이 나눠놔서 둘이 따로해야 됨....
또 하나 아머나 컬러 설정 저장한거 왜 삭제하는 기능은 없는 거임??
게다가 멀티하다 메인 캠페인 오면 멀티에 설정해둔 아머 컬러가 전부 울트라마린으로 되돌아가는 버그가 있음. 다른 컬러로 저장해둔것도 울트라마린 컬러로 바뀌어서 저장당함.

PVP는 꽤 만들다 말았다고 느껴지는게...
일단 내 총전적을 보는 기능이 없음. 못 찾았나? 하지만 뭐... 배틀바지 돌아다닐 수 있는 공간도 얼마 없는데 못 가본 곳이 있을 수가 있나? 이건 대체 왜 없는거임?

게다가 게임에 들어갈 때 처음에 맵을 구경시켜주는 영상이 나오는데... 이걸 스킵 할 수가 없음. 내가 중간난입이 되었을지라도!
그래서 안에서 이미 겜은 돌아가고 있는데 난 맵구경하고 있어야 됨.
물론 이렇게 들어간 난입방은 50:150 이딴전적 찍고 있음. 당연하단듯이 우리팀이 50임

그리고 카오스는 그냥 제국스마처럼 자유로운 척도 안 함. 스킨이 걍 병과 고정이고 색깔이나 일부 데칼 정도 바꾸는게 가능한 수준. 이건 살짝 실망스럽다.
그래서 고증신경 안 쓴다면 사우전드 선 색깔 코른 버저커 같은것도 가능함.

끝으로
워해머 40k 팬으로서 캠페인 볼거리는 우수하지만
멀티플레이 게임으로서 게임성은 다소 허접하다...

워해머 40k 팬으로서 캠페인 점수는 9점
멀티플레이 게임의 게임성 점수는 6.5점 수준이라고 생각함.

따라서 워해머 40k에 죽고 못 산다면 스탠다드 구매 정도로 추천하지만 그게 아니라면 솔직히 C급겜 수준이라 비추

Kharos,1,146.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKharos/,"This is one of those times when I wish there was a middle ground between Recommended and Not Recommended. Aside from what are largely circumstantial issues, such as the Epic Games integration and performance problems that some people are having, neither of which I have personally had a problem with; there are things that this game does right, and things that it does worse than the first game. I don't normally write reviews, and especially ones that are longer than a few sentences, but I feel like I have to say at least a few things about every general aspect of the game here.

To start with the good sides:
- Story: It serves its predecessor well, it answers a lot of questions with some subtle references which I really liked, and is overall well written, especially when compared to some of the recent 40k lore.
- Visuals: The sense of scale is impressive, the fidelity is as you would expect from a AAA title, and the animation work is unique in the sense that it doesn't necessarily copy from either Space Marine or Astartes, but has its unique take on depicting space marines which is fluid and satisfying.
- Audio: It's not on the same level as Darktide, especially in the soundtrack, but it gets the job done quite well in a lot of places. There are a few disappointing sounds, like the heavy bolter, but it otherwise manages to feel atmospheric.

Now the bad or mediocre sides:
- Gameplay: It's so hit and miss. When you break it down on paper, it sounds good, but the execution leaves something to be desired. The ranged combat is okay; the weapons are a bit too inaccurate during longer bursts for being carried by the superhuman warriors that space marines are, and most of them feel the same, with a lot feeling like they're less powerful than their counterparts in the first game, or fulfilling a purpose that another weapon can fulfill better. It's the melee combat that is the main problem. You're better off playing it like Dark Souls and rolling around, both in PVE and PVE, because parry is simply too inconsistent. It doesn't matter if you perfectly time your parry if you are already playing an animation, like an attack, because you cannot cancel that animation. This problem gets worse when the attacks, even for the knife and chainsword, are much slower and clunkier than their counterparts in the first game. Additionally, in PVE, enemies can interrupt your attacks by hitting you, but you cannot interrupt theirs using the same method, which makes it not only feel unfair, but also weightless. The animation-pause does more to hurt the experience than help, as timing gets offset every time you hit something. Finally, melee in PVP can be cheated easily by just rolling, kind of like you can cheat the PVE by just rolling. Do not even try for parrying, it's a gamble. All of this makes the combat feel unfinished or badly designed, and I really hope this is addressed because it is currently my biggest pet peeve about the gameplay.
- Customisation: Nonexistent for Chaos, and practically nonexistent for space marines. With Chaos, each class is limited to a warband, so if you're playing a raptor for example, you will be a Night Lord. You can change colours, but you will still retain Night Lord model pieces, same goes for the other classes and warbands. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist for Chaos. For the Primaris, it is also very lackluster. There are less options than there were in the first game, and they're lacking in the variety department, especially when it comes to chapter-specific content. Also, please, for the love of the Emperor, give us back Space Marines. Not Primaris. Space Marines. Not everyone likes the Primaris designs, and I certainly don't. But I feel like this would fall on deaf ears, it's not like GW ever listens to what the community wants.

Overall, it's a decent game. It's hard to judge because there are parts that are very good, and then there's a couple parts that are really bad, and it's hard to dictate which one outweighs the other because they're largely dependent on what the user expects from the game.",2024/9/6,en
Recluse,1,31.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrantoftheisles/,"Writing a review for non-Warhammer fans, so if you're into Warhammer, I'll just say that this game will probably scratch whatever itch you've got. Go for it. The game was literally made for you.

If, however, you're not somebody who's into playing as a tacky-looking action figure, fighting against barely-legally-distinct xenomorphs, then I'd like to give an honest review after my short time with the game to help you get a bit more of an idea.

Ranged weapon variety? Forget it. You, at time of writing, basically have four major options - some form of 'bolter' (every gun that fires bullets is a bolter, I guess?) that are all more or less very same-feeling, a 'melta' (fire shotgun), some plasma weapons that all differ very slightly from one another, and then sniper rifles. They all get the job done, but none of them feel particularly satisfying. Animation-wise, a lot of the larger enemies don't react to shots whatsoever, so these weapons don't feel particularly 'punchy.' I'd give the actual shooting experience in the game something like a 4/10 - clunky controls, weird aiming system (which is justified by the hybrid ranged/melee control scheme, but that doesn't make it any less weird and clunky) and a lack of visual feedback often just makes you feel like your guns aren't doing much, even if they are.

Melee weapons? That's the good part of this game. Many melee weapons, all with unique combos to learn and enjoy, and individualized strengths even though they, theoretically, should all pretty much do the same thing. They cooked here. 9/10 melee system, very good. Lots of focus on countering and dodges, or knowing how to pull off combos without getting your health bar torn apart.

General aesthetics? Look, I get it, some people adore Warhammer and Space Marines, but like... they're ugly. Horribly ugly. Like something a middle schooler would draw in the back of a notebook while they're not paying attention in math class. To make things worse, the game has you earn cosmetics - perfectly fine on its own! - and the cosmetics will be... a laughably tiny change. ""Congratulations, your reward for completing 40 different 30 minute long missions is - we put a strip of paper on your pauldron!"" Again, I'm sure this is something meaningful for the crowd that happily throws away thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours on figures of these guys, but for somebody who isn't all that into it... it's just a strip of paper with a seal. Not a very good reward. Your best aesthetic customization is going to be in colors, and there you have more room to work with, but at the heart of your look you'll always be the same, really ugly action figure.

TL:DR - if you have friends who are obsessed with Warhammer, this is a pretty decent game to play with them even if you have no interest in the setting. Puts Darktide to shame, but that's not exactly hard to do.",2024/9/10,en

Special Kazama,1,13.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tixije/,"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 est tout simplement épique. L'action est brutale, rapide, et on se sent vraiment comme un Space Marine, écrasant les ennemis dans un déluge de violence. Les graphismes sont magnifiques, et l'ambiance sombre et oppressante de l'univers de Warhammer 40K est parfaitement retranscrite.

Les combats sont un vrai point fort : fluides et satisfaisants, avec une bonne variété d'armes et d'ennemis qui poussent à s’adapter constamment. L'histoire est bien ficelée et offre de grands moments d'adrénaline, le tout servi par une bande-son épique qui renforce l'immersion.

Côté négatif, il y a quelques moments où l'action peut devenir répétitive, notamment lors des vagues d'ennemis. De plus, certains aspects des commandes pourraient être mieux optimisés sur PC.

Malgré ces petits défauts, Space Marine 2 est un incontournable pour tout fan de Warhammer 40K ou de jeux d'action intense.

FROST,1,72.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/3206703627/,"我个人比较菜，就是个普通玩家。
目前只玩了PVE，写了一点点小意见，希望大佬不要喷我。

我感觉游戏挺好的，可以给个推荐，但需要改进的地方太多了。


1.添加更多的难度等级，现在只有4个难度等级，我个人认为3级到4级的跨度太大了（也可能是我比较菜）在3级和4级之间可以添加一个等级。

2.加强玩家的所有武器（是的，就是所有）包括攻速，伤害等。
星际战士手上拿的是爆弹枪而不是BB枪，手上的是链锯剑而不是树枝。
目前除了热熔以外，几乎没有其他武器可以使用。
到处去问怎么打难4，得到的回应就只有热熔。

加强的具体方法：

爆弹枪应该加强伤害和添加些许范围伤害

(毕竟那是爆弹，口径放在那里，0.75英寸都差不多快20厘米了，能想象一个20毫米炮就这点伤害还没有范围？？？）

加强电浆/等离子枪的伤害和过热

我战术和特战的电浆/等离子枪是都解锁了的，电浆/等离子枪由于伤害和过热问题，现在我几乎看不到人用。
特别是特战的电浆/等离子枪太容易过热了，我不知道是不是我的问题，但我感觉开没几枪就过热了。

加强近战武器的攻速，伤害和击退

怪可以强，但能不能不要让一大堆怪冲脸的时候，把玩家挤在中间啊？
目前来说，我个人感觉就没有击退这个概念，被怪包围只能打滚，不断按下空格，使用无敌帧来逃走。
伤害也是，高难度下，打一个刀斧虫，砍半天才有点用，人家过来随便砍几下玩家就得倒地。
攻速方面，为什么这么多人吹匕首呢....还不就是因为都砍不死人，那就提升速度，反正伤害都大差不差。

3.腰射加强
就一句话，敢问这个腰射的准度是学隔壁的WOT吗？？？
打出来的子弹，和隔壁那个炮弹一样，能是歪的，离谱。


4.添加装备系统
比如手榴弹包，弹匣包，护身符等等


5.提升等级上限，引入PVE专属的加点系统
比如移动速度提升，后坐力下降，或者伤害提升等

6.添加更多职业
智库，药剂师等

7.希望未来可以有更多战役，比如扮演星界军或混沌。

8.未来添加大战场模式，添加随机地形系统，绝地潜兵2的模式真的很符合星际战士啊。

暂时就这么多吧，希望各位能在游戏中玩的开心！",2024/9/9,zh-cn

商品説明に嘘がある。

語弊があるかもしれないが自分はそう感じている
前作は未プレイだが、本作は発売前から情報をチェックしていてとても楽しみにしていた
Youtubeなどの紹介動画も沢山見ていたが、言うなればこのYoutuberも嘘の情報を垂れ流していた、とさえ言える

それは何か？本作は協力系シューターではないということだ
【3人協力プレイで〈帝国〉を守れ！】とsteamの紹介ページ内で本ゲームの売りである協力プレイについて
あるいは多様な兵科について紹介する文言が踊っている
Youtuberの動画などでも各兵科の紹介や、武器の進化、スキルアップでの成長要素、アーマーカスタマイズ
などの楽しそうな情報を発信していたが

そ　れ　ら　は　ス　ト　ー　リ　ー　モ　ー　ド　に　は　適　用　さ　れ　な　い

もう一度言うが適用されない
3人パーティーで出撃するストーリーモードは自分以外はNPCの固有キャラであり
協力プレイは存在しない
上記の武器の進化、スキルアップ、アーマーカスタマイズのどの要素も存在せず
ミッション中に使っていた武器がムービーシーンを挟んで別の武器を持たされていたり
特殊スキル（パワーアップやジャンプパック）などもストーリーの場面ごとに自動で割り振られる形になる
つまり、Warhammer40000の物語を一人で体験するだけのものであって
成長要素のある協力シューターでは断じてない。

ストーリーモードとは別の、オペレーションというゲームモードで
これらの要素を含んだ協力プレイを遊ぶことになる
ただこのオペレーションは、ストーリーの進行に伴って順次開放されていく感じのシステムになっていて
（オペレーション自体にストーリーのネタバレが含まれるため）
長い目で見れば特に問題ではないのだが
一番このゲームの嘘をクリティカルに食らう人は
HaloとかGearsのような協力プレイを期待して友達と一緒に買った人、であろう

ゲームの特徴として大々的に宣伝している主要要素が
一部ゲームモードにしか適用されない、というのは非常に不誠実だと感じる。

―――追記―――
まったり進めて10時間くらいでストーリーをクリアしたのだが
前作から繋がっているであろう登場人物や人間関係
主人公の過去などをプレイヤーが分かってる前提で作られている感じで、ゲーム内での説明はほぼない
なので、よく分からない。

ウルトラマリーンの総司令も、プレイヤーと旧知の仲っぽいんだけど
大事な作戦を遂行したいけど総司令と連絡が取れないどうしよーーとわちゃわちゃしてたらポッと現れてバシバシ敵をなぎ倒し始めて
「デカくて強い」以外の情報が与えられない
ウルトラマリーンの艦隊にいるドクロの面を被った雰囲気たっぷりでたぶん主要キャラの一人である教戒官も
ストーリーのラストで意味ありげにドクロの面を外すのだけど
主人公のタイタスは「あなただったのか・・・」みたいな反応をするも
プレイヤーはおそらく1mmも分からない。だって情報ゼロだもん

そんなこんなでクリア後は協力プレイ要素のある「オペレーションモード」を遊ぶことになるのだけど
正直、あまり・・・うーん・・・。

例えばHaloとかGearsは、長大なストーリーモードを満足感たっぷりに終わらせたあと
本作と同じような「敵とドンパチする行為を楽しむモード」が用意されていて
本当に、純粋に敵と戦ってワチャワチャしたい欲求を満たしてくれるものだった。

それは、戦うためだけに用意された専用のMAPだったり、分かりやすく整理されたエリアだったり
適切なタイミングで投入される敵の攻撃（Wave）だったりした

本作は、ストーリーの進行場面をそのまま一部切り取った形になっていて、細部は違えど
１．どこどこに行って
２．このタスクをこなして
３．最後にボスを倒す

という進行を、ストーリーと同じようなナビゲーションの指示に従いながら進めていって
その道中に敵がいるから倒す、という感じになっている

なので自分としては、純粋なドンパチの間に色々と不純物が入っているのを不満に感じてしまう
もっとこう、一つのエリアにドンと居座って次から次へと押し寄せる敵の大群を頭空っぽにしながらハンマーでなぎ倒していく
みたいな感じがよかった。

更に言えば、ステージをクリアすることで一律の経験値を得て、戦術スキルやカスタム装備などを獲得していくのだけど
「敵を倒した数やスペシャルキルを決めた回数、仲間を助けた回数」など諸々の要素が
経験値としてほぼ反映されないため（極僅かにある）
敵とワチャワチャするモードでありながら、敵を倒すことにあまり意味がない、スルーしてさっさとクリアした方が効率がいい
というなんともチグハグな感じになっている
特に、高レベルの人とマッチングするとそのことを分かってるためか道中の敵をスルーしてさっさと進んでしまう人が多い


まだ先行プレイ期間中なので、飽きたくない。
でもちょっと飽きそう
そんな感じ

Pokud jste se zvládli vyhýbat spoilerům, nemáte absolutně tušení co se na Vás žene.
Pokaždý když si řeknete: TOHLE je nejvíc EPIC věc co jsem kdy viděl, hra to zvládne trumfnout.

- Varieta zbraní a armorů je supr
- Grafika je slabější v cutscénách, ale světy jsou vyrobený naprosto neuveřitelně a z těch scenérií Vám padne brada na zem.
- Už v EA hra jede bez sebemejších problémů, stutterů a pádů. (Zatím jsem hrál jenom solo kampaň, nedokážu říct jak je to s matchmakingem na COOP a tak dále)
- Mám 4090 a 13900k, takže nedokážu říct moc objektivně jak hra pojede na slabších sestavách, ale optimalizačně je podle mě Všechno v pořádku, jen je malinečko náročnější v hektičtějších situacích kdy se na obrazovce děje opravdu hodně věcí. (Malinko náročnějším myslím pády někam k 55 fps při nativním 2K a vymaxovaným nastavení.
- Někteří Steameři plácali, že se hra dá proletět za necelých 6 hodin. To bych ty průchody chtěl vidět... To muselo být upocenější než já za poslední 3 týdny. Pro smrtelníka má kampaň okolo těch 11ti hodin jak devs reklamovali.
- Pokud jste tedy fanoušek 40K... Neváhal bych.
Jediným mínusem a bodíkem dolů je možná množství obsahu při vydání, kdy tu máte 11ti hodinovou kampaň a pak 6 misí ze kterých vydupe každý jiný počet hodin, ale reálně bych to viděl na takových... 30 - 40h, než si odemknete všechno a začne to nudit.
- Roadmap je ale venku, další obsah má přicházet a teď bude jenom na vývojářích jak dlouho, tuhle zatím skvělou hru dokáží udržet naživu.

Taddy Mason,1,86,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198104361263/,"I really like the game. I do wish the campaign offered more of a sense of progression and customization and rewards for completing missions in it other than just knowing you did so plus the accompanying achievement on whatever platform you might be playing the game. That aside, the first couple missions of the campaign I did were pretty fun and then I started doing Operations and never really felt a desire to go back to campaign.

In Operations, you get 6 different classes to play as and level up, with their own perks and 3 loadouts for each class to choose what weapons you want to bring into a mission. You'll be able to swap to any of those loadouts during various predetermined points in the mission and even if you don't want to change loadouts, you can at least use it to reload your ammo. Even if you fail an Operation, you get credit for each part of it you completed, and awarded some xp based on how far into it you got before you all died. If you win, obviously you get the normal amount awarded for completing that tier of difficulty and even more if you find a Gene Seed on the map during your run and whoever is carrying it doesn't die before the end of the Op. If you find a Gene Seed, be warned that you can't also carry a Guardian Relic-the item you can find on maps that can be used to revive yourself if you get downed. Scattered around the maps can be crates that can be smashed and often hold anything from ammo packs to med kits to the different types of grenades: shock, frag, krak (sticky), and melta bombs.

The xp you get for completing the Operation goes not just to your class of Space Marine, but your weapons used as well. Any class able to use the same weapons as another will benefit from that weapon xp and unlocks as well, meaning you can spend all your time with a chainsword on one class and switch to another at level 1, but still use the higher tier chainsword you unlocked with the higher level class. Once you level up a weapon, you get a Mastery Point to use to unlock a perk on the weapon. The more versions of that weapon you master, the more points you get to spend on perks that further upgrade any version of that weapon you use. Ranged weapons and melee weapons can each have at least 1 other version you can craft that works a little bit differently in combat once you unlock the 2nd tier of weapons. Melee weapons can often also have a different version that offers a block instead of a parry (at least judging by the description in game and how it's seemed to function so far). For example, I just got to the 3rd tier of weapons and made a force sword that hits nearly twice as hard as the one I was using before, but it's speed is at least 3 times slower according to the stats, and you can definitely feel it in combat. Even if it looks like there's only about a dozen or so different weapons in the game, you will be able to make a decent amount of different kinds that play quite differently from each other to keep the combat feeling fresh even beyond having 6 different classes and therefore 6 abilities to choose from.

I've mainly been playing the Bulwark class cause I liked the sword and shield combo it offered at first, but over time have really grown to love not only how powerful it's shield is (can block sniper fire-sure it staggers me, but i don't take any damage) but how good it's ability it. It can be upgraded to not only revive downed allies, but fully restore Contested Health of any allies within it's radius when used, plus deal damage over time to enemies within it's area of effect. Contested Health is HP you can recover if you deal damage within a short amount of time (or get a finisher) and it quickly fades over time, but again, the Bulwark can get a perk that slows that rate by 50%. There's currently no medic or dedicated healer class in the game, but the Bulwark is the next best thing for now and it's honestly not a bad substitute. My main gripe with it is there's a perk it can get that drops a shock grenade when it's armor pops, but that shock grenade also damages me when it drops. Not my allies-just me, it seems. I hope/assume it's a bug and not the intended design, because it can really get you into trouble at low health.

The Operations themselves are supposed to be unlocked alongside the main story as you play thru it, but I chose to just play my way thru the first 4 before I stopped and definitely not because I lost that one. Each one I played was not only pretty different from the others in terms of what was being done during the mission, but a decent 20-40 minutes in length depending on how things play out and how mean it wants to be to you. It can get pretty difficult at times, especially going from tier 2 to tier 3 in the levels of difficulty. I haven't tried the final tier/level of difficulty yet, but I can only imagine how much more difficult it gets. Just going to tier 2 ""average"" difficulty, there was a noticeable spike in how hard it was, plus how much less stuff there was and how much less the health kits restored-speaking of, you no longer dropped in with a free med kit from average difficulty on up. The higher difficulties are definitely more rewarding to play, though. Not just in terms of xp and extra coins, but how fun and brutally hard they can be and how satisfying it can be to survive waves and encounters in it.

The coins you get from completing Operations successfully and from playing pvp matches can be spent on unlocking new cosmetics for your Space Marines as well as new weapons for them to use to gain more mastery points for weapon perks. They're also used for unlocking perks on each of your 6 classes, so you'll probably be going thru a lot of them. Fortunately you can also get up to 75 coins per class if you complete each of their trials-they're little tutorials on how to better play as each class since each class plays so differently from each other.

I tried a couple matches of the pvp with a friend and while I thoroughly lost both of them-especially the first one-I had a lot of fun and want to play more of it. It feels kind of like third person Halo Reach multiplayer with more melee focused combat. You definitely have more of a chance to tank some shots than something like Call of Duty, but you and enemies aren't bullet sponges. It feels very fair in how they approached it as well. From what little I saw, it seems like you have your own progression system for pvp and you unlock more weapons to use in it. Even if you lose, you get xp based on what you do and if you do well, you're still rewarded for it. How do you ""do well"" things as simple as healing a teammate with the Bulwark's ability, assists, and of course kills, but also objectives, avenging allies-basically all the things that would get you those medals in Halo multiplayer would go towards giving you xp.

With only 6 Operations and 3 pvp modes, I was worried the game wouldn't have enough content to keep me interested for a while because I was expecting something more like their WWZ game where the main story missions basically were the main operations you did and then they had horde mode as another mode you could play-but I really think they structured things in such a way that it will offer a decent amount of replayability and keep enough people interested for long enough to feel like it was worth their money even if they decide to not finish the main campaign.

That said, I think starting things off with a forced campaign tutorial and then wanting you to play the first campaign mission before unlocking the first Operation was a bad decision. They should have dumped you straight onto the battle barge and let you at least do the first Operation and saved the whole forced tutorial and ""play a mission to unlock an Operation"" mechanic for after your first Operation rather than doing it the other way around. ---

CaHkTyM,1,178.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198198450890/,"Пишу отзыв в поддержку игры, чтобы хотя бы немного затмить большое количество ереси, которое полилось на эту игру от залётных еретиков, поскольку когда я увидел вчера смешанные отзывы, то нехило прифигел.
В основном негативные отзывы разделились на 2 вида: отсутствие поддержки широкоформатных мониторов и вылеты, идущие в комплекте с плохой оптимизацией, то есть видимо претензий к геймлею ни у кого нет, шикарно, всех всё устраивает, я рад.

1. Претензия по поводу поддержки широкоформатных мониторов это не только ересь, но и полнейшее отсутствие желания изучить информацию, а по итогу даже не выяснить, что разработчики заранее предупредили о том, что эта самая поддержка будет добавлена в этом же месяце, поэтому ты либо сиди, терпи и жди, либо не покупай игру, пока её не добавят, а то по бреду разнылись тут некоторые.

2. Далее идём к непонятным мне и многим другим людям проблемам с оптимизацией и вылетам. Когда я читаю отзывы о том, что у людей с 30 и 40 серией видеокарт вылетает и фризит игра, то я выпадаю с этого. Кто эти люди? Откуда они берутся?
Затем я читаю положительные отзывы, люди с 20, 30 и 40 серией видеокарт спокойно играют в игру и не жалуются, причём процессоры не сильно отличаются от тех, кто пишет негативные отзывы, поэтому многие также удивляются тем, кто встречает проблемы с оптимизацией. А некоторые, судя по отзывам, умудряются спокойно играть на сериях GTX. И я понимаю, что мне глупо что-то говорить с моей 4090 и i9-13900K, поскольку у меня с DLSS на качестве выдаёт спокойные 110-125 фпс в 4K на ультрах, а без него 70-80, но когда я увидел претензии к оптимизации, то мне стало плохо.
И то ли дело в индивидуальной конфигурации ПК, то ли люди просто не знают, что такое FSR и DLSS, то ли это действительно какие-то еретики и приверженцы Хаоса, но возможно, что это просто совокупность всего и сразу.

В плане геймплея игра то что надо, заруба, мясо, кровь, чисто побегать и поразносить местных оригинальных зергов от третьего лица. Сюжетная кампания по времени прохождения и наполненности примерно такая же как и в первой части, по сути просто есть, но она также достаточно хороша. Подвезли нормальную русскую озвучку, всё как и обещали, приятно. Длительный PVE режим, а точнее операции с прокачкой для задротов, имеется, это я люблю. PVP режим для меня просто есть, я уже давно это разлюбил, но пускай будет, играть в него не заставляют. Если есть друзья, то кайф, с ними и сюжет интереснее проходить, и PVE контент осваивать веселее.
Сам я не сказать, что являюсь огромным фанатом этой вселенной и нереальным лороведом, просто любитель и обыватель, что-то знаю, что-то нет, и я просто могу лишь порекомендовать эту игру, поскольку, насколько я знаю, хорошие игры по вахе выходят достаточно редко, и эта одна из них.",2024/9/6,ru

SM2 is kinda like Gears of War or God of War I guess. Its core gameplay is fun but unfortunately very shallow and repetitive. It lacks any meaningful RPG mechanics. The story is short, not replayable, and you can't significantly customize your main hero. The squad mates are also not customizable, and are dumb as bricks. I did almost finish the campaign and it was alright, mid at best.


I also just put a few hours into the main ""meat"" of the game, which are the coop Operations. And yeah, I simply don't see myself continuing to play this. The levels are super linear, but movements is so slow and in combat you're stuck inside animations for half the time. Combat = parry simulator, and honestly the Batman games did this much better. Clearly the game was meant for console peasan...I mean players, and ported over to PC. It worked for them, the game sold a lot. But MKB feels terrible. The progression seems fine, but the loop is just not there for me.

Simplistic, shiny spectacle would be my best description of SM2. I wasn't familiar with the first game, so I didn't really know what to expect. Extremely overhyped by game reviewers, and I totally fell for it.

Runs well, looks good, but gotta give it a thumbs down. Game will probably settle in around Mostly Positive, which is exactly what it deserves.

Завязка: Поступила жалоба от соседних созвездий — планета Заливус превратилась в логово отморозков! Тираниды, то бишь местная пьянь и алкашня, заполонили все закоулки и валяются на тротуарах, в космокабачках, под космостолами... Они бухают, дебоширят, поют свои дебильные песни и требуют «по космобутылке» за счёт заведения.

А тут ещё и хаоситы, самые что ни на есть коррумпированные ОПГ-шники галактики! Подкупают всех, от мелких чиновников до стариков на лавочках. И всё это только для того, чтобы протащить свои схемы и свалить все галактические бюджеты себе в карман! А кто главный опер, который умеет раздавать всем по справедливости? Правильно — товарищ Титюшкин!

Что по графону? Весь район выглядит, как после рейда космокозаков, кругом горят мусорки, блестит разбитое стекло, и стоят целые баррикады из пустых бутылок. На планете ни одного целого угла — всё разбито, разломано, как после вечеринки галактических студентов!

Гейплей в целом не дурный! У нас тут полный набор - обыски, налёты, допросы с элементами галактического фольклора. Лупи по спине шокером, и если подозреваемый зашумел, можно и по голове врезать для профилактики! А если попался хаосит, коррумпированный чинуша — устраивай рейд, тяни за жбан в участок и накладывай административные санкции прямо на месте! У Титюшкина два инструмента - жезл и космокодекс, и поверьте, у него есть на всё статья!

Что тут сказать... В уши тебе орут все — от пьянчугов до чинушей, но громче всех, конечно, Титюшкин. Он такой, что без мегафона не обойдётся: «Расходимся, граждане космогаллеи, а то протоколы сейчас начну писать!»

Данная видеоэгра это самый настоящий космодетектив для ценителей спокойного и методичного геймплея! Пора наведаться в галактические кабаки, поставить все космопьянчуги на место и разогнать всю галактическую ОПГ, чтобы даже мышь не проскочила мимо.

Kijuta,0,27,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961778348/,"The amount of shill ideals put into this with god awful UI, just ugh.. You have to unlock multiplayer from playing the single player and the game doesn't remotely explain this while putting a ""register your account"" option on the front page CLEARLY for the purpose of getting people to sign up to their website, that think this is how you access multiplayer. WHICH IS NOT NECESSARY AT ALL, they have it designed like this with the exact intention of getting more emails and information they can use or even sell. This is NOT for your benefit remotely, but purely for the sake of making more money than whats needed, PERIOD. That is NOT an opinion, this is scummy marketing tactics 101. Everything about the launch of this game has been rife with it.

So far the game mechanics in the campaign are not impressive and overly complex(parrying and dodge system in future war settings? just stupid) beginning of game starts out with an awful map design, felt like a free to play shooter with god awful tutorials even, but maps do look great further in. Everything about it shows they have SOME talent in their dev team but clearly there are a lot of corners being cut.

The tutorial windows, that are like skin shop advertisements being thrown in my face, are not useful... and are more annoying than anything. Giant windows explaining things that anyone would know if they've played a shooter, while making me hold down a key i don't normally use just to get it off my screen. Campaign feels like I'm playing a REALLY messy/clunky batman arkham with waaaaay worse UI and a map that doesn't scale and is overwhelmingly linear. A parry and dodge key for... space marines... feels a little silly in a universe where weapons are so devastating that there is no such thing as parrying, you get hit or you dodge... Was simple and made absolute sense to the 40k universe. And yet everything is ridiculously tanky, absolute bullet sponges with paired dinky sounding effects to really make it feel like you're shooting a water pistol.

The bosses are so insanely stupid, who ever's idea it was to make bosses SO ridiculously over the top tanky shouldn't be in game design, you're bad at it and you clearly need obvious things explained to you like you're a toddler. It's so bad, even to their acknowledgment, that they put in infinite ammo box you can keep restoring your ammo at, BECAUSE, the bosses take about 1,000-2,000 shots each, literally not exaggerating.. All while you can only hold around 100 for each gun.. There is a obvious problem there, this shouldn't need explaining..... But then again, common sense today might as well be considered rocket science, being how our industries/schools are teaching people to use feelings and not work ethics tied with quality/professionalism. From government/politics to corporate shill tools, there are people sadly that want everyone to be gullible emotional idiots, easier money with less/simple PR campaigns..

The sounds... LORD OH MIGHTY THE SOUNDS ARE SO BAD..... It sounds like i'm slapping big pillow enemy's with a 1 handed pillow in every melee fight, shooting sounds like im shooting a pellet gun into air, because only impacts you'll hear are the killing blows.. There is NO opinion about this, nor a polite way of putting it, their audio team is bad. Imagine being in a mechanized suit that is designed to last multiple lifetimes, drops into world war esque battles through out their existence, with a hand cannon that fires rounds that are so large and complex that it has its own propulsion system, only to have it sound like you're firing a nerf gun while wearing heavy boots.. HOW DID THIS PASS STANDARDS FOR THEIR TEAM LEAD?! not saying the game should blow out my ear drums, just some balance would be nice!...

The multiplayer doesn't show much promise with how they're designing a really shallow ""battlepass"" and gimmicky pvp.. Incredibly grindy unlocks, which i don't mind too much oddly. Though some of the unlocks really feel fairly pointless for getting after HOURS of gameplay, like a 1% difference at times, pretty silly.. Chaos space marines jump kicking each other with grapple hooks in 1-ton armor? umm no, wish i didn't get to witness that.. Besides that, really just needs a bigger selection of maps.

Have to say, i loved some of the skins, which feels weird saying seeing they're plugging skin shops day 1 before fixing anything, Darktide vibes, ugh.. Some of the gun-play is good, just the sounds need to be adjusted. The cliche voice acting where you can tell the space marines trying to sound gritty was a bit over the top... Easy to have chaos sound good with it, since they're twisted evil beings, just fits, always does. Doesn't with the good guys, when exaggerated..

To sum it up: really messy game design with an obnoxiously clunky parrying system that has no place in a 40k setting, this isn't Darksouls. THIS SHOULD NOT NEED EXPLAINING, is how i would sum up a lot of their design choices. Go read a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ book about warhammer 40k, drop the emotional truth act, and think critically about what should and shouldn't exist in this platform. How the ♥♥♥♥ has this become so complicated when it's fairly straight forward?

Maybe you guys should focus less on the family photo's before launching a game and more so about being a professional that's making a product that sells its self. Crazy concept huh?

-----------------------------
THAT IS A PROPER WALL OF TEXT, UGH....

This is how 40k eventually will be watered down by really stupid game designs that will possibly leak its way into actual lore. Imagine korn beserkers having batman grapple hooks and jump kicking people in thee most unrealistic way imaginable... Like their team has actual toddlers in it, pitching idea's, literally feels like it, not joking..
impression of clueless toddler esque intern: ""umm boss sir man, i really like the grapple hook the batmans uses, my daddy also likes the batmans"", reply from Teamlead while he is wearing his spin-hat: ""well timmy, we don't need to follow any sort of guidelines, warhammer is an easy cashgrab, put in what makes you feel happy buddy"" Shortly followed by wadding up a fist full of customers money and consuming it like he was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nurgle over lord inflicting pain and disease onto the very soul of currency that mankind is obsessed with.

I truly hope this game gets panned out, i am obsessed with 40k games. I don't want to give this game a bad review. But I'm not about to make a review based on emotions and virtue signaling like you see across steam today..",2024/9/10,en

If you miss the mid 2000s games like Gear Of War you will love this one! No Coporate greed BS, no DEI, no ""suprise mechanics"", just big dudes killing big things. My updated review after completing the campagin on veteran and countless OP Missions: this is the best non-RTS 40K game out there at the moment! The last view fights of the campaign are the most 40K boner-material there is!!

Gameplay: Art, graphics, music, atmosphere are top notch. Its war everywhere, like it should be, the weapons have a punch, gore is deliciously over the top. Campaign is a little repetitive during the first half, a problem the first game had too. The second half of the game is amazing with new enemies, guns, locations etc.
Corporate greed/BS: No lootboxes, no microtransactions! Campaign can be played offline, OPs with bots.
Bugs: During the campaign I had one animation bug. Multiplayer was great, I had some connection issues once but thats it.
Balancing: The classes need finetuning in OP/MP, also some weapons.
Difficulty: Played campaign on veteran. Its a challenge sometimes, the defense sections can be hard, but otherwise than that its doable.
Multiplayer: Coop so far was VERY fun and this is where SM2 shines the most!

Verdict so far: To my knowledge everything is lore accurate, they went into great detail in this one. Big dudes with bigger weapons killing stuff, this is what I want to see! If you know 40K you will love this game, its a love letter to all the fans!

Dla wszystkich, którzy czekali na dalszy ciąg historii kapitana Demetriana Titusa, Saber Interactive postanowił przygotować chyba jedną z większych niespodzianek, jeżeli chodzi o premiery 2024 roku. Ultramarine dubbingowany przez kapitalnego Marka Stronga powraca, a wraz z nim i Wy będziecie mieli okazję zmierzyć się z największymi wrogami ludzkości w osadzonym w 40 milenium świecie Warhammera. Czy to udany powrót? Nie narażę się chyba Inkwizycji, jeżeli powiem - jak najbardziej!

The Emperor protects!

Od wydarzeń z pierwszej części gry minęło ponad 200 lat, w trakcie których Titus odbywał swoją pokutę w szeregach Straży Śmierci. W grywalnym samouczku towarzyszymy mu w trakcie jednej z operacji, w której bohater prawie traci życie, stając twarzą w twarz z przeważającymi siłami Tyranidów i pojedynkując się z ogromnym Carnifexem. ""Imperator chroni"" to jednak nie są słowa rzucane na wiatr, więc nasz bohater zostaje poskładany do kupy na pokładzie okrętu wojennego i po raz kolejny trafia na ślad spisku sił chaosu.

Szkielet fabuły pozostaje tutaj podobny do tego, który znamy z pierwszej części. Walka z Tyranidami okazuje się tylko wstępem do inwazji sił Chaosu, a nierozważne zabawy z reliktami osnowy, które uskuteczniają kapłani Adeptus Mechanicus jak nic przypominają graczowi podobne praktyki Inkwizycji z pierwszej części przygód kosmicznego marine. Akcja pędzi na tyle wartko, że zamiast zastanawiać się nad meandrami scenariusza i tak raczej rzucicie się z młotem i bolterem do walki, więc zamiast szukać dziur w całym, lepiej spojrzeć na to, co stanowi najważniejszą część rozgrywki - walkę!


Obcych będziecie ciąć, miażdżyć i rozrywać na strzępy za pomocą całkiem sporego arsenału, zdecydowanie większego niż w pierwszej części. W walce wręcz skorzystacie z czterech różnych rodzajów oręża, do tego dojdzie kilka rodzajów broni bocznej i kilkanaście większych karabinów i miotaczy do walki na krótki, średni i długi dystans.

Arsenał całkiem pokaźny, ale wielkość usprawiedliwiona, jeżeli spojrzeć na to, z kim przyjdzie nam walczyć. Jakimś cudem udało się twórcom przygotować jeszcze większe starcia niż w pierwszej części, a dzięki umiejętnościom Titusa rzucając się nawet na kilkudziesięciu wrogów na raz nie będziecie czuć się bezbronni. Miks walki w zwarciu i wykorzystania broni bocznej nie tylko zapewni ciągłą presję na przeciwnikach, ale w newralgicznych momentach egzekucje na wrogach odnowią życie i pancerz naszego bohatera. Walka to prawdziwa wizyta w rzeźni - krew bucha na wszystkie strony, odcięte kończyny i rozerwane ciała ścielą się gęsto pod stopami potężnego pancerza wspomaganego naszego bohatera.

Sam zapamiętałem pierwszą część gry jako dość monotonne przebijanie się przez kolejne fale przeciwników. Dwójeczka jest moim zdaniem zdecydowanie bardziej dynamiczna, a większa liczba zdolności bohatera w walce wręcz, broni oraz zróżnicowania misji sprawia, że czujemy się cały czas zaangażowani w to, co widzimy na ekranie.


Na uwagę zasługuje zarówno oprawa graficzna, jak i dźwiękowa - moim zdaniem naprawdę jedna i druga robią duże wrażenie. Na ekranie kłębią się roje wrogów, zarówno w powietrzu jak i na ziemi chmary Tyranidów szturmują raz po raz pozycje Gwardii Imperialnej i próbują przeszkodzić naszemu bohaterowi i jego drużynie. Towarzyszą temu rzecz jasna sugestywne odgłosy wybuchów, krzyki wrogów i sojuszników. Dudnienie bolterów, przeszywający powietrze dźwięk laserów i walnięcia w ziemię potężnego elektrycznego młota przyprawiają o ciarki na plecach, a jeżeli dołożymy do tego naprawdę niezły dubbing i aktorów, którzy z zaangażowaniem wypowiadają swoje kwestie, to dostajemy naprawdę udaną mieszankę.


- krwawa jatka bez trzymanki;
- satysfakcjonujący feeling walki;
- poprawione mankamenty pierwszej części;
- ładna oprawa graficzna;
- świetna oprawa dźwiękowa;

- zbyt wyraźnie powtarza schemat fabularny pierwszej części;
- okazjonalne problemy z połączeniem z innymi graczami;
- przydałby się jakiś rozwój zdolności Titusa, a nie tylko towarzyszących mu wojowników w ramach Operacji;
- brak aktywności pobocznych w bazie operacyjnej;
- względnie mało misji w trybie Operacje (choć ciągle dochodzą nowe);",2024/9/9,pl

В игре прям очень много болтерного (будет считать гмо огнестрелом) мейн оружия, а вот рукопашного всего 4 (в мп ещё есть завезли поверфистинг) 3 пистолета и 3 тяжелого оружия (в мп и сингле разный третий ствол) и при этом патронов часто хватает, раздачники патронов часто встречаются на аренах и в целом нет врага которого нельзя тупо растрелять. Так же переход к системе двух хп когда здоровье не регенится без ульты и аптечек,а броня по факту восполняемое хп подталкивает чаще отстреливатся из укрытий. за рукопашку во главе угла говорит сильно прокаченая система боя где добавили к перекатам блок, все выпады врагов имеют визуальный маркер и даже указан тип защиты для противодействия, рукопашные атаки могу застанить под квик шот халявный на реген брони а добивания не ток восполняют броню, но и неуязвимы на время анимации (как и перекат). И при этом больше не выйдет пострелять нормально от бедра дальше вытянутой руки - извольте переходить в режим стрельбы что блочит добивание и снижает мобильность. Суть гемплея как раз в частом комбинировании этих двух режимов.

Сама игра чётко делится на три режима - сюжет, пве и пвп. Сюжетная кампания построенна на ликалах игр нулевых и десятых. Много эпичных кадров, пафоса (а у нас тут варшлёп 40к на минуту) и разных ситуаций (то защищай это, то прыгай с джетпаком, то гоняй рой). Кампания средня по продолжительности (часов +-8) кишкобразная без собирательства и рпг элементов или стелса. Беги стреляй, убивай, смотри мультки... И это хорошо, ибо добро сделаная попкорновая сюжетка в наши дни редкость. Сам сюжет не замысловат, есть атмосфера бадимуви, но местами диалоги больше пафосные, чем интересные(есть пара прям отличных, но порой тупо разговор у кого долг больше). В целом впечатления хорошие, НО игра словно затачивалась под кооп от чего некоторые момент бесят - крути винт пока ии компетентно (нет) тебя прикрывает.

ПвЕ у нас этакий дарктайд на максималках. Во первых самое крутое - наши миссии вплетены в основной сюжет и нам по ходу игры говорят ""действуют два отряда, ваша цель такая, а они будут делать такое"" и можно даже порой между миссиями поболтать гг с игроками коопа. Сами мисси имеют чёткую задачу и врагов, но само наполнение и динамика задания меняется по прихоти режиссёра .У нас 6 классов, кажды представляет из себя конкретного бойца б тима но кроме лиц редактируем всё (об этом позже). Оружие доступно сразу всё, за прокачку класса мы открываем пасивные перки (активка у классов всегда прописана) и за использования оружия мы качаем его мастерство открывая варианты и перки. И тут большой минус ибо в игре очень сурово поделили сволы по классам. Солдат бегает аж с 7 пушками на выбор, а у авангарда их всего 3, зато есть выбор между мечом или ножом, снайпер же даже не может пистолет себе выбрать. В принципе это хорошо сделаный режим с парой отличный идей (точки где можно сменить набор оружия по ходу задания и офицеры что могут призвать подкоепы если их быстро не устранить)

Про врагов. Тираниды шикарно сделаны, есть множество вариантов войнов и прикольные особые враги.прикольная связь элитов и мяса, элиты ну прилично жирные, а мясо очень даде мешает и демажет... НО, ПРИ СМЕРТИ ЭЛИТА МЕЛОЧ ОТЛЕТАЕТ ВОКРУГ. Это даёт неплохую динамику когда ты либо концентрируешься на жёстком файте с элитами или осторожно выкашиваешь мясо ради лучшего боя с элитами (и благодоря маркерам легко читать откуда угроза) само поведение тиранидов радует - бегут роем по при обстреле бросаются в расыпную, когда элит фокусит игрока пытаются со спины подгадить ну и есть моменты где они как в фильмазъх друг по другу лезут на стены. Хаоситы же вышле более класическими но в отличии от первой части не превращают игру в шутер с укрытиями. Достаточно хорошоре разнообразие врагов (хотя щитоносцы тзангоры как-то слишком хорошо держут удар) и так же как с тиранидами с ними играть не выйдет.

И про ПвП это класический арена шутер притом прям ну эталонно класический. 6 на 6 без дропов, три режима. Забавно но тут хп само регенится. Достаточно весело и ттк достаточно высокий чтобы при хорошем уровне игры побеждать. Никаких перков ,модулей и прочего, чисто берём класс и оружие (за уровни пвп мы эти самые пушки и открываем). Главный минус это отсутвие skill-based матчмейкинга, так что часто матчи идут в одну калитку, даже если ты тащумба , игра просто могла кинуть тебе вась подпивасов а врагам набрать играков что каждый день по 6 часов минимум играют. Кстати, хаоситы у нас вместо классов фактически поделены на легионы со своей специализацией (клоны см геймплейно) а вот что грустно - кастомизировать можно ток раскраску брони, нет ни скинов оружия, не деталей брони.

Кстати о кастомизации... Она оболденная, можно каждую колленку настроить, вариантов цветов много, деталик пока не прям много... Но как бы уже есть сизон пасс и там только косметика. В целом разрабы обещали только косметику монетизировать без микротранзакций а из разряда купил 1 раз пак. По графону и оптимизации. Играл на двух машинах. В целом игра работает не плохо, но у многих необосновано нагревает процессор и есть баги соьзвуком и роликами.

По итогу игра сделана почти 1 в 1 как условный гирз оф вар 2 с иксбокс 360... И это хорошо, так сейчас уже редко делают",2024/9/8,ru

3 карты! Всего 3 карты, для столь крупного проекта где не особо нужно заморачиваться с логикой этих карт или балансом, а просто достаточно добавить разнообразия, но нет они сделали 3 карты максимально простыми и симметричными с максимальным пох***мом!

Весь геймплей в пвп это просто team shot! как бы вы не старались даже самые отъявленные да*ны вас убьют если их двое и вы и они в открытой позиции у вас нет шанса обернуть в свою сторону данную ситуацию!

ХОРОШАЯ КАСТОМИЗАЦИЯ где?????
1 из дней меня кидало только за сторону хаос, у которой просто напрочь отсутствует кастомизация, да компания у нас не включает игру за хаос ибо это ересь и за мной уже выехали инквизиторы, но БЛ**Ь бегать в одном пресете брони в сетевом режиме без возможности, что то изменить кроме ордена, это такая же ересь как и жаловаться на одиночную ""ААААААААААА"" игру с плохим ПВП


Класс со щитом отдельный вид аутизма, как вы не старайтесь, какое оружие не используйте им пох*ру они просто стоят и впитывают урон, к примеру у девостаторов есть энерго щит который при нанесении урона ломается почему не сделать стамину у щитовика что бы он как да*н не стоял с зажатой кнопкой блока или что бы проходил процент урона от попадания со временем увеличивающийся? Но видимо желание думать о ПВП режиме напрочь отсутствовало!

Надеюсь над ПВП будут работать и развивать так как не хотелось бы быстро забывать об этой игре!
Так же разработчикам может быть интересно добавить всяких dlc и прочего контента для удержания в игре большого количества игроков на продолжительное время, так как сейчас ситуация такова, что компанию при спокойном геймплее можно пройти часов за 8 если не меньше а дальше, что? просто забыть?

MicNat666,1,30.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/micnat/,"Jako fan Uniwersum Warhammera 40,000 od 1998 roku, muszę przyznać, że Space Marine 2 to prawdziwy hołd dla tego niesamowitego świata. Gra idealnie uchwyciła brutalność, epickość i bezkompromisowy charakter bitew znanych z uniwersum, jednocześnie dostarczając satysfakcjonującej i dynamicznej rozgrywki. Od pierwszych chwil czułem, jakby cała historia, którą śledziłem przez dekady, ożywała na ekranie.

Kontynuacja przygód Ultramarine'ów nie zawiodła. Akcja jest intensywna, pełna niesamowitych momentów, które sprawiają, że czułem się, jakby sam Imperator prowadził mnie do boju. Walka z hordami Tyranidów to czysta rozkosz dla każdego fana tego świata. Animacje, dźwięki, a zwłaszcza design wrogów i środowisk, oddają mroczny i gotycki klimat 41. millenium. Każdy krok bohatera – od ryku boltera, przez majestatyczne wybuchy, po dźwięk ciężkich butów Space Marine na metalowej powierzchni – przypomina mi, dlaczego Warhammer 40,000 to uniwersum pełne niesamowitej głębi i unikalnej atmosfery.

Mechanika gry została udoskonalona w stosunku do poprzedniej części. Nowe ruchy i płynność w walce pozwalają poczuć się, jak prawdziwy Astartes – nadludzko szybki, silny i bezlitosny. Do tego dodajmy epickie starcia, które ukazują bezmiar i skomplikowanie bitew Warhammera.

Co najważniejsze, Space Marine 2 nie jest tylko grą akcji – to przeżycie, które pozwala na nowo poczuć dumę i chwałę Ultramarines, którzy stoją na straży Imperium. Fani Uniwersum Warhammera na pewno będą zachwyceni, widząc, jak wiernie oddano lore, a nowe wątki fabularne tylko pogłębiają zainteresowanie tym fantastycznym światem.

Dla każdego fana – zarówno nowicjusza, jak i weterana od 1998 roku – Space Marine 2 to obowiązkowa pozycja, która doskonale łączy dynamikę gry akcji z bogatym dziedzictwem Warhammera 40,000. Polecam z całego serca!",2024/9/8,pl

Mister Kad,1,45,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mister_Kad/,"Gonna be completely honest, after the first 30 minutes of optimization hell, I am safe to say that the early trials were worth it. A story that sticks to the core of 40k, the beautiful, immersive set pieces. This is THE 40k game I've been waiting for. The combat system has taken some time to get used to, but there's nothing more satisfying than pulling off a chain of executions and heavy hitting slams into the horde that surrounds you (before you turn the entire place into a red mist). And it's not just the melee. The ranged weapons have the most satisfying bolter punches I've seen in a 40k game yet.

The multiplayer PVP mode could use some balancing, and the campaign AI really needs a tweak or two, but this is something that nobody is a stranger to at this point. It's an expected headache when you make gameplay surrounding co-op and then give us robots with the brains of a sloth to back us up.

I accidentally purchased the early access pre-order, but as far as I'm concerned, it's been worth every penny, and will be for a long time to come. Especially with the solid replay value. I may have distrust in GW, but nonetheless I am very content with Space Marine 2.",2024/9/6,en

XP0M,1,44.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xpom23/,"Шикарная игра. И отличное продолжение. Не зря столько лет ждал.

Сюжет в какой-то мере повторяет первую часть, потому как не учатся ничему некоторые, и учиться не хотят. Но даже не смотря на вторичность сюжета, исполнение выше всяких похвал. Уделено большое внимание к деталям игрового мира, сочные взрывы и стрельба, достойное звуковое сопровождение и общая эпичность происходящего на экране надолго осядут в памяти.
Помимо сюжета имеются 6 операций, которые происходят параллельно основному сюжету. Играть можно с ботами, но на сложностях выше нормальной с ботами играть больно, потому что они тупенькие, не добивают врагов, не захватывают точки и не выполняют различные сюжетные действия, а одному успеть всюду сложновато. Поэтому рекомендую играть в кооперативе. Благо, подбор игроков происходит быстро.
Мультиплеерные бои по классике быстрые и несложные. Хотя уже сейчас есть игроки, которые в совершенстве изучили локации и прокачали своих бойцов. Но прокачка дело времени. Просто играем и получаем удовольствие.

Space Marine II работает на собственном движке Swarm Engine, и это, пожалуй, одна из немногих игр, которые наконец-то демонстрируют тот самый «почти некстген». От детализации окружения, брони персонажей, дальности прорисовки, потрясающего освещения и масштабов игры порой попросту захватывает дух. Одним из самых заметных изменений в игре является ее визуальное оформление, детализированные модели персонажей и окружения, мрачные, кровавые пейзажи и эпичные и масштабные сцены сражений создают непередаваемую атмосферу, которая идеально соответствует духу вселенной Warhammer 40К. Звуковое оформление также на высоте — динамичные и напряженные бои сопровождаются мощными звуковыми эффектами и грандиозным музыкальным сопровождением, которое делает каждый бой еще более запоминающимся. Также разработчики учли критику и отзывы игроков о первой части, внедрив ряд значительных улучшений. Одним из главных нововведений стала более крутая и глубокая боевка. Теперь игрокам предстоит сталкиваться с еще более разнообразными врагами, каждый из которых требует особого подхода и стратегии. Система прокачки персонажей также была значительно расширена, предоставляя больше возможностей для кастомизации и развития навыков героя (но это по большей части сделано для коопа, для кампании сделан просто выбор оружия, ну и 2 два вида брони, если у вас Delux издание).

Сюжет в Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 звезд с неба не хватает, но он стал более насыщенным. Он продолжает развивать историю оригинала, но при этом вводит новые элементы, которые добавляют глубины. Персонажи, как новые, так и знакомые с первой части, получили более проработанные истории и мотивации, что позволяет игрокам глубже погружаться в происходящее. Описать весь сюжет можно буквально в двух предложениях, поскольку история здесь служит скорее причиной что-нибудь взорвать и кого-нибудь уничтожить. Большая часть заданий сводится к тому, что герои должны заложить бомбу, навести пушку или не дать монстрам уничтожить важный объект, а основной конфликт развивается на фоне, лишь в финальной трети давая о себе знать. В принципе, от сюжета во вселенной Warhammer большего и не требуется.

Если подвести итоги, новый Space Marinе в 2024 году выглядит как идеальный боевик в мире Warhammer 40К, как мессия жанра, с болтером в одной руке и пиломечом в другой. Новая часть несомненно оправдал все мои ожидания и принесла множество нововведений, которые делают игру не только попкорновым и мясным зрелищем с отличной графикой, захватывающим звуковым оформлением и улучшенной механикой, но и представляет собой достойное продолжение, если так можно сказать «успешного» оригинала. Если вы являетесь поклонником вселенной Warhammer 40К или просто любите качественные экшен-игры типа Gear of War, это продолжение определенно стоит вашего внимания. Несмотря на ряд недостатков, проведённые в сюжетной кампании Space Marine II 10 часов подарили мне одни из самых приятных впечатлений в 2024 году — именно такой игры нам всем не хватало последние лет пять.",2024/9/7,ru

А где повестка? Почему нет женщин астартес?!


Играть только на самом высоком уровне сложности, серьёзно!


Мясная игра, отличное продолжение первой части!
Это если в двух словах, далее по игре.
Начало, лично для меня было неожиданным, с высадки космо-десантников ""Караул Смерти""! ГДЕ УЛЬТРАМАРИНЫ?!
И только когда наш космодес снял шлем, все стало на свои места :)

Передать восторг от мясной нарезки тиранидов просто невозможно! Особенно если играть на джостике от PS5, чувствовать сопротивление курков с каждым выстрелом, вибрацию при беге на каждый шаг добавляет ощущения тяжести космодеса, мощи болтера!





Когда в начале игры тебе показывают рой тиранидов бегущий, где то там в далеке, то тебя это не сильно беспокоит, это же фон, ведь так? Ведь так?!
Но по мере приближения этой огромной толпы, ты понимаешь, что это не фон, что это не статичные болванчики, это реально огромная толпа врагов, которую тебе нужно выкосить в одиночку! И их не остановят высокие стены, они как те зомби из фильма с Бредом Петровичем , эти ксеносы просто построят живую лестницу и придут за тобой!





За первые часы я умирал не единожды, но это не отпугнуло меня пересесть на более легкую сложность, наоборот, экшен настолько задорный, кровавый, брутальный, что хочется хардкора!
Боёвка не сильно сложна: есть цепной меч или нож для ближнего боя, есть болт-пистолет и полноценный болтер, и конечно есть уворот и парирование.
Тактика боя:
Пока враг далеко, стреляем с Болтера.
Когда близко, бъем мечом, парируем, восстанавливаем HP.
Добиваниями восстанавливаем броню.

К слову парирования убивает мелочь сразу, а более серьезного противника на мгновение , для нашей атаки цепным мечом. Вот добивания крупной дичи особенно кровавы! То космодес оторвет клешню тираниду и засунет ему под ребро, то вырвет позвоночник, то растопчет голову...брр...жесть!





Графика тут неплоха, именно что не плоха, не идеальна. Как по мне, графика, могла быть и лучше, но это моё мнение.
Да тут много графических мелочей, кровь стекает по броне и плащу ГГ, грязь цепляется на сапоги брони и разлетается в стороны от громовой поступи, взрывы, достаточно детализированы элементы брони.
НО! На первой же планете, цветокор такой странный выцвевше серый.... Когда заходишь в здания, яркость цветов возвращается. Не знаю, мож я что не так накрутил в яркости )

На моём не топовом ведре , игра идет с просадками до 70 фпс на максимальных настройках (за исключением размытия в движении, отключил нафиг).

На момент написания подключиться к серверам, тот еще квест. Потому компанию прохожу в офлайн режиме. Но как только игра стартанёт для стандарт издания буду проходить (или может уже перепроходить) компанию с другом.

PVP режим пока не смотрел, возможно дополню обзор позже.





Я взял ультра издание и не пожалел!
Игра стоит своих денег, комон ребята, это же ВАХА!
Красивая картинка с достойной оптимизацией.

Evrenin karanlık atmosferi, oyuncuyu içine çekmeyi başarıyor, görevlerin temposu ise iyi dengelenmiş. Özellikle görevlerin akışı ve anlatımdaki detaylar oyunu daha keyifli hale getiriyor, sizi sürekli ilerlemeye teşvik ediyor.

Oynanış kısmında yakın ve uzak dövüş mekanikleri dengeli tasarlanmış olsa da, bazen yakın dövüşe zorlanmak stratejik özgürlüğü kısıtlayabiliyor. Düşmanların hızları nedeniyle mesafe açmak zorlaştığında, istemeseniz bile kendinizi sürekli yakın dövüşte buluyorsunuz. Bu da farklı oynanış tarzlarını tercih edenler için sınırlayıcı olabilir.

İçerik açısından ise görev sayısının biraz sınırlı olduğunu söylemek mümkün. Daha fazla çeşitlilik ve görev eklenmesi oyunun uzun vadede tekrar oynanabilirliğini artıracaktır. Ayrıca, silah çeşitliliği de daha fazla olabilirdi, çünkü mevcut silahların bazıları birbirine oldukça benziyor. Yine de, oyun mevcut haliyle keyifli bir deneyim sunuyor ve ilerleyen güncellemelerle eksiklerin giderileceğini umuyorum.

Henüz PvP modunu ve multiplayer görevlerini deneme fırsatım olmadı, ancak oyunun genel kalitesini göz önüne alırsak bu modların da tatmin edici olacağını düşünüyorum. Oyunun aksiyon dolu yapısı ve farklı sınıflar sayesinde bu modların da eğlenceli ve rekabetçi olacağına inanıyorum.

Warum die Tyraniden ende MidGame als Gegner verschwinden erschließt sich mir ebenfalls nicht. Sie haben schließlich ne Invasion gestartet. Der Schwarmverstand interessiert nur das er neue Materie bekommt, von wem oder was is dem egal.

🐒Monke🐒,1,64.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MasqueicoMonke/,"Primeiro e antes de mais nada, talvez essa análise seja enviesada pelo simples fato de eu curtir o universo de W40K já tem bastante tempo, mas vamos lá pras perguntas mais simples (o que normalmente a pessoa quer saber quando vem ler ssasporcaria):

O jogo é bom? Sim.

O jogo tá pesado? Tá.

Vale a pena comprar? Se tu tá com o dinheiro e não vai gastar com coisas mais importantes, com certeza.

Tem bastante customização mesmo? Tem, só que eu achei de certa forma limitada em relação a algumas coisas (por exemplo querer pintar determinada parte da power armor mas não poder por que ficou bem ""generalizada"" a colorização), além, de é claro, terem colocado basicamente todas as customizações como ""compráveis"" com pontos que você ganha quando joga missões no modo de operations, outra coisa, um negócio que achei de certa forma ""paia"" foi o fato de que não vai dar pra pintar as armaduras de campeão dos capítulos (no caso só tem dos ultramarines até agora mas muito provavelmente vai valer pras que lançarem no futuro também).

Qual versão vale mais a pena pegar? Cara, depende de se tu curte a franquia ou não, a season pass que é dada na Gold será mais pra pegar novas customizações do que qualquer outra coisa, se for pegar a ultra só pegue se tu pensa que jogar com uma minigun (ou algum outro trabuco pesado) estilo o Heavy do TF2 é legal/divertido (A classe tá legal mas eu prefiro jogar full melee), EU recomendaria pegar a standard se caso tu não for alguém que já curta o universo/temática de W40K.

Dá pra jogar solo ou é obrigatório ter amigo pra jogar junto? Bicho, dá pra jogar solo, o bot é meio burro mas ele ajuda. O jogo pra jogar com os amigos é muito bom, e, se caso você quiser jogar o modo ""Operations"" que é o modo PvE do jogo (fora a campanha), o matchmaking é bem rápido, sem contar também que tem o modo PvP que tem bastante gente jogando no momento.

Tem bastante variedade de arma? Mais ou menos. Atualmente existem as ""figurinhas carimbadas"" da franquia, algumas delas ficam meio que de escanteio por existirem armas mais fortes (meio que não são tão balanceadas), no futuro, pelo que falaram e pelo roadmap, serão adicionadas novas armas, então, é só aguardar.

A campanha é muito longa? Cara, pelo que eu vi, não tanto, é papo de 20 horas ao que parece (isso com você tomando seu tempo e jogando na calma), apesar disso, pelo que joguei, curti o rumo da história e a progressão. O que vai dar longevidade ao jogo é mais o modo PvE e o PvP.


(Só um adendo, como falei, o jogo tá bem pesado, além disso, aparentemente tem alguns bugs como por exemplo inimigos invisíveis e/ou o seu personagem também invisível, pessoalmente não presenciei nenhum bug até agora, jogo tá rodando de boas (apesar que meu PC tá uma porqueira pra rodar o jogo))

好了，打完剧情进行动模式才意识到那些幽默爆弹枪全部都是用来搞笑的原P玩具，整个游戏就两把枪能用，分别是热熔和多管热熔，而不能带热熔的原P全部都被溺死在了巢都下水道的屎水里，这就是原P武器库给我的自信，基利曼！哆啦考尔！我的弹药在哪里？！我爆燃枪呢？我重力炮呢？

CSM更是重量级，看到屏幕上出现一波敌人的下一秒拐角走出来两个圣甲虫终结者加一个巫师与此同时背后刷出来了三个红字战士我就直接鼠标一丢等死了。
除了明砍回击系近战判定之外，还暗砍了翻滚的距离和无敌时间，最让我觉得莫名其妙的改动是他把毒液炮的瞄准蓄力时间给随机化了，从以前可以按照时间预判来翻滚变成了只能盯着那条瞄准线激情目押，按歪来就瞬间失去半条血，真实还原面对现代桑吉尔夫而你是个只能搓升龙的脆皮的游戏体验。
这也就算了，加了一个从暗潮抄过来的兄弟情系统，战斗兄弟必须互相靠近才能回甲！而我翻遍了10版codex没看到哪里有写超雄战士身边没有战斗兄弟的时候就不能过甲保，上面只写了军刀的妈已经永远地迷失在了亚空间。你作为一个牢锤，你看到一群怪朝你扑过来你能忍住不跳起来砸地板的话你定力已经超越90%的青春期体育生了，而在这个难度5，你一个人飞出去的意思就是你会变成个不能回甲的废物，好吧，抛开牢锤这个废物职业不谈，如果你的队友是个需要站在后排获得射击视野或者避免队友挡炮的狙击/电浆特战的话也会遇到同样的问题，而先锋更是每次接敌都要做出抉择：是我一个人跳出去切掉后排的吞噬枪和毒液炮让自己和队友都不能回盾，还是保持战线被随机抽奖的毒液炮射爆？
超雄战士的人生抉择：在面对能够如同人生头一次看AV的青春期体育生一样能射的新版本双脑虫的AOE弹幕攻击的情况下，我到底是扎堆找机会杂兵回甲还是散开各凭本事？

Waiting for some meaningful DLCs like new enemies (necrons, orks...) and biomes(lava world, ice world, ocean world (perhaps, it may be some giant ocean facility or something) for PvE and not just new skins.

P.S.: Would be cool to see Sisters of Battle/Adepta Sororitas as playable faction with separate campaign as DLC at some point (side story + co-op multiplayer stuff).",2024/9/8,en

First of all I LOVE THIS GAME

BUTT

It has high highs and very low lows

----------WHAT I LOVE AND WOULD KISS THE DEVELOPERS FOR -------------------------------

1. World building ( I never knew what a battlebarge interior looked like and am trying to recreate one in another game so this helps a lot ) ( the little room of a marine )

2. Graphics

3. Space marine lines, interactions, roasts, voice actors - chefs kiss

4. The random interactions on the ship ( Relationship between serfs, marines, techpriests and servitors )
As a side-note, there was an interaction where a servitor reported severe spine injury and that did describe the horror of a servitor)

5. Gaunts dying from the psychic blast when a warrior dies is PERFECTION.

6. Marine movement, weapon sounds, all great

7. The way you can find random areas with weapons or dataslates.

8. Fisting flowers ( Imperial fist reference?)



----------What I hate, dislike, am confused about ( I may be wrong, I accept that, so feel free to discuss with me on this)

1. The armor colors on the customization menu are POOP. Mostly. A lot of colors are missing and some are completely different from the GW colors with the same name. Was it hard to sample bucket those colors from the GW website? AND WHY ARE THERE SO FEW?

2. The eliminator sniper seems way to weak compared to the tabletop

3. The pyroblaster flame looks terrible, range way to short

4. If a unit makes a special attack you cant react with a grenade or some other things, Titus stays there like a brain damaged guardsmen.

5. The way they made the tyrannid rippers is terrible. They are just floating 3D models that are not actually there like the rest of the units and for some reason are not affected by the psychic blast when a warrior dies.

6. The leman russes I saw never move their sponson weapons or USE THEM.

7. The game loads so slow I can take a nap in the meantime.

8. I had a heavy bolter with some rounds left, then I started fighting the LICTOR and I no longer had the weapon, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I was using that.

9. The cutscenes are premade and it does not matter what loadout you selected, it always shows one weapon. A BIT LAZY

10. The enemy variety seems poor, when you see how many units tyrannids actually have. Many of them could be bosses. ( I write this not having finished the game yet so I may eat my words later on)



----------What I wanted but did not get, maybe for now --------------------

1. Letting me play the campaign with custom colors and armor. LET ME PRETEND I AM FIGHTING WITH MY HOMEBREW ARMY. PLEASE!!!

2. Did not see a way to apply custom chapter badges ( homebrew reasons as well )


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- NEW REVIEW AFTER I FINISHED THE MAIN CAMPAIGN --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

WHAT I AM MOST DISAPPOINTED

1. The campaign is way too short, took me 2 days to finish

2. The tyrannid enemies and variety is VERY LACKING
WHAT YOU GET - Rippers, Gaunts, Warriors, Lictor, Carnifexes, spore mines, Harpy, Raveners, Zoanthropes

WHAT YOU DID NOT GET - Bio-Titans, Genestealer, Hive guards, Mawlock, Pyrovores or Biovores, Tervigones, Tyranofexes, Venomthropes

3. Sometimes the guard units just stop and wait for the player to move to the next area, like in poor designed games when the animation just finishes and nothing more happens ( more specifically the bridge section )

4. Random lore aspects that don't make sense like the tyrannids collecting corpses but there are no reclamation pools or tendrils OR having both first-born vehicle models and primaris models

5. Forcing me to use certain weapons in the latest boss battles, when I was saving some special weapons.

6. Like I said before, Leman Russ tanks not shooting their side weapons at all.

7 . The guardsmen depiction is kinda ♥♥♥♥ in regards to their equipment ( they never use mortars, heavy weapons, sentinels, hellhounds, special weapons AT ALL) ( NOT EVEN A BASILISK BOMBARDMENT )

8. No mission with a usable vehicle, just teases us ( at least implement one with an invictor suit )

9. Most of the game is filled with massive teases ( seeing a baneblade stationary BUT NEVER AFTERWARDS, NEVER IN COMBAT) ( a helldrake that suddenly becomes irrelevant )

10. The fact that I have to unlock colors that are WAY TO FEW and INNACURATE

11. The price of the game when you take into consideration all of its negative aspects


The whole game feels like a cash grab, but with some effort put into it because there are still many pozitive aspects.

If with the next patches they change some things I WILL CHANGE THE REVIEW.

I am just disappointed.",2024/9/8,en

Legendz-Senpai⚜,1,71.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Legendz_Senpai/,"I can confirm that Space Marine 2 is probably the best game in the Warhammer 40k universe ever released so far, especially in 3-player co-op, it's enjoyable and awesome.
the game is really beautiful graphically, the scenario is solid and respects the universe of warhammer 40k very well if you like the universe you will really be served. There is a pretty crazy attention to detail in the game the number of enemies that are displayed by combat is really impressive the same for the enemy and allied units in the distance that you can kill there are many different ways to play the game even if in the end it remains the same thing you have a lot of weapons in melee and at a distance. The animations are so enjoyable the cinematics are really magnificent worthy of a movie. The modus operandi is really nice and allows you to play with your own squad at the same time as the main missions of the campaign (always with 3) which allows you to explore the actions during the campaign a little more. And if you are interested in multiplayer for the moment it is really very nice worthy of the first opus of space marine and the future content that the studio plans to put really gives me good hope (new pve mission, pvp mod, horde mode, new weapons etc ...) In short to be honest I never buy games in advance and even less at 80 € to play them in advance but I must say that I am so impressed by the qualities of the game that I recommend you to play it even if you are not a hardcore fan of warhammer. Many studios should perhaps take Saber Interactive as an example to take time to refine their game (isn't that right ubisoft) then just imagine a real single player game as refined as space marine 2 in the star wars universe.

Еще отмечу, что с нынешней тенденцией выпускать игры сырыми и забагованными - эта игра выгодно отличается своей качественно проведенной работой над багами перед релизом.

Bei dem PVP Modus ist dies nicht so schlimm doch bei PVE geht die Lust leider nach den 6 Missionen schnell raus. Server Probleme gab es jedoch nicht viele. Einige haben Grafikprobleme und sehen unsichtbare Charaktere wo aber dran gearbeitet wird. Ich persönlich hätte mir gewünscht das man seinen Space Marine individueller gestalten kann z.B. das man Namen, Stimme und Gesicht ändern kann.

Der Rest an dem Spiel ist sehr positiv. Das Kampfsystem macht jedes mal Bock und auf die Grafik wäre sogar der Imperator stolz da sie sogar sehr flüssig läuft. Interface und Audio wirken sehr gut überarbeitet und besonders die deutsche syncro kann sich durch aus hören lassen. Das absolute Highlight ist meiner Meinung nach die Kampagne. An der kann ich absolut nichts kritisieren da sie viel Spaß macht und die Inszenierung mehr als gut gelungen ist.

Mehr Content ist zwar bestätigt durch die Roadmap aber ich glaube dieser wird dauern da der Content bestimmt zeitgleich mit den Konsolen raus kommt. Wenn ihr auch PVP spielt kann euch das Game sehr lange fesseln!

Дальний бой в игре ощущается кастрированным. Ближний бой гораздо практичнее, но при этом импакта от него почти никакого. Астартес будто палкой машут.

Дизайн конечно ебёт, но сильно расстроило, что опять в игре по вселенной появляется именно ересь Тризнча. В конце прошлого года уже выходила великолепная Rogue Trader, в которой тоже в основном были демоны Тзинча в основной сюжетке. Хочется в крупных играх посмотреть и на других хаоситов.

В целом я уверен, что эти разработчики еще наполнят игру множеством контента. И если игра будет интересна людям, будут её поддерживать несколько лет. Но на выходе для игры за 5к деревянных ну слишком слабо и пусто. Тот же Rogue Trader на релизе хоть и имел множество багов и сильные перекосы в балансе, но зато контента в нём было на 100+ часов. Да и стоил он сильно дешевле. Дальнобойное оружие все одинаковое по ощущениям, пользоваться чем то кроме тяжелых болтеров и мельты в целом и не хочется. Видов противников тоже крайне мало - 5 у тиранидов и 4 у хаоситов. Миссий мало, задачи на миссиях сводятся к нажиманию кнопочек на терминалах.

Еще показалось, что игре нехватает саундтрека. Не запомнилось ни одного трека, играющего на фоне. Как будто специально старались написать музыку, которая будет слегка и максимально ненавязчего приседать на ухо в момент перебежек по локациям. Но это же ваха, тут должны быть эпические оркестровые композиции. Как было в том же Rogue Trader, к слову.

С техническими проблемами не столкнулся вообще, один раз только из 20-30 сессий в операциях словил дисконнект, но больше было похоже на локальную проблему с сетью.

Если думаете покупать, но сомневаетесь - лучше подождите полгода-год. Тогда может и контента завезут, и скидки подрубят. На релизе нормально себя развлечь смогут только совсем отбитые фанаты вселенной.

Pros:
Style: The feel of the 40k universe is really hit on the head. This alone has probably gotten me through the game. I just really adore it.
Audio: Crunchy sound design is very satisfying.
Weapons: The gear you use feels pretty good, the design is limited, but it's loyal to the universe.
Gameplay: Fairly rhythmic fighting with parries, counters & dodges.
Big enemies: Boss fights can be tough ( Angel of Death difficulty ), but typically manageable ( caveat below ).
Story: The story is a bit shallow, but good enough.

Cons:
The most glaring issue is ally AI. It's horrendous, pathetically bad. This can make some boss fights an absolute slog when you're trying to balance yourself to proceed through the fight. It also destroys immersion seeing an Astartes knuckle f***ing himself in the corner while you're fighting for your life.
Hit boxes: The hit boxes are bad. You'll get hit at bizarre ranges & you'll often shoot invisible walls when attacking enemies. I've also been struck countless times through cover from ranged attacks.
Homing Melee Attacks: One the most annoying things in this game is enemies leaping at you ( not talking about parry counters ) & having them turn in the air or have them YA YEET themselves after you when you dodge.
Stun Lock: Though I understand it's a swarm hitting you & that's sort of the point, getting stun locked is just a poor choice. No one likes stun lock. No one likes losing control of their character. No one wants to have 2/3 of their health gone from 3 gaunts.

Edit:

Tacked on Feature: After finally playing the PvP I gotta' say it's pretty dog-sh*t. The fact that you have to re-level up just to use weapons is a very brain-dead decision. It's artificial play time that should not exist in a game where PvP feels like a tack-on to begin with. Being dumped into games where the majority of my team is > Level 10 & the opponents are < Level 20 is laughable.

I want to like this game, but I can't recommend it when the first game is better in every way. Saber Interactive clearly has some big fans of the franchise in their midst, but the gameplay needs a lot more time in the oven.

Visually, the game is stunning. If you're a lore enjoyer, you're in for a good time.

The gameplay is passable to bad in the best of times. They attempt to wow you with some cool swarming tech, but once the novelty wears off, you're left with a lot to be desired.

Gunplay is bland and simple while Melee is clunky and unpolished. Hitting enemies feels like hitting a sponge. Dodge and Parry prompts aren't responsive and sometimes simply wont do anything at all. You'll take 3/4 of your health in damage for failing a prompt. Better hope someone on your team is killing the ranged enemies or that failed prompt will end with you dying while your character tries to stand up.

When an enemy's health gets low enough, they're stunned and prompt you to run over and Execute them with a special animation. When executed, you'll restore armor (not health). This would be great if smaller enemies didn't die in one hit, preventing you from executing them for armor. Don't forget that you're getting hit for a majority of your health, so, good luck! Sometimes it feels like it's is more efficient to recover health/armor by dying and letting your AI companions resurrect you. The overall flow of battle feels terrible when you're supposed to be a walking tank.

If you want to feel like a Space Marine, play the first game again.",2024/9/7,en
PUFF,1,78.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yanDeiya123/,"游戏评价目前推荐：针对锤粉和对艺术有兴趣的玩家。
甚至完全不如暗潮爽。
有几个非常大的问题希望你们9号游玩前知道。
1.枪反无法打断指令，而且不完全无敌，高难度下高血精英无法直接接处决，所以还是推荐近战处决。
2.奸奇在有些图是有bug的，上个场景（上个阶段）中未击杀的巫师会跨图复活千子，导致游戏几乎无法进行。
3.格挡有两段，二段是一个推击，但是推击是没有格挡的，以及格挡本身性能不强，无法支持混潮或者复数精英时的情况。
4.指令除了能被处决和格挡打断外，翻滚无法打断，也就是说你要翻滚必须结束上一次动作。导致雷霆锤这样动作帧很大的武器受苦。
5.这游戏目前没有奶妈，战斗回血比较严苛，有以下三种情况，一是盾卫在你旁边开大你立即接处决，二是守护道路复活后立即接处决，三是受伤后虚血立即处决。所以满盾该放给队友处就给队友。
6.高难远程生存能力不足，很难在清周围杂和处理精英得到平衡。目前两个主远程都有问题，主要体现在处理精英过慢，和没有队友很难处理利卡特和蛇虫。
7.机制方面，盾的作用其实是衔接，有盾-清杂/打伤-没盾-处决循环 保持战斗节奏用的，但一旦被远程近战黏上盾分钟没有的。
欢迎补充，PS. 对远程伤害真的很失望。",2024/9/8,zh-cn

This latest installment in the Warhammer 40K universe sets a new standard for action-packed shooters with its impeccable blend of brutal melee combat, strategic gunplay, and stunning visuals. Saber Interactive really came through with this installment. It is a game that long time fans of Warhammer 40k truly have been asking for.

From the moment you step into the power armor of a Space Marine, the game impresses with its attention to detail. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking paired with a bombastic audio design, Space Marine 2 showcases the grimdark universe with a level of realism that immerses you completely. The environments are richly detailed, from the war-torn landscapes to the imposing architecture of the Imperium’s strongholds.

The combat is where Space Marine 2 truly shines. The gameplay feels both fluid and weighty, with a seamless transition between hand-to-hand combat and ranged weaponry. The abilities and upgrades add depth and variety, ensuring that each encounter remains fresh and exhilarating. The game’s AI is notably sharp, presenting a formidable challenge that keeps you on your toes without ever feeling unfair.

In summary, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a masterclass in combining thrilling gameplay with a deep, immersive world.

Craftless Rogue,1,12.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Revendawn/,"My Dearest Martha,

I write this letter having been beset by Tyranid scum and Chaos villainy. I have finished the main campaign with my AI brothers and there is much to say.

They say war is hell and while that is true here it is a very pretty hell. The sights and sounds of battle are massive in scale and in quality. Watching enemies explode into bloody bits or some magical dust ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was always satisfying. While most of my time was spent with two other squad mates there was always a feeling of a larger campaign at play. Sometimes from background battles raging, but also in those moments when you are charging forward alongside a massive army.

The spectacle is really incredible and I found, in general, the combat to be fun. Guns felt like that had impact and ""oomph"" melee weapons had weight. It felt good to run around, see the sights, and fight. All the pieces make for an extremely compelling experience that I couldn't walk away from, even if occasional issues would cause the odd rage-quit.

So let's talk about the bad stuff, because this has not been all roses. For every time you get a jump pack and the game gets 100x more fun there are a few things and missions that bring the overall experience down.

First off - this game is clearly a multiplayer/COOP game first. The AI squad is awful. They get the most important part right, which is trying to revive you if you go down, but beyond that they are poor in combat, and almost non-existent when it comes to objectives or tactics. Now it's okay to make a game where you want COOP as a focus, but if you are going to advertise and push that it's a solo game too you do need to properly support that experience and I think the game falls incredibly short in this key area.

In fact I think that if you had a better, more effective, and/or commandable squad the other issues I have might not matter. I also felt that for a giant armored Space Marine I felt like dolled up tissue paper. The game asks a lot in terms of special blocks, regular blocks, special dodges, regular dodges, pistol counters, executions, ranged fighting, and melee swarms all at once, but gives very little health and armor to support all of that even on the baseline difficulties. It doesn't make the game impossible by any means, but it does make it a little less fun.

Still I can't help but think that much of this is less of an issue if my squad was doing a better job of not making me fight everything mostly alone possibly while juggling objectives and in one really bad stage while also using a flamethrower to keep swarms at bay.

While I've focused on issues a bit I think overall my net experience with the game is far more better moments than troubled ones. There was only one stage I hated (the swarm bunker thing) and a few objectives that made me long for less brain-dead brothers at my side. It didn't prevent me from completing the campaign over a few days because I couldn't stop playing. They are also all issues that can be fixed.

So often we see games come out with problems way beyond the scope of a patch, but in the case of Space Marine 2 I don't think there is anything that couldn't be improved down the line. Hopefully they actually make some of these improvements, because I think this game could be damn-near perfect if they did.

Also as these issues are almost all tied to the single player experience, if you are playing online or with friends I think realistically you are just going to have a much better time. So it's an easy recommend to online/COOP players and while I still recommend it to solo player I do warn that there are some pain points, especially on higher difficulties from your AI companions.

At a time where my gaming has been an hour here, an hour there, try this, try that, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 became my world for a few days. Despite the blood and carnage of it all it was a glorious focus and a stellar time.

Para personas normales, el juego se ve muy bien gráficamente, lo peor son los personajes, que se ven bien, pero no llega al fótorealismo de los escenarios, en cuanto a rendimiento, no lo estoy jugando a todo en alto/ultra menos las texturas, porque me pide más de 8 Gb de Ram de vídeo para poder usar textura en ultra. Yo he usado DLSS y obtengo una media de frames sobre los 60 a 2K, lo cual me parece muy bien optimizado, y no suele caer cuando llevan cientos de enemigos en pantalla. A mi me resulta muy familiar este juego con World War Z, en cuanto a mecánicas y dificultad, para mi no es un juego fácil, al igual que WWZ necesitas mejorar mucho tu equipo para poder sobrevivir a las oleadas, pero acaba de salir y todo esto estará sujeto a cambios. En un buen juego, para relajarte unas horas al día, masacrando enemigos de manera brutal, pero si quieres estar muchas horas enganchado, en mi caso me cansa, es decir, perfecto para jugar unas horas al día, pero a partir de 2 o 3 horas, puede hacerse pesado ese día, pero al día siguiente lo vuelves a disfrutar como un niño. Pese a la campaña, y los modos de juego PVE es necesario estar online para subir experiencia, si juegas offline, pues no avanzas, y en PVP evidentemente online siempre, ahora mismo el juego lo veo algo falto de contenido, supuestamente con el roadmap, van a seguir sacando nuevo contenido, pero hoy por hoy, para mi, lo veo escaso, el juego consiste en repetir y repetir hasta conseguir las mejores puntuaciones, tiempos y con la mayor dificultad.

Para fans de Warhammer, con todas las opciones de personalización en cuanto esquema de colores, adornos, insignias, te pasaras horas diseñando tu marine espacial preferido, tu propio capitulo e incluso si le echas imaginación tu propio personaje. Y en el modo foto, es como si tuvieras su partida de mesa de Warhammer en tu pantalla, todo el ambiente te lleva al loco y distópico futuro de W40K.

En resumen, el juego esta divertido, el contenido cosmético extra solo lo veo necesario si eres un fan aférrimo del W40K y te puedes permitir la burrada que vale cada tontería. Para una persona que no conoce W40K, puede parecerle caro o poco contenido, y que hay otros juegos mejores, para gustos los colores, solo espero haberte ayudado con esta reseña. De todos motos si no lo tienes claro, espera a la demo o ve vídeos de gameplay en youtube o streaming, ahora una cosa, el codec de vídeo no le hace justicia a como se ve el juego en tu pantalla.

NOTA: El juego usa servidores para el progreso y modos multijugador, pero según roadmap, se podrá crear un servidor privado y offline, y deberías subir experiencia, o al menos en modo offline como ocurre WWZ (esto esta en el aire, veremos a ver como lo hacen al final), se puede jugar perfectamente sin conexión a Internet en modo desconectado, o simplemente sin conexión a Internet.

Saber nailed it: the setting is perfectly captured in all possible ways, the lore respected and made alive and the gameplay is just fantastic.
It was the game i was expecting since i've finished Space Marine 13 years ago and i'm playing it with the same friends (i mean BATTLE BRATHAS) i used to play SM1 and actual Warhammer tabletop games back in the days.
I cannot recommend this game enough.

The Bloodiest Magpie,1,52.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019816127/,"Space Marine 2 is a long-awaited, much-hoped-for sequel to the first Space Marine game. You play as <REDACTED> (jk it's freaking Titus like that wasn't obvious enough) who starts off using Primaris-styled equipment as a regular first-born marine. Hmm. Can't say that's particularly lore accurate, but whatever, it's Titus so that's cool. Unfortunately he's no Mark Strong this time, can't blame him after everything that happened. Be aware.

I tried playing the campaign missions on Angel of Death difficulty. This will color my breakdown below.

The 'nids are, as expected, annoying ass space bugs that swarm you faster than skaven do at a Warpstone rave party, and they're fairly dangerous. In fact, each of them individually might not seem like a problem but start throwing in 3 or so hormagaunts and you'll start having more stab wounds than a mugging victim in London. The termagaunts, those little annoying freaking shooty bugs, appear to not wield regular fleshborers, since the damn things flash green like miniature rapid-fire venom cannons. If you don't know what a venom cannon is, I'll explain it further down below in the Warrior section.

All of these swarm mechanics overwhelming you through sheer numbers is really pronounced. I started having to take engagements carefully and seriously right from the get-go. You can't regenerate any health from simple executions this time either, you need to have taken damage recently (a la Bloodborne) and this makes Titus not only feel like tissue paper, but unable to recover easily. You need to use the medical stims and those are far and few in between, so they definitely took the 'its too easy' critique about the first game too much to heart. Titus will find these enemies dangerous and annoying in equal measure as a result, so don't go thinking you can charge into the jaws of hell and not get tarpitted harder than Abbadon facing a 50 block of guardsmen backed up by a Commissar Lord. They are just as fearless as said guardsmen and unlike Abbadon, Titus can't ♥♥♥♥ out like 10 attacks in a single round of combat, so you better hope you're good at parrying.

Note that while parrying or dodging or attacking, you are more or less animation locked. You can't cancel easily, and this honestly makes you feel a lot more sluggish than Captain Titus, who is now obviously the best version of Titus there was. This means you have to thin their numbers at range, hopefully reducing the 'gaunt variants down to less than 3 by the time the Warrior rushes you down.

Let's talk about Warriors. Warriors are the big 'nids that have that annoying ass whip, that annoying ass paired boneswords, that really annoying ass devourer, or that annoying ass venom cannon (that long snout thing).
The Whip is not too bad in a 1 on 1, just make sure to either stay clear of it while wiping out the small forms or...dunno, charge in and beat it to death before it can get really annoying. When it does that lash combo attack, it's very hard to parry so you're better off just trying to keep your distance and shooting it down.
The twin boneswords is just tanky. That's it.
The devourer is basically a rapid-fire fleshborer, and the Warrior who uses it is the most irritating PoS you will ever encounter. It will constantly skate away to the backline to pepper you with clusters of projectiles and it adds up a lot of damage very fast. Snipe this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as soon as possible. If you try to close in melee, it will sometimes unload every shot into you at point-blank range and you can die from this.
The last one, the venom cannon wielder, is the sniper variant. A venom cannon is like a biological railgun except instead of shooting a metal projectile it shoots this venomous acidic crystal that is superheated by the electrical discharge (yes, this is how it works in lore) and is launched at high speed to penetrate vehicles...or something. It didn't really work against real vehicles, but it definitely works against MEQ (shorthand for 'marine equivalent') like Titus. You will get a warning in the form of a sickly green laser tracking you and you can dodge the shot quite easily with good timing. The real problem is when one of them shows up and you are fighting a swarm or two and their Warrior melee cousins all at the same time, which is when things get nasty. Even then, its particular attacks are not hard to avoid, so either trust in your mobility or kill them off first, your choice.

There's more bug variants and their stupid tactics but I'm tired of talking about bugs so let's talk about weapons.

Gunplay and melee aren't mutually exclusive, it retains the general fluidity of the first game and you can swap between the two styles of combat very fast. Pistols are actually useful, they take their own slot and can help offset some disadvantages of your primary, while also serving as a way to perform kill shots on parried enemies.

Bolters. Holy Emperor the bolters. There are so many bolter variants, and some of them being very cross purposes with their actual function to the point it makes you wonder who needs this many variants. They are all lifted from the Primaris arsenal, and you get the whole freaking line of them (except Assault Bolters). Bolt carbines, heavy bolt pistols, auto bolt rifles, you name it they have it. In fact, I would argue that there are simply too many bolters. In the first game most of the same roles were replicated by unique weapons, such as the plasma gun, the lascannon, the vengeance launcher, and so on. Now you get...bolters.

Some of them are effective and some are not, but all of them are only average on Angel of Death difficulty so I didn't really find them to be that unique. What stood out were the non-bolter weapons, the Plasma Incinerator and the Melta Rifle.
The Plasma Incinerator is like a cross between the regular plasma gun and a very small plasma cannon, and it performs well enough in that role. It's plasma and it hurts.
The Melta Rifle is basically just like the melta gun from the first game. Tight AOE cone that does more damage the closer to the center of the aiming circle you get, huge shotgun blast that can melt anything.
There's some other stuff like the Las Fusil, which is basically just a lascannon if they scaled it down and in-game it's basically a Charge Rifle from Titanfall. It's still a good weapon, but they clearly learned their lesson from the first game where the lascannon's instant shot could utterly destroy an unfortunate enemy's face at close range.

Melee weapons unfortunately all feel a little samey. The chainsword is effective but it only swings in tight arcs and relies on a charge attack combo to stun enemies, which is extremely awkward compared to the first game where your stun/charge attack was another key altogether. This means it is very easy to start a chainsword combo then get hit for your trouble because you have no way of interrupting your enemy.
The power sword is a little more forgiving as it has actual stances that emphasize AOE or single target combat. It still has the issue of not being able to stagger big creatures reliably, or having a charge attack combo that matters, but it is reliable enough with its large sweeping attacks to actually outperform the chainsword on a regular basis.
The thunder hammer took a big hit from last game. It is just as sluggish and slow despite Titus' better augmentations, but is weaker. You can put a lot of hurt on enemies, but you have too many gaps open that leave you unable to defend yourself properly. Compare that to the first game, where the hammer's instant-kill damage and reliable stun combo can AOE wipe out hordes of daemons or whatever. It's very weak in this game.
The power fist staggers most enemies. Good enough.

关卡设计又贼恶心，最难的反而是前几关，虫子的肉搏能力和远程能力都很强，近战有武士虫和刀虫海，远程还有枪虫海和枪武士虫，几个有脑虫的战点在最高难度下都是能让你死去活来的，主武器是热熔你就没办法处理脑虫和远程，但是不拿热熔你就没办法处理几个武士虫带刀虫海，只能说战役可能就是为了合作设计的，单人打AI队友基本上只能靠他们补刀不能期待他们优先击杀重要怪物，所以联机的话体验可能会好0.5分以上。

Hart,0,30.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994056144/,"Very pretty, but if you're looking for interesting gameplay, look elsewhere.

The environments are very well designed and the graphics engine does an admirable job of bringing large hordes of enemies to life. The art team clearly loved this game and the wealth of visual inspiration found in the 40k universe makes for an environment that's consistently grimdark and occasionally breathtaking despite the dark, oppressive story beats.

However, the gameplay is too basic to remain entertaining for long. Melee is a one-button affair with a push-X-to-parry system that wants to draw comparisons to Arkham Knights but feels more like a ""push X to not die"" scene from a mid-2000s action game. You do not dictate the pace of combat and any aggression on your part is immediately punished with chip damage from ranged fire and minor foes on your flanks. That chip damage swiftly mounts into fatalities. You -must- parry and retaliate, exploiting the invulnerability allowed by the retaliation and execution animations to restore your armor, slowly wearing down swarms of foes at a pace that is simply out of character for Space Marines.

Guns are inaccurate unless you're aiming down sights, ammunition is sharply limited, and anything worth shooting is also either resilient enough to shrug off ranged fire or capable of blocking sniper rounds with a sword. If an ally engages an enemy you can pop off a few head shots to knock it into execution range, but for the most part you're better off wading into the melee horde yourself and tediously retaliating your way to victory.

The visual character customization is beautiful but harshly restricted and/or greedily monetized, the equipment specialization and character growth are slow and ineffectual until you get one of a the handful of major abilities scattered throughout a 25 level grind. Relics and other equipment make more of a difference visually than in combat effectiveness - an additional 10% damage doesn't take you from 6 heavy attacks to 5 to stun a warrior, but the max rank sword sure does look a little prettier than the starter sword.

To cap that all off, in multiplayer every player has to play as a different class - but you can't select your class and then queue into a team where you're not competing for that class spot. There's about a 1 in 3 chance that someone has already selected the class you want to play when you join a team, and you can't progress your class if you can't play it, so expect to have to leave and re-queue, sometimes multiple times in a row, in order to play a preferred class in multiplayer.

The final nail in the coffin, then, is that despite the shallowness of the gameplay and the general jank of the multiplayer system, this game is terribly short, confusingly lacking in content despite having so little depth. There are only six campaign missions, which have no replayability. The only other option for PvE are operations, but again, there are only six operations. This is a full-priced $60 game that you could finish in a day, that nonetheless expects you to grind out 48 mission completions with each class to unlock visual armor.",2024/9/7,en

IF YOU SUFFER FROM MOTION SICKNESS THIS MIGHT NOT BE YOUR GAME.
if you DO NOT suffer from motion sickness then this game is metal af. buy it lol.

the narrow fov with no adjustability is the only deal breaking issue i have with the game. i dont wanna give the game a bad review because the other aspects of the game are great, BUT its basically unplayable for me.
i can only play for about 2 hours on my desktop setup before i had stop because i was becoming physically ill.

However playing on my htpc setup with a 50” tv several feet away is tolerable.

in 2024, an fov slider is a basic QOL option for most people and for some (like me) is a legit accessibility option that makes the game playable.
not having an fov slider is like not having subtitles for the hearing impaired.

IF an fov slider is added i will update my review to positive cause the rest of the game is alot of fun

NOTE: im aware that there are fov fixes/mods but i shouldn't need to jump through hoops to enjoy the game.",2024/9/10,en
Captain_Chronic611,1,36.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049022870/,"Incredible game, 9/10 cannot recommend enough.

It would be a 10/10 Emperor mandated purchase but there were a few gamebreaking bugs that me and my friend encountered during our playthrough that made us have to restart several times.

The pvp is skill based and requires you to move as a unit like OG halo multiplayer and the movement feels a lot like gears of war minus the cover to cover aspect of moving in that game.

The Campaign immediately entered my top 5 best campaigns along with Halo and Last of Us. The final missions is pure unfiltered fan service and I couldn't get enough of it.

The Scenarios are also awesome and provide a good bit of replay-ability with the perks and cosmetic unlocks and each class feels powerful in their own right.

One of my personal favorite things in this game has to be NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS!!!

The Bulldozer,1,20.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198372793657/,"I really hate to do this so early on, but out of my alleged 2 hours of ""playtime"", only 20-30 minutes has actually been in control of a Space Marine. I'm not joking when I say I've simply started scrolling through twitter and watching whole YouTube videos whilst waiting for things to load, and it also turns out that despite having downloaded the game for no less than 4 hours, I am SOMEHOW missing some ""Epic Games Multiplayer Files"". For some reason, loading into the Campaign requires connecting to a server, and basically every single cut-scene has either frozen itself partway through, has had such delayed audio that it's genuinely confusing as to who's saying what unless you have Subtitles on, or flat out just crashes the game. That half an hour I've actually been able to play the game was fun, I admit, but that simply does NOT excuse how everything outside of the gameplay seems to have been handled.

Oh, and on a separate note, a friend of mine from the UK wanted me to gift this for them when it released today and I couldn't due to ""Regional Price differences"". Turns out that people in the UK are paying what is effectively an extra $12 in USD for this game compared to Americans, so please do note that if you are from that region across the big pond.

Meu GOTY de 2024

Jogo de homem, testosterona pura, feito para quem é fã de Warhammer. Vai tirar lágrimas dos teus olhos, finalmente chegamos no AAA e merecemos esse lugar.

Combate rápido e responsivo, gore à mostra, te dá um feeling de ser um Super Soldado. Se você quer o aspecto de power fantasy, jogue no mais fácil, porque nas duas últimas dificuldades o Titus é feito de papel, e você tem que ser inteligente e ver o combate como algo mais tático.

As armas de combate corpo a corpo são extremamente fortes, o que faz com que os vários bolters do jogo sejam armas de suporte. O Martelo é a última arma de combate corpo a corpo a ser desbloqueada e é fantástica para lidar com qualquer inimigo, até mesmo os chefões que estarão no seu caminho. Como era no primeiro jogo, carregar uma arma de dano alto, como uma sniper, e o martelão pro resto.

Diferente do primeiro jogo, a ""Rage"" do Titus não te ajuda muito, pelo menos nas dificuldades mais altas. Usar a Rage no meio de um monte de inimigos não vai te curar nada, você tem que ter visão de quando usá-la para poder encher sua barra de vida. O jogo conta com dois sistemas de vida: o HP, que só pode ser curado com a Rage e os Medpacks espalhados pelo mapa (no máximo, você vai achar 4 por nível, e eles nem recuperam a vida toda, recuperam cerca de 40% da sua vida total), e a Armadura, que vai ser sua real vida, sendo recuperada com o tempo ou com execuções nos inimigos. Raramente você vai executar um inimigo fraco, isso se reserva aos Elites. O jogo se torna um samba onde você mata centenas de mobs básicos enquanto foca em colocar o elite em um estado de execução para se manter vivo dentro do combate.

Posicionamento é mestre tanto contra os quanto contra os , mas as hordas insetoides oferecem um desafio muito maior do que os . Esses insetos malditos vão te cercar tanto de perto quanto de longe, com granadas que obstruem seu caminho e pragas que vão deixar sua visão turva. Já os feiticeiros são mestres em combate de longo alcance, mas os Marines não são tão perigosos quanto os cultistas com rifles snipers, que juntos destroem sua vida e me colocaram no chão várias vezes.

Cutscenes lindas, história básica, mas que invoca tudo o que Warhammer representa com os Ultramarines, Anjos do Império do Homem, que chegam na hora em que o Império mais precisa para salvar o dia.

Mesmo eu não sendo fã dos Ultramarines, , eu gostei muito da caracterização deles. Parabéns à Saber.",2024/9/8,pt

Space Marine 2 เกมภาคต่อที่หายไปอย่างยาวนาน นานถึง 12 - 13 ปี เป็นแนว Action TPS Shooting ตะลุยเดินหน้ายิงแหลกกับเหล่าศัตรูเป็นพันๆ เป็น หมื่นๆ โดยที่ตัวเกมในภาคนี้ก็ได้เห็นการกลับมาของ Captain Demetrian Titus ที่เป็น Space Marien แห่ง Legion Ultramarien ที่มี Primarch เป็น Roboute Guilliman อีกครั้งหนึ่ง จากที่เขาหายไปอย่างยาวนาน แต่การกลับมาในครั้งนี้เขาจะโดนลดยศลงกลายเป้น Lieutenant ซึ่งมีตำแหน่งยศรองมาจาก Captain อีกทีหนึ่ง ในภาคนี้เขาก็ยังเป็นผู้ที่ได้เป็นผู้นำทีม Squad ใหม่ ที่ Captain คนใหม่ ที่ชื่อว่า Acheran ได้จัดตั้งให้ ซึ่งสมาชิกประกอบไปด้วย Gadriel ตำแหน่ง Sergeant (ผู้นำทีม Squad ก่อนที่ Titus จะมา) , Chairon , Lyreo , Altareus , Elion 4 คนนี้ ตำแหน่ง Battle-Brother ซึ่ง Titus ได้เข้าไปทำภารกิจ , ร่วมต่อสู้พร้อมเหล่าทหาร Imperial Guard สู้กับเหล่าศัตรู Xenos อย่าง พวก Tyranid เพื่อช่วยเหลือเหล่าผู้คนและดวงดาว

ตัวเกมในภาคนี้มีอยู่ 3 Mode หลักๆ คือ Campaign Story , Operation , Eternal War

Visually beautiful game, fun gameplay, good amount of variety in classes, few bugs, lots of re-playability, Co-Op PvP and PvE, beloved lore and well loved franchise.


Long Version:

Space Marines 2 is a sci-fi and gothic dark fantasy with biblical motifs that make Warhammer 40k awesome. The sheer and immense sense of scale, both indoors and outdoors perfectly capture the depth of the world that is Warhammer.

You can feel the immense love for the lore and source material, it's definitely made by fans who genuinely care about this world that is imbued through the visuals and attention to detail in every facet and asset.

This is every Warhammer 40k fan's wet dream.


Pros:
• Impressive visuals with lore-accurate art direction. The brutality and bleakness of the 40K universe are masterfully conveyed
• Superb combat system that equally rewards skill, resource conservation and a tactical, team-oriented approach. Very easy to pick up and get better. Pacing is done very well
• Solid variety of enemies, all of which have unique behaviors, movesets and abilities
• Bosses that evolve their movesets dynamically, and are highly challenging on the harder settings
• The 40K lore is accurately transposed and faithful to the series canon
• Enjoyable, well-written storyline, compounded by plausible characters and interesting events
• Exploration and Customization are rewarded
• DLC's are purely cosmetic, all future content is already planned ahead of time and content is free


Cons:
• AI companions aren’t smart enough for complex objectives, and can’t be ordered around or customized
• Balancing issues make some weapons redundant or useless
• Tabbing out of the game at any point causes the game to freeze, and I'm rocking a pretty solid set up



Writing/Lore/Worldbuilding

“In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war”. A historical quote that single-handedly resumes the bleak, brutal universe of 40K; Humanity spans the stars, its society on the verge of collapse and only carried by a fanatically-rooted war economy. SM1’s protagonist, Titus, returns as the main character and is sent on a mission to defend the Imperium; this time around, insect-like Tyranids and the Ruinous Powers of Chaos.

The tale of Titus and his two Ultramarine companions is lore-accurate and engaging — 40K fans will catch many references and bits a newcomer wouldn’t, but that doesn’t make it un-enjoyable if you’re new to the franchise. Characters aren’t one-sided and have solid narrative depth; the feeling of being an important cog of the Imperial war machine — but a cog nonetheless — is conveyed perfectly, as it should be.

Visually and artistically, few games can equal the desolate beauty the game has to offer. From the enormous Tyranid swarms laying waste to all, to the iridescent distortions of Warp powers and the blasts of Cadian artillery, everything looks and sounds amazingly crisp. Settings are varied and rich in detail, with more than a few impressive landscapes. Weapon sounds, dense effects and excellent voice acting only give further emphasis to the action-packed battles you’ll engage in. The gory finisher animations, different based on the enemy faced and weapon used, add great emphasis to the destruction of tougher foes.


Exploration & Secrets

Maps are linear, with one path to follow once either all foes are slain, or certain objectives are completed. Still, exploring the few side-areas, nothing more than crevices or branching dead-ended paths, is worth your time. There, you’ll find precious supplies and uncommon weapons that will improve your survival chances: medkits, Relics allowing you to revive once, heavy weapons and ammunition caches. Lore-related Dataslates also can be listened to in order to better understand the events that transpired. There are no collectibles or proper secrets to mention, nor a map, which you won’t need given the fairly-simple layouts and on-demand objective markers.


Operations (PVE) and Endless War (PVP)

After the Campaign, you’ll unlock several Operations: PvE missions parallel to the main story that depict critical events and feature another Ultramarine team that helped Titus in the main story. Contrary to the campaign, here you'll have access to six customizable classes, each with unique loadout capabilities and Ultimate skills, other than different passive perks and weapons to unlock as you gain XP after an Operation is cleared. Experimenting with different playstyles and combinations, and upgrading your class, adds solid replay value and good progression feeling. These Operations also have progressively increasing difficulty, with better rewards, such as cosmetics, XP bonuses and so forth, proportional to the difficulty you’ll engage into — however, you won't go far in the harder difficulties without better gear and advanced perks, despite all of the settings being available from the start regardless of level.


Content & Replay Value

Average playtime is around 16 hours to complete the game on Angel of Death (hardest) difficulty with two AI teammates, taking extra time to explore all locations thoroughly. After that, Operations and PvP modes greatly extend the content with their high replay value. The story is instead linear, and there’s no reason to replay it except achievements.

The PvP mode, Endless War, has Chaos forces face the Space Marines in a variety of objective-based modes, ranging from the classic Deathmatch and CTF to more nuanced ones. It allows full loadout customizations just as in the PvE mode, and is a nice addition for those interested in competing against other players to test their skills.



Conclusion:

Do I recommend it? Absolutely. Even if you’re not a 40K fan and just enjoy action games, this is a solid pick. Even better if you have two friends to tag along; the best experience is in co-op.

One of the best WH40K games ever made. Not only it surpasses its predecessor on all fronts, but also sets a point of reference for modern co-op-focused action titles.",2024/9/6,en

Pros;
+ Excellent atmosphere, both visually and soundwise
+ Great plotline
+ Bossfights are somewhat fun
+ Combat is enjoyable

Cons;
- Too few glory kills. It becomes dull after some time.
- Some weapons are useless
- I'd preferred Horde mode integrated from the initial release, instead of PvP. PvP does not entice me. This is a personal thing ofc

Goblin King,1,22.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005587126/,"Space Marine 2 is a game that is far, far better than Space Marine.

The entire theatre is much more ""alive"" than before, very often you will fight side by side with the guard, see wonderfully made models of tanks and listen to rousing speeches by devout soldiers of the Emperor.
The atmosphere is top notch, how everything sounds too and executes look nice again.

The campaign is very well done and fun to play, with GREAT surprises and events that are really cool.
Seeing the swarms of Tyranids on the screen is astonishing.

There is a problem with playing the campaign solo tho.
It is entirely possible to play the campaign on Veteran, solo, but for a first time playthrough i highly recommend against it.

I assume they balanced the Veteran campaign around at least 2 humans playing, which is tremendous fun for sure,
but solo quite some things are not difficult, just frustratingly stupid because the AI is very limited.
I can imagine double Zoanthropes are much less of a hassle, even on vet, with at least 2 ""real"" players.
The ranged damage received is through the roof too, which could be a numbers problem,
or because the ai has such poor target priority.

I have a Keyboard issue where my current input is being shut off randomly.
It happens when i walk/run or zoom in to aim. The character stops in his tracks / no longer zooms in until i press the button again and its making it very difficult to enjoy the game. It happens during fights, it happens when i have to walk somewhere.

Its NOT my keyboard, it works perfectly fine with other games, including Space Marine which i re-played tuesday and wednesday. Its only this game.


If you like 40k, Space Marines and good action buy this game and if you are on the fence about it, maybe wait for the first sale.

I have extreme bipolar feeling about this game.Despite the fact that the champion is short and ordinary, as a fan of Warhammer franchise I did enjoyed it greatly. As I finished the champion in 7 hour and started to play the operation mode, the game first startled me with the merely 6 map. After that, I discovered that the time needed to upgrade the character and weapons are enormous. I am wondering how Saber Interactive expects players to enjoy the operation; by repetitively farming the same map over and over for hundreds of times? Not to mention finishing one map costs about half an hour. I am not even gonna talk about the absurdity of some of the game design as many have pointed out in depth.

Einige böse Zungen würden das Spiel als einen Ausdruck toxischer Männlichkeit bezeichnen. Ich würde eher sagen, es ist genau dass, was die westliche Spiele- und Filmindustrie braucht.

Da ich bisher lediglich die Kampagne spiele, beziehe ich mich auch nur auf diese.
Space Marine 2 bietet Action und Gemetzel im Überfluss. Wer Spaß an Hack&Slay hat, wird dieses Spiel lieben.
Das Gameplay in der Kampagne ist ansprechend und herausfordernd. Die Steuerung per Maus, oder Gamepad funktioniert tadellos und es wird nie langweilig seine Feinde in wunderschöner Grafik zu zerstückeln.
Leider muss man sagen das es noch ein paar technische Mängel gibt. Zum Beispiel stürzt das Game bei mir immer ab, wenn ich es beenden möchte.
Ebenso fehlt eine manuell Speicherfunktion. Das Spiel speichert leider nur automatisch, an bestimmten Checkpoints.
Ebenso das fehlen einer 21:9 oder 32:9 Unterstützung, verhindert eine noch höhere Bewertung meinerseits.
Doch wer über diese Mängel hinwegsehen kann, bekommt ein wirklich gutes Action Game, welches richtig Laune macht.
Daher würde ich zur Zeit eine 7.5/10 geben.
Alles in allen würde ich mir mehr Spiele dieser Art wünschen. Spiele in denen der Focus auf den Spaß am Spiel liegt und nicht nur auf dem abarbeiten einer ESG Checkliste.


Some evil tongues would describe the game as an expression of toxic masculinity. I'd rather say it's exactly what the western gaming and film industry needs.

Since I've only played the campaign so far, I'll only refer to this one.
Space Marine 2 offers action and carnage in abundance. Anyone who enjoys hack & slay will love this game.
The gameplay in the campaign is engaging and challenging. The control via mouse or gamepad works perfectly and it never gets boring to dismember your enemies in beautiful graphics.
Unfortunately, it has to be said that there are still a few technical deficiencies. For example, the game always crashes for me when I want to quit it.
There is also no manual saving function. Unfortunately, the game only saves automatically at certain checkpoints.
The lack of 21:9 or 32:9 support also prevents me from giving it an even higher rating.
But if you can overlook these shortcomings, you get a really good action game that really puts you in a good mood.
Therefore I would currently give it a 7.5/10.

могу с уверенностью сказать, что см2 уже стал в разы лучше чем первая часть. низкий поклон Saber Interactive, за то что смогли сделать игру настолько высокого качества, где отлично выстроен экшн, в котором по сравнению с первой частью, добавили много элементов из прошлой игры сэйбер про зомби, и я ещё заметил что по ближнему бою есть элементы jedi fallen order. по атмосфере, звуку, эпичному появлению Тита - словил трепет. а так же игра очень красивая. выглядит так - как и должны выглядеть игры в 2024. ну и наконец - полноценный кооператив на трех человек. это достойный приемник см1, лично я залип в см2 с кайфом и залипну ещё точно. а Saber уже давно себя зарекомендовали как мастера своего дела, ибо Timeshift - игра моего детства, была ультра отпалированной. как и Will Rock, как и World War Z. поэтому если у вас будут проблемы с игрой, я уверен что их поправят. но лучше в см2 не играть если у вас нет видеокарты на 6 гб и более.

ну и вообще это пока единственный претендент на игру года. в этом году по сути кроме mullet madjack, alone in the dark, hellblade 2 и hades 2 выходили либо римейки, либо helldivers 2 который попутно в кал превратился, либо откровенный кал. единственный кто может реально составить конкуренцию Space Marine 2 - это HMRIH2 в октябре. и всё, тупо без конкурентов, ибо год вышел мега тухлым. но ладно, не ждём а готовимся.

(послерелизное)
пощупал игру полностью, прошёл на ветеране. ветеран - дисбаланс сложность, но проходимо, у меня ушло часов 8 на прохождение. в кооперативе играть плюс минус так же как и в соло, но в режиме операций кооп тащит. мультиплеер так же у игры хороший, чисто классический, без всяких приколов кроме скинов + игры идут быстро (от 5 до 15 минут). в общем кайф шутер, давно не играл в такой бодрый и превозмагающий экшн. но конечно на фоне vermintide 1-2, см мне нравится меньше, ибо не фанат 40к.

Yet even in bluds deathless state, the Skibidi continues his eternal edging.

Эзотерические машины поднимались вверх над престолом примарха, при помощи которых его нетленное тело оставалась навечно в ловушке вне времени. Жиллиман спокойно сидел на троне, с закрытыми глазами, и кровью, блестевшей на его горле словно ожерелье. Прародитель Ультрамаринов всё ещё был одет в свою старую, окровавленную и поврежденную броню, которую он носил во время последней дуэли с примархом-демоном Фулгримом. На коленях Жиллимана лежал клинок огромного размера, меч самого Императора. Хотя полубог как будто мирно спал, сила от его присутствия ощущалась неимоверно.»

Царство Ультрамар, также известное как субсектор Ультрамар — феодальная звёздная империя в составе Империума Человечества в Сегментуме Ультима. Правит здесь орден Адептус Астартес Ультрамарины, а глава этой империи — магистр ордена, носящий титул Владыки Макрагга и Владыки Ультрамара.

Отличительной особенностью субсектора является крепкая дружба между местным населением и орденами-наследниками XIII легиона. Во времена Великого Крестового похода родной мир легиона Ультрамаринов Макрагг снабжал XIII легион рекрутами и снаряжением. После окончания ужасных событий Ереси Хоруса кандидатов стали набирать со всех миров маленькой империи. Это пространство и есть Ультрамар, звёздное царство Ультрамаринов.

Ультрамарины — XIII из первоначальных двадцати легионов космодесанта. Ныне один из самых прославленных орденов Адептус Астартес.

Легион Ультрамаринов вёл войны Императора с помощью рассудительности, дисциплины и решимости; каждый воин стремился во всем подражать своему примарху. Этот самый многочисленный из всех легионов космодесанта был давним защитником владений Империума на галактическом востоке.

Замеченные стратегические предпочтения: всеобщая атака, целенаправленное истребление, планетарная блокада, операции по освобождению и приведению к покорности на ограниченном театре боевых действий.Будучи безмерно преданными своему примарху Робауту Жиллиману, Ультрамарины слепо следуют созданному им Кодекс Астартес. Десять тысяч лет они бились так, как описано на страницах этого священного писания. Другие ордены могут с лёгкостью вырвать слова Жиллимана из контекста и подстроить под себя, но только не Ультрамарины. Кодекс Астартес — труд великой мудрости, и эти воины не видят смысла перечить ей. Беспрестанные примеры самопожертвования и самодисциплины позволили жителям Ультрамара пронести священные знания и веру сквозь десять тысяч лет в будущее.

Кодекс Астартес содержит сотни страниц описания для любой мыслимой тактической ситуации на поле боя и множество вариантов решения задачи. Каждый воин ордена заучивает содержание Кодекса наизусть, так что целая рота действует как единый организм. Мудрость миллионов имперских генералов, солдат и офицеров сосредоточена на страницах Кодекс Астартес, в нём воин может найти всё: от геральдики и знаков различия, до инструкции по проведению планетарного штурма.

There are some two deal breakers that I seriously hope Saber Interactive fixes. But before we get into it, there is a fat Horus in the room that i need to address first:

Is it woke?
Short answer:
No, . Shut up about it and go cry to Arch about it. It's not an issue the game critically needs addressing at all.

Yes the spooky SBI did consulted on this game, but honestly I don't really see any detrimental influence so far. As for Ultramarines not looking 100% like a wet dream of an Austrian painter, lets be real. Anyone worth their Warhammer 30/40k salt knows that there is no canonical establishment of Ultramarines all needing to look like they came from the Austrian alps singing Sound of Music. Yes, all space marine take on features after their gene father (Rowboat Girlyman in this case), but Roboute's gene has far as lore goes is pretty stable and has few if any mutations.

All Salamanders look like Pele from SMT because Vulkan gene had a flaw that made everyone black with red eyes. Same goes for some others like Night Lords (scary emo goths) and probably Luna Wolves (bald and angry). Some, like the Raven Guard (sad emo goths) are as a result of their planet's environment (Kiavahr being terrible and Deliverance being a literal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a moon) or like White Scars (Mongolians) who not only Oct 7 his entire planet in about 20 solar years, but also recruited people exclusively from the tribe who took him in.

Some Legions (and by extension first founding chapters) like Iron Hands, Luna Wolves, Dark Angels, Emperor's Children, Imperial Fist and famously Ultramarines recruit anyone from anywhere so long as they are worthy. And because their genes are relatively stable, they do not completely inherent ALL of their Primarch's physical traits. Though you'd obviously find more blonde in say, Emperor's Children and Dark Angels than you would any hair on Luna Wolves.

Not exactly, but you racist AND stupid especially if you didn't know the lore, because from your perspective, why would there be an ethnic limitation in that regard? Get out of here with that you donkey.

Now with that out of the way, some thoughts about the game:

1. If you're a 40k buff, the design, scenery, voice-acting, atmosphere, weapons etc are all exactly what you'd expect Warhammer 40k to feel like.

2. Audio design for the most of it is impeccable.

3. Combat is fluid and mostly satisfying with one caveat (will elaborate in negative).

4. Beautiful graphics, even on my 3070ti at high mids it still looks fantastic.

5. Runs very great on my 3070ti, Ryzen 9 and 32gb DDR5. Though would recommend installing it on a nvme ssd to increase loading speed.

6. Only played about 1.5 hours of the campaign, but the lore so far is fantastic. How they speak, the mannerism of the Astartes, the imperials, the mechanicus etc are all as they should be.

1. ESG. This is the biggest middle finger and a complete deal breaker. Nevermind being forced a stealth installation of ESG onto your system, it ironically PREVENTS you from booting the game unless you go into task manager and DELETE ESG PROCESS. How stupid is that?

2. Second deal breaker for many, the FOV is horrible and there is no way to extend it. The space marine model eats 1/3 of your entire view, which severely reduces your peripheral awareness unless you are constantly looking around.

3. The weapons feel less impactful and heavy than they did in SM1. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if some of the weapon didn't feel so floaty/light (but then again, they are being welded by not just space marines, but Primaris so maybe it gets a pass).

4. Some weapons don't sound as punchy as it should be. The heavy bolter for example was defeaning in SM1 and especially in the Dawn of War games. Other weapons like the bolter pistol needs sound louder and more punchy (you are literally shooting a miniature rocket after all, and a normal unaugmented human can barely fire it without breaking their shoulders. Unless you're a Catachan, then you can fire anything).

5. Titus's first voice actor, Mark Strong, was way better than Clive Standen. Don't get me wrong, Clive does try hard and delivers as best he could, but there's something about Mark's voice that really suits a gruff veteran space marine.


Despite my grievance with some of the more creative decisions like the changing of Titus's voice actor and weapons sound/feel not as heavy as the first game, I understand why they did it. SM2 gameplay and combat is much more fast paced and fluid than SM1 ever was. It might be a solid reason, from a technical perspective to not have everything sounding like Ferrus Manus clapping Fulgrim's cheeks on Istvaan V or having the screen shake like it's Armageddon on a Tuesday. I can live with those decisions, not a deal breaker.

What is and WILL be a serious issue, is the presence of and the poor FOV (which can be easily fixed with an update to allow adjustments).",2024/9/6,en

The campaign is wonderfully done. It's very fun to customize your marine even if certain small traits (visor color, some more niiche colors like elbow braces) are not customization.

I would only really ask that the customization for chaos marines and the combat be tightened up just a bit more. It can be frustrating at times to be encouraged to do combos but you also cannot respond to counters/unblockable attacks being thrown in there.

Contra:
kurze Story(6 Missionen die jeweils ca 1h lang sind), kein Widescreen-Support(ändert sich bald schon), erstmal nur 6 PvE Missionen(wieder ca 45-1h lang und an sich gehören sie auch zur Story sollen aber dieses Jahr noch mehr kommen laut Roadmap), falls du auch ne Fps-Ho3 bist brauchst du Lossless Scaling(außer du hast ne 3070+), relativ repetetive ohne Hordemodus, Crossplay führt noch zu langen Ladezeiten, Server sind noch nicht perfekt

에픽런처+안티치트 2중 A.T필드 결계있음

작년부터 오랫동안 기다린 게임이라, 초반 평가가 박살나지만 않으면 구매하자고 맘 먹었다.
GTX 3070 QHD 게임자동설정, 균형모드로 60~ 80프레임 정도 나와서 최적화는 잘됐다.

요즘 나오는 게임들이 가면갈수록 게임이 어려워지는데, 넓은 오픈월드, 수많은 기믹, 복잡한 스킬트리에 게임을 하기위해서 게임을 공부해야 할 상황이 많은데 이게임은 그딴거 없다.

찢.어.발.긴.다!

전투스타일은 근접 7 원거리 3 비율로 근거리 전투가 메인이고 원거리가 서브인 느낌이 강하다. 왜냐면 근거리 패링시 이점과 처형으로 쉴드회복을 해줘야만 유지력이 올라가기 때문이다.

패링 타이밍과 가드불능 회피 타이밍을 화면에 알려주기 때문에 초보자들이 하기에도 부담이 없다. 오랜만에 날 것 그대로의 액션 썰고, 패고, 쏘고, 찢다보면 전투 그 본연의 재미가 느껴진다. 특히나 보스공격 5연타를 연속 패링하고 빈틈샷으로 뚝배기 깰때는 소울망자가 되버린 착각마저 들게 만든다.

플5시대에 맛보는 플2 시절의 갓오브워를 하는 기분이 난다!!! 사라! 특히 적 대규모 부대랑 싸울때 그맛이 딱 엣날 갓오브워 ㅋㅋ 피튀기고 찢는 상남자 전투

Kriev,1,76.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kriev/,"Brothers, this game stands as a beacon of the Emperor’s might, a war hymn to His eternal glory.

The campaign of Space Marine 2 is pure cinema, peak masculinity, but in the raw, honorable sense, not the forced ""feelings"" of modern (S o n y) entertainment. It is a worthy successor to the original Space Marine staying true to the true Warhammer 40k spirit, from the grimdark aesthetics and sharp dialogue to the visceral combat and unforgettable catchphrases, this game is steeped in the essence of the 40k universe. It definitively passes the vibe check.

There is no weakness here, no false sentiment, only the unyielding strength of the Adeptus Astartes. This is no charade of emotion from the weakling masses of modern Terra.

This sequel does honor to its predecessor, as any true son of Guilliman honors the gene-seed of his primarch. The game is the very essence of the 40k made manifest.

While fighting through Tyranid swarms, you witness Cadian squadrons holding the line against an unending tide of enemies. These moments offer a powerful sense of scale, while you may be the protagonist, you're just one cog in the massive war machine of the Imperium. The game does an excellent job showcasing the Imperium’s many parts, from the Astra Militarum and their discipline shouting Cadia stands while being charge by a swarm of gaunts, the Admech with their arrogance, disdain for the flesh and their many rituals to please the Machine Spirit to the zealous and fanatic Ecclesiarchy and, of course, the ever-present bureaucratic nightmare of the Administratum.

On the performance side, Space Marine 2 handles remarkably well, even when the screen is full with enemies and chaos. The fluidity helps maintain immersion, ensuring that you never lose sight of the epic scale and intensity of the battles and the scale of the conflict.

The companion AI, while functional, can be a bit off sometimes, often leaving enemies stunned without finishing them off. If you're not there to clean up after them, those enemies will recover and come back into the fight.

The co-op features are well-implemented, allowing you to seamlessly join your friends sessions via Steam or using an invite code. While playing with random players works fine, there are occasional slowdowns due to the lengthy loading screens when joining or leaving sessions. This could definitely be better as it can get a bit annoying.

ウォーハンマー40kを知らない人はストーリーに関しては何となくやっていることは理解できるが何を言ってるかよくわからないことが多いと感じるだろうと思う。
40年以上の歴史がある肉厚なストーリーなので、ある程度は仕方ないのかもしれないが、せめて用語集などがあったら良いと思った。

ストーリーモードは10時間ちょっとでクリアできる
戦闘に関してはTPSだが射撃より近接がメインと感じました。
ゲーム映像PVなどでは出現する雑魚敵をなぎ倒してるが、道中で湧くちょっと強い敵はしっかりパリィ、もしくは回避をしないとガンガン体力が削れていくため、攻撃ボタンを連打してるだけでクリアできるようなゲーム性ではないということに注意。

COOPに関しては2種類あり、メインストーリーも協力プレイが可能だが主人公タイタスと他のウルトラマリーンキャラクター固定のモードとなっており、カスタマイズ性皆無のモードとなっている。
メインストーリーの裏で活躍している兵士視点のオペレーションモードというものがある。
オペレーションモードがオリジナルスペースマリーンの作成、クラスごとの役割、武器成長あり、パークありのモードとなっており、オペレーションモードを遊ぶにはメインストーリーのステージをクリアしていく必要があるため、購入後すぐにオペレーションモードを遊ぶのは実質不可能な状態です。

オリジナルスペースマリーン作成では一部、後継戦団のデカールもしっかり用意されておりシタデルカラーベースで色を選択したりできてよかったが、仕様上ざっくり部位ごとに色を決めたりデカールを決めたりすることが可能なぐらいのカスタマイズ性のため、クリムゾンフィストのような拳だけを塗り分けている戦団の作成はできなさそうでそこは今後のアプデで改善に期待。


★本作をプレイする前に知っておくと良い設定。(作中での解説はされない)
Q.スペースマリーンって何？皇帝とは？
A.人類が宇宙進出をするにあたって、様々なトラブルに悩まされていたがそれを指導者としてまとめ救ったのが皇帝。
更に、皇帝自らの遺伝子を使用し人造人間を作成する。
そうして生まれた存在が原初のスペースマリーン「プライマーク(総主長)」
誕生した20人のプライマークたちは保育カプセルに入った状態で、異世界に住む邪神たち""ケイオス""(混沌の神々)の仕業で宇宙に散り散りとなってしまう。
プライマーク達は散り散りとなってしまったが、皇帝はプライマークの遺伝子を元にスペースマリーンを作成する。

Obwohl die Kampagne ein wenig kurz ausfällt und vielleicht in der Zukunft mit einer oder zwei Expansionen erweitert werden könnte muss man sagen das Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 in allen anderen belangen wirklich abgeliefert hat. Die Kampagne ist an Bombast kaum zu übertreffen, die grafische Darbietung ist wirklich optimal in Szene gebracht und lässt einen sehr oft mit offenem Mund einfach staunen.

Die Koop-Missionen machen auch sehr viel Spaß und erzählen die Geschichte des anderen Trupps neben Captain Titus und seinem Gespann.

Die Charakterentwicklung ist bei den Coop-Missionen und dem Multiplayer getrennt und lässt aber viel Spielraum um seinen Wunsch-Marine(oder ein bestehendes Chapter) entstehen zu lassen.Die Waffen levelt man separat durch die Nutzung mit.

Der Multiplayer ist auch schon wie beim ersten Teil damals einfach schönes Beiwerk und kann auch Spass machen wenn man mit den richtigen Leuten spielt. Aber auch wie damals im ersten Teil ist die Kartenvielfalt nicht groß, die Hitregistration nicht wirklich die beste und es kann schnell eintönig werden.

Es muss gesagt werden das zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt noch Optimierungsbedarf nötig ist. Das Game ist strak CPU-lastig und viele CPU´s , besonders Intel 13/14th Generation laufen sehr heiß bei diesem Titel und erreichen sehr gerne Mal ihr Limit. Eine gute Kühlung sollte schon vorhanden sein bis da etwas nachgearbeitet wurde. Undervolting sollte bei diesen Generationen ja schon fast obligatorisch sein. Ansonsten ist das Spiel nahezu bugfrei und läuft wirklich sehr rund.


Alles in Allem bin ich wirklich gespannt was uns in Zukunft noch alles erwartet....von mir eine klare Empfehlung.",2024/9/7,de

Aya,1,33.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/flashn00b/,"The Strongest 40K game for the Strongest Day
For anyone with even the slightest interest in Warhammer 40,000, this game's arguably the best Warhammer 40,000 title to release after the bankruptcy of THQ, after 13 years of getting a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that between 2018 and Boltgun's release, the best way to enjoy the Grim Darkness of the 41st Millennium in video games was honestly to create Space Marines in SoulCalibur VI. I'll admit i've only played the first missions of the main story and the co-op campaign respectively, though my first impressions of the game have me confident that I'm gonna get a lot of enjoyment from the rest of it.

Gameplay
Being a continuation of Relic Entertainment's Space Marine, combat is meant to have you split your attention between melee and ranged combat, and I feel like Saber Interactive did a much better job at making melee more viable compared to SM1, and I think the dodging and parrying mechanics were the main things that buffed the game's melee, cuz I remember that using your chainsword in the first game was a very fast way to get got by the Ork Boyz and Nobs, often really only being used in the campaign's jump pack sections.

One thing which I can already tell that people miss is SM1's health system. While I personally don't have issues with how health is handled in SM2, I feel like they could've introduced a temporary health mechanic similar to L4D's pain pills for the executions, cuz the armor blips tend to not last very long in the face of your ankles being bitten by multiple hormagaunts, and fodder enemies can be equated to death by a thousand paper cuts. This is a minor nitpick on my end, though one thing I've found from the first half of the second mission is a harsher criticism.

While other games might enjoy putting the player in a forced turret section, Space Marine 2 has forced flamethrower sections, where the game leaves a Pyreblaster near a door to inform the player that they will have to fight against Rippers, small legless creatures that are about the size of a house cat, but swarm you in the hundreds of thousands. It's annoying enough that firing the weapon slows your walking speed significantly, though the fact that they deal pathetically low damage is needless frustration, especiallly since the smaller mortal-sized flamers have been proven to be effective against Hormagaunt and (former) human alike in other forms of Warhammer 40,000 media.

Moving onto the co-op Operations mode, this to me feels like the co-op experience that fans have been craving since the days of the first Space Marine game. Though I've only really played the Vanguard, I found it to be a pretty solid experience, though I personally wish they added a Firstborn class in the game. To those unaware, Games Workshop has been trying to redesign the Space Marine identity from the ground up, though certain weapons from the earlier days of Warhammer 40,000 are unavailable to the modern depictions of the Adeptus Astartes.

With Warhammer 40K being full of intricate gothic architecture you'd expect to find in a fantasy setting with the first antagonist you fight being a swarm of buglike creatures that hope to overwhelm you with their numbers, I think it's fair to expect a hardware-intense game. With the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X targeting 1440p and 30FPS, it's fair to say that it's a pretty demanding game. I'm personally on a Ryzen 3800X and RTX 3070, and while i'm on 1080p myself, the game typically hovers around 50-81 FPS, though there are occasionally some dips down to 41 in moments of high activity. While demanding, I wouldn't call it unstable since in the 6 hours I've clocked in so far, I've actually only had one crash, which is a huge improvement from how frequently the leaked build would crash on the same machine. I don't think more modest machines can realistically target 60fps without utilizing the game's built-in upscaling options, though I think the Dynamic Resolution option isn't functional.

Those who have spent a lot of time personalizing their Space Marine in the first game are gonna be let down with the second one. With Games Workshop trying to push the Primaris Space Marines as the new face of Warhammer 40,000, the number of options available to customize your looks has been severely neutered, to such a degree they had to make colors and emblems unlockable. It's especially egregious in my personal opinion that the fully sealed Mk X Phobos helmet isn't in the game, since that at least is a callback to the old scowl helmets from the pre-9th Edition days of Warhammer 40K.

While we might never get a chance to beat up those holier-than-thou knife-ears that Guilliman seems so attracted to these days, Space Marine 2 is definitely one of those games where an admittedly painful wait turned out to actually be worth the delay it ate, which is a welcome surprise when you consider that game delays in current year are a sign of the dev team thinking that their game's an absolute dumpster fire, especially with 40K. Do i think that this game will be the standard that other devs will follow when handling the license? Unfortunately, no. With that said, I think the June 2024 leak has proven to be a blessing in disguise, and I hope that Saber would at least consider releasing the prologue and first mission for free as a post-release demo.",2024/9/11,en

Добавляет в него огромное количество фансервиса, кровищи, ультра-насилия и ультрадесанта, ураганного ГЕЙМПЛЕЯ! для вязкости, с мультиплеером сверху. Все это жарится до дыма.

С самого анонса, в далёком 2021 году, был заинтригован противостоянием космодесанта против пожирающих всё захватчиков из неизведанных просторов космоса - тиранидов. Суровое лицо из финала анонса, с испепеляющим взором главного героя, красноречиво говорило - лучше-бы тебе дождаться релиза рядовой...



Геймплейно игра представляет из себя экшен от третьего лица со всеми вытекающими. Получаем задание и идём прорубать себе путь из точки А в точку Б. Тут отмечу, локации идейно представляют из себя ""коридор"", но разработчик постарался и максимально дал разнообразия на свежем воздухе и минимум блуждания в унылых коридорах заводов(но куда без этого). На периферии периодически что-то взрывается, ломается и происходит разный движ, всячески подчеркивая масштабность происходящего. Благо графика не подкачала и всё смотрится отлично, помогая погружению в происходящее на экране монитора. Арсенал для приведения к согласию точно не поразит ваше воображение, но найти себе по душе нечто режущее, автоматическое или полуавтоматическое вы сможете без труда.

Управление нормальное, присутствуют простенькие комбо для холодного оружия, метки на врагах о блокируемой\не блокируемой атаке. Всё хорошо, но только до момента когда атакующих мобов становится совсем много, всё рискует слиться в кашу и вынуждает делать постоянные кувырки. Сам проходил игру в соло, на ""Ветеране"" и периодически встречались моменты где игра не давала продохнуть, в пати это было-бы не актуально. Болванчики чуть помогают на поле боя, но сильных надежд возлагать на них не стоит. В общем, если не планируете привлекать товарищей к прохождению, неготовы к духоте и вообще просто отдохнуть хотите, то первые две опции сложности будут лучшим выбором.

Так-же отмечу местные кооп PvE миссии - ""Сражение"". Становятся доступны они постепенно, по мере прохождения по сюжету, чуть дополняя основную ветку действий ГГ. Выбираете приглянувшийся класс космодесантника, оружие, уровень сложности и идёте кромсать всё живое с ещё двумя товарищами или рандомными игроками. Очень бодро играется при первых знакомствах с локациями. Параллельно там фармится местная валюта, опыт и уровень нужный для изменения внешнего вида онлайн персонажа, внешнего вида оружия и прокачки дерева перков. Словом - гринд.

Есть ещё PvP баталии, но это уже на любителя. Пропуск этого режима никакого влияния на впечатление от игры не окажет.

Сюжет здесь прост и незатейлив, стандартно стараемся предотвратить катастрофу, но оказывается что не всё так просто и тут могут быть замешаны некие скрытые силы. В самый раз, что-бы не перегружать игрока информацией на фоне происходящего на экране. Время прохождения будет варьироваться в районе 8-9 часов.

По итогу этот проект не идеален и при желании можно выцепить минусы и недочёты, но идеальных игр не бывает. Здесь захватывающая компания позволяющая побывать на трёх мирах и почувствовать себя брутальным космодесантником который превозмогая всё на свете идёт к своей цели. А визуальная составляющая помогает лучше прочувствовать это погружение. Отечественные разработчики Saber проделали большую работу. Уверен, им этот проект стоил внушительных сил и нервов... и они справились.

Ravn,0,25.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119673699/,"Preface before reading, I don't want the game to fail I just think it won't succeed without the heed of criticism. I never write reviews, but this game is being overly praised while being seriously flawed.

Pros:

- Great writing true to the warhammer universe.

- They included many chapters and their heraldry with a great framework to expand upon.

- Everything visually looks wonderful and grim in the best way possible. Not too taxing on my gpu or cpu.
(NVIDIA rtx 3070 ti, intel i9-12900K)

- Similarities and nods to the previous space marine game in the series.

- Audio sounds 'okay' except for the voice act which is superb.

- A fair amount of attention to detail throughout the game which is very nice to see.

Cons:

-Connectivity, nothing more must be said just look at the other reviews.

- Multiplayer being the main staying power of the game feels like an after thought and not fully thought through before implementing it. Of course not everyone cares about the multiplayer, but I see it as what would increase the longevity of the game.

- The melee system overall is very weak, especially in multiplayer. Parrying an enemy doesn't stun or hamper the other player in anyway in multiplayer. You can just wail on them until you when but even that is flawed because you are better off just using your bolter to win melee fights. The firearms do significantly more effective damage and don't lock you in a terrible animation. No aim punch or stagger from melee means closing the distance as a play still is dead, you should just play tactical or heavy every match. Locking your enemy into melee is a decided strategy and is not present.

- Getting kills in multiplayer is extremely underwhelming resulting in both the victor and the defeated just feeling frustrated. It would be rewarding if they care over the execute system from the campaign, maybe give you invincibility frames or just expedite the animation time to leave it for when you have opening for the time it would take.

- It's hard to tell when you are being hit, possible adding armor shift under fire or some sort of light stagger would fix that.

- Hitting enemies doesn't feel nearly as impactful as similar games and for a super human clad in metal. The bolter variants do appropriate damage but it doesn't feel like you are shooting anyone. Maybe this is the SFX department but it just feels a bit hollow.

- Biggest problem with the campaign that I experienced was enemies shooting my teammates and me through the world terrain or cargo containers, anything really it just seemed the ranged enemies could hit you from anywhere through anything. A problem with the engine or the assets I'm not sure, hopefully this gets fixed.

- No friendly fire seems like a mistake, I get its more casual friendly but I believe it does a great deal of immersive damage and also unbalances multiplayer. I can stack grenades on top of melee fights with my teammates just killing the enemy team and also it does damage yourself with some like the shock grenade.

- The physics system needs some work non-static items seem to be near weightless.

- So many great opportunities for fresh game modes but nope they went with the tried and true which is fine. Hopefully they get a little creative with the upcoming modes and maybe pull some ideas from the tabletop.

- A cover system seems not necessary, but would improve the combat immersively and tactically.

Conclusion:

The basics are there but it needs a lot of work, balancing, and straight up system changes. Sadly as a warhammer fan I would have to recommend against purchasing until the game gets some major polishing and a few changes to the core. Multiplayer could be a gem for this game.

剧情完整大概7-8H(完整就值得夸奖)但是，作为PVE游戏的前置剧情，推进没有任何人物奖励，却又分4个难度，N3+除了坐牢想不出有什么用，当你怀疑是不是因为人物没有能力点武器没有技能点导致的时候，噩梦开始了-->

开始游戏即默认霸王条款：默认绑定了EPIC在线服务，你必须先下载才能玩，跟EPIC的兼容性不用多说了吧。当年你WWZ在EPIC独占我以为有点啥缘故，结果现在STEAM也搞这些？说起WWZ，这游戏画面表现就像换皮的WWZ一样，处决倒是蛮带感的，但是武器打击感反馈真的是一如WWZ一样绵软，隔壁暗潮真能甩他几条街。武器品质分为白绿紫金，每个品质之下有不同型号的武器，获得经验就能升级，武器升级能有技能点，武器能直接喂材料满级，但是喂出来的武器不涨品质经验，也就是说假如打5把能满品质经验和武器经验，结果现在武器虽然满了你还是得去打5把获得品质经验，品质不升到下一阶你解锁不了更高阶武器，那么直升武器的意义在哪里？？正常游玩到了N3要获取紫图纸的时候你就卡住了，因为你会发现武器升不了阶没有更多技能点加攻击，堂堂雷锤都打不动怪，想蓄力潮能给你直接送走，小怪摸一下掉一格甲，三格甲的陶钢阿斯塔特犹如身披报纸一样脆弱，有的职业还只有两格，再配上超多的远程怪，你要被射爆，尤其打混沌，吃痛了人家直接瞬移拉开位置，喷火开枪，把你像放风筝一样玩弄，你跟他对枪犹如隔靴搔痒，硬得出奇。武器是分点击长按来搓招攻击的，还有在你以为你能爽砍的时候，给你来个QTE，打断你操作的节奏，整场游戏充斥着砍杀、QTE、翻滚，一时之间都不知道这到底是什么类型，而且每个点都达不到爽点。现在能打动怪的有且只有热熔一把枪，但只有三个职业有，而且还是因为有回血BUG，导致有了生存才能继续。
关于网络卡和匹配问题，建议你看看自己的网络或者加速器，STEAM游戏国内没有服务器，非P2P联机需要加速器这个是常识，开个加速器7-80延迟根本不会卡。至于闪退报错就不清楚了，没遇到过。

这个更是重量级，可能由于WWZ内容的匮乏，所以加入了PVP模式来延长游戏时间，但是一场PVP要获胜得有200分！一个人头才1分，就算挂哥一枪一个也得秒5分钟。对的，没错，一天不到就有了。你也能猜到挂哥的国籍。而且还把PVP内容加入了成就，以后通行证获取的皮肤也不知道会不会从PVP中获取。

如果你觉得都是因为我菜导致的，那么请看看著名大佬AVP2的原话：1）武器不平衡，能玩的武器少；2）近战的基础逻辑有问题，收益和风险不成正比（除开个别紧靠机制的打法，比如弹反人盾卫，但是这样打法很单一）；3）PVE开荒过渡期太长，玩家战力提升全靠等级解锁带来的强力天赋，导致前期体验十分坐牢；另一方面，缺乏有一定深度的loot系统，玩到后面你没东西可刷，但是爽杀也爽杀不起来，很难支撑长线运营的需求。

Так, саме вони видали Атомік Фарт та безліч іншого сміття типу Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 та інш. Саме вони восени 2022 просили вибачення у рашистів, це не жарт, вони реально у Твітери розмістили пост із аквафрешем та вибаченнями, і це саме тоді, коли масово почали обстрілювати міста України. Уявіть собі рівень цинізму!
Про видавця можете детально почути у цьому відео:

Тож висновок простий, не купуйте ВСІ ігри Saber Interactive і бажано також і видавця Focus Entertainment, але з видавцем складніше, бо там є розробники, які ніби то підтримали Україну, ну наприклад розробники A Plague Tale: Requiem.
Також додатково надаю в текстовому вигляді інформацією щодо розробника:



Do not buy this game, the developer is located in the Russian Federation, in the city of St. Petersburg and actively supports war, mass murder, shelling of cities, kidnapping of children, rape, etc.
Every dollar from sales of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is the death of another peaceful Ukrainian.

The beautiful details to the environment, weapons, lore; it's all there and faithful. One of the most fun I've had, I'd dare say the best 40k game to date (makes me want an Imperial Guard game by these guys). A complete package of PvE and PvP with all future content free. The season pass only holding cosmetics. No pesky microtransactions, time savers, or any other games as service BS. The devs listening and bringing updates and changes upon what the audience as a whole seem to resonate with is also a breath of fresh air.

The fact the game can still be played in ""offline"" mode is a godsend in itself and a rarity for many a-game in 2024.

My only real complaints are things that can be changed & fixed with time. The bugs in the experience (I've had a few crashes).
The other is the lack of customization for the Chaos Space Marines minus paints and decals. I do see segments for pre-built armor sets, but who knows, maybe they'll open customization to it in the future if the game continues move forward. This game has 2 million players (and growing) at the time of this review.

Хвалить эту игру можно очень долго, но к сожалению в ней есть пара недостатков которые могут заставить лишний раз подумать - стоит ли брать?
- На момент написания обзора у игры есть тех проблемы и косяки оптимизации (лично у меня всё было отлично, но вот у знакомых нет)
- Есть проблемы сетевой составляющей, порой идет невероятно долгое подключение по итогу которого тебя просто кикнет и плохо сохраняются настройки кастомизации (банально слетают из раза в раз)
- Цена. Как фанат, я конечно оценил весь контент который мне предложили, но 3к все же многовато для игры в которой контента (без длс и перепрохождений) не так уж и много. Но это поправляется реиграбельностью и интересом самих миссий/операций. К тому же, разработчики планируют вводить такие дополнения и миссии в дальнейшем, что побуждает и дальше играть в этот проэкт.
На этом лично для меня минусы закончились, это отличное комплексное приключение как на одно лицо, так и на совместный замес с 2мя верными друзьями! Операции на высоких сложностях бросают неплохой челлендж, а пвп режим сможет немного разнообразить игру. Очень много внимания уделили и гвардии, фанаты явно это оценят, видно что ребята делали игру с любовью и стараниями, поэтому отдельное спасибо разработчикам за ПОЛНУЮ русскую озвучку, ребят вы лучшие!

Cubano,0,25.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049245659/,"I completed the game and every operation on difficulty 2/4.
I do not recommend this game and here is why:
- it feels bad to shoot any weapon other than melta or charged plasma because they deal no damage, it takes more than a clip from any bolt weapon to throw any medium unit into executable state (way way too long), enemies shrug 30-40 direct hits from HEAVY BOLTER like it was a toy gun
- melee is not fun, you get stagger locked and killed by medium enemies
- it feels bad to use chainsword (thunderhammer and power sword feels better but they are not available on 4/6 of operation classes), you cut down the small enemies, but fighting any medium+ is not fun - they will either dodge or play red or blue with you.
- medium+ enemies in melee stagger you with every hit, but your attacks do not
- enemies like to play with you in red and blue, dodge or parry, do it wrong and you lose 50%-75% of health
- enemies are able to teleport or dodge like 10 meters, your dodge is like 1m
- health and armor system is very badly implemented - SM1 had it much better. You cannot recover health with finishers, only armor, yet you lose armor almost instantly. To do a finisher on enemy you need to hit it real good to recover like 1 armor segment.

It is just not fun to play right now.
I do not want to play a class in operations for 10h before it feels fun to play, I want it to feel good from start and then just get better. Most people will play an operation or two, see it is not fun and leave.

Cosas buenas:


- Los graficos son de 10, me repito, parece una pelicula.

- Fidelidad absoluta a la franquicia

- Jugabilidad y mecanicas


Malas:

- Hay perdida de frames y un uso de CPU elevado que se va a corregir en parches, asi que no es un problema.

- Los colores del pintaejercitos debarian ser gratuitos. No puedo crear a mi capitulo porque el azul que necesito es de DLC. Creo que lo unico de pago debaria ser cosmetico a nivel armadura sin restringir los colores.

- Algunos colores no quedan bien pintados segun que zonas porque el tono no coincide con el color.

- Rangos DLC. Para crear a los tenientes y a los sargentos veteranos necesitas tambien el patron de DLC y no parece justo tampoco. (Me comprare el DLC mas adelante de todas formas)



Cosas que yo metería en el multijugador:


- Que cuando personalices a tu marine los colores aplicados sean tambien aplicados al resto de toda la flota para que de esa forma si tienes un capitulo propio sientas esa inmersión.

- El modo PVP debería tener un PVE tambien desde mi punto de vista porque yo y todos mis amigos somos jugadores PVE. (Esto no es necesario pero si habria mas gente casual que simplemente quiere pasar un buen rato con sus amigos)

Ich war ein großer Fan des ersten Space Marine Teil entgegen der negativen Kritiken die es damals hagelte! Insofern war meine Freude das es eine Fortsetzung gibt sehr hoch! Leider kann ich diesem Spiel dennoch keine gute Bewertung dalassen!
Es liegt weder an der Technik noch der Atmosphäre, das ist soweit Top und macht optisch wirklich etwas her. Die Beleuchtung, die riesigen Schwärme , die Kulisse, alles sehr schick..ABER...

Diese Spiel schwächelt meiner Meinung nach am Kampfsystem, und das , wo es doch ein Action Game sein soll...
Der gesamte Kampf wirkt einfach extrem ""schwammig"". Man prügelt wie wild, ohne jeden Sinn und Verstand drauf los. Treffer hagelt es von allen Seiten so das mann zeitweise nichts anderes tun kann außer permanent die Leertaste zu spammen. Man hat zu keiner Zeit das Gefühl irgendwie wirklich Einfluss auf den Kampf zu haben ob man nun gut oder schlecht spielt! Es hagelt einen Treffer nach dem anderen und es gibt eigentlich nichts was man dagegen tun könnte. Gelegentlich, wenn man es denn in dem ganzen Gewusel mitbekommt, kann man mal einen Block raushauen. Hier wirkt das ganze dann auch wuchtig, geht jedoch in dem ganzen durcheinander völlig unter.
Ich habe es auf Schwer und Leicht gespielt, und völlig Wurst ob man sich gut oder schlecht anstellt...irgendwie kommt man schon durch! Das erfordert keinerlei Können oder Raffinesse sonder ist schlichtes Tastengehämmere!

Beim ersten Teil war auch ordentlich was los auf den Schlachtfeldern, aber wenn ich hier meine Attacken und Finisher gut getimt habe, hatt ich Einfluss darauf wie sich der Kampf entwickelt! Kämpfte ich schnell, nutzte Betäubungsschläge konnte ich länger im Kampf bestehen und letzten Endes den Kampf für mich entscheiden!

Hier ist es völlig egal wie ich kämpfe, die Treffer kassiere ich so oder so, dann gibt es alle paar Sekunden mal eine Konterattacke und einen Finisher der sich jedoch extrem schnell abnutzt. Diese Konter sind auch das einzige was man wirklich in der Hand hat. 95% der Treffer kassiert man trotzdem ob man nun geschickt ausweicht oder nicht und am Ende kommt man dann so oder so durch den Kampf ohne eigentlich zu wissen wie!

Die Kämpfe sind schlicht viel zu unübersichtlich und man haut einfach wild drauf los mit immer und immer und immer......und immer den selben stumpfen Attacken! Wenn man sich einem größeren Gegner stellt wird man in der Zeit hundert mal von hinten getroffen von Hormaganten die einfach stumpf an deiner Figur ""kleben"" .Die stehen einfach dumm da und man verliert Leben und Rüstung ohne etwas dagegen unternehmen zu können !
Die Schläge sind extrem unpräzise und gehen allzu oft ins Leere. Der Marine stapft dabei einfach schwerfällig vorwärts und haut ein und dieselbe Kombo nach der anderen raus .",2024/9/11,de

So the reason i'm on the fence, Whats going to keep me coming back for more?
I mean, i've completed the campaign and the side missions. So basically all that's left for me to do is rinse and repeat on higher difficulties to level up my brother, for what? So i can just log in and be like, wow he looks awesome.

ashax,1,147.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ashax/,"Campaign:
Great Cinematic experience, better with friends, very cool.
Only low point I can think of are the ""Rats"" section of the 2nd mission and some downtime sections from the ""Cave"" mission.

PvP:
It's ok, a bit death-bally and significantly less emphasis on Melee in my short experience with it.
I didn't have much interest in it before and quickly lost interest in it, so I haven't played a lot of rounds nor grind each classes to unlock their other, more interesting weapons.

(Co-)Operations:

Patch 3.0 (2024/09/26) update:

Armor attrition vs Minoris is better which made the melee combat survivability less punishing or gunstrike reliant. Adjusted spawns for the Chaos faction nerfs made it less overwhelming.

Overall an improvement to the push forward combat that plays better and makes you feel more like a Space Marine, but also makes the game easier (which I think is alright as they will add new enemies and difficulty tier).

They also fixed the bugs with the Supply pod full healing characters with +20% max HP passive/ perk and healing past contested health bug with Melta/ Las Fusil/ etc. which is good.

Original Launch review:

Only having 6 missions on launch is terrible, -Tide games and World War Z had more on launch in the past and still needed more content.

Balance seemed all over the place.
At the higher difficulties, there are fewer resources, it felt similar to the tactical survival experience of Back 4 Blood and World War Z. Depending on your build, you want to be thrifty with ammo and to save it for a wave/ Terminus miniboss/ or an enemy calling for reinforcements from an out of reach place.

Enemies becomes bullet spongy at higher difficulties and are more numerous, and Medicae Stims heals less HP. Different weapon types seem to have different effectiveness vs specific enemies. Running away to the next airlock/ elevator to despawn enemies behind you is cheesy and effective, but not fun.

You have to ration your ammo in-between fixed ammo crate placements and try to use melee, the environment, and equipment you find as optimally as possible (explosive barrels, explosive flowers, and level gimmicks such as the fire wall at the end of the first mission or the train diverter control panel in the last mission).

Regardless of the difficulty, missions have RNG aspects to it such as the mid-level events requiring 0-6 (!) sub-objectives to complete.

Perk and class balance seemed to be all over the place, but I need to play more to be sure, and there seems to be some bugs or hidden effects.
Examples for balance stuff:
- Certain classes have ammo generation perks later on in their class (or weapon perk line) which seems to be a mandatory pick compared to the other options;
- Bulwark's 23 perk restores contested health to your max HP which substantially reduces the need for healing items when paired with executions, or allowing full heal + wound restoration when paired with a Medicae Stim.

Also you use the same currency to buy weapons, class perks, and Space Marine Chapter Customization and you always feel poor while progressing initially, with some classes having more expensive weapons (e.g. Assault).

You also need to grind each class and weapons types.

Поиграл несколько дней, прошел игру. Мне понравилось. Есть, разумеется, косяки, особенно русская озвучка, местами звучит... Очень странно, особенно в аудиодневниках, но их я нашел не то чтобы сильно много. Можно, естественно, включить оригинальную озвучку, тем более это делается в любой момент игры и никаких проблем, но в суете, которая происходит на экране, не всегда успеваешь все разобрать. Пока по мелочи.
Многие почему-то пишут про какие-то сбои, зависания и все в этом духе. Я с таким не столкнулся, при том что у меня комп не самый топовый, так что не знаю, в чем проблема у остальных. Может приколы с драйверами?
Но была и большая проблема, которую нормально решить пока не получилось. При первом запуске геймпад подцепился нормально и я играл с него, но потом началось какое-то варпово колдунство. Из-за чего приходится каждый раз заходить в настройки контроллера стим и там его выключать и включать. Может быть проблема конкретно у меня, не знаю.
В остальном игра отличная, эпик, размах и пафос в должном количестве. Задел на сиквел имеется, так что пора добивать оставшиеся миссии с корешами и ждать новых сезонов и продолжения.

Avant de poster vérifier vos pc et laisser la possibiliter de vous offrir de l'aide pour vos soucis en activant les commentaires.

ce jeu demande une configuration avancée, oublier la configuration minimale, un ssd, et un pc avec au minimum des valeurs simmilaire a celle de la recomandation optimale.
si malgré cela vous avez encore des problemes, il faudra regarder ailleur, pour exemple via votre gestionaire des taches pour reperer ce qui prend beaucoup de ressource sur votre machine, voir si tous vos drive sont a jour etc...
ce que je peu dire à titre informatif, le jeu fonctionne super bien, fluide, pas de plantage, configurer au maximum au niveau graphique sans perte de performance et il me reste enormément de ressource libre sur ma machine.

La configuration des bios par les constructeur de carte mere pour les processeurs dernieres generation sont souvent la cause de beaucoup de probleme sur les nouveau pc.(connu chez MSI et Asus, mais d'autre aussi).
Une mise a jour des bios ou le reglage de ceux si sont necessaire pour diminuer la surchauffe et les plantages de vos pc ou pour stabilisé vos processeurs. (recurant sur les processeurs 14 eme generation)

There will be a TL;DR at the end.

~

The game falls short of its own shadow in many ways.
It is without character development and story
It is without the variety.
It is with a less consistent/polished core loop.

The testosterone filled glory of the combat swells the brain with glee, but dulls after a few hours.

- Controls Are Awkward - KBM is trash, you’ll need a gamepad, although it’s not much better. You never really get used to it.
- Multiplayer Focus - In case you’re here for the campaign.
- - Repetitive, but not bad,
- Not 40k Faithful - Boltguns tickle enemies, Chew Through rare enemies, blasphemous plot, etc.
- Surprise! - It wants to be a Live Service game.
- Unfinished Grenade UI - they seem the same on HUD ?
- Gun Execute is Blah - at the beginning is super cool;not punchy enough, you end up chaining them together over and over to kill 1 guy.
- Ammo? - It is not precious, but it's also not plentiful.
- FOV - way too shallow
- ""Hold to interact"" - ew.
- Buggy - Including enemies shooting through walls, not picking up items, clipping, and more.
- Missing Features - Can’t snap to targets. Needed for controller.
- No squad customization - ???
- No Troop Variety - Never fight beside mechanical troopers or mercs. Sad.
- None of the little soldiers ever survive - :(
- Campaign Overstays Welcome - It's a 5-6 hour experience in an 8-9 hour package.
- Very Stingy on healing - Awkward unlike other games in the medium.

- Bullet Sponge Enemies - Dump 3 clips of bolter ammo into a normal guy’s head.
- Stun Locks - Get messed up and tossed around sometimes.
- Antithetical Dance - Combat stutters and fails to flow.
- No Upgrades in Campaign - All the cools stuff is in Multiplayer.
- Lack Of Mechanical Depth - Tastes like a cake missing ingredients
- Sound is off - voice is especially low.
- Flat characters - Unsurprising and uninteresting.
- No collectables - ????!?
- Health Sponge - Armor is fickle, and your health is constantly chipped down with few ways to earn it back.
- AI allies are goofy - and enemies disregard them.
- Invasive ""Always Online"" BS - Makes it harder to enjoy at times.
- NDA and Information Harvesting - I don’t usually have to sell my soul to play a game.
- Was that my gun? - Non-dynamic weapon models for cutscenes. C’MON IT’S 2024!
- Pinning animations are too long - repeating several times.
- Bosses are boring bullet sponges - Not mechanically challenging, just take forever.
- No Controller Presets where swapping weapons is NOT on the D-Pad - You will be doing this constantly
- Weapons don't feel like wins - they all feel like losers in some way.
- Pathetic weapon variety - They look drab and insultingly similar, they play the same.
- Bosses are normal enemies? - For some they just slap a big healthbar on a normal Elite enemy and recycle others.
- Neutral melee attacks… - cause your character to turn around and not attack where you're facing.

- Solid flow - fans rejoice!
- 2010's goodness - Simplicity!
- throwback - ""Cooridor Shooter"" vibes in a good way.
- Great Enemies! - Tyanid/Zerg foes are super fun to blast away at!
- Looks gorgeous - Pleasing to the senses!
- Music can be inspiring! - Swelling overtones!
- Juicy - Tons of executions and combat punch
- Guns sound powerful! - Even if they don’t do much, you feel like a beast
- Fun with Friends! - Everything is, but this is a good experience to share!
- Satisfying Destruction! - My therapist recommends this.
- Lots of cool locations! - No longer stuck on the machine world of !
- Nerds Rejoice! - Lots of little goodies for 40k fans!
- Lots of variety! - Modes, Modes, MODES! Throwback to 2009 with how much content!

is fun for a time. It’s novel for 40k fans who will enjoy the tropes, much like many star wars folks these days. Hyper dramatic combat loop dazzles at first and fizzles without variety, but keeps you engaged to get your money’s worth. Made me want to read the books, had novel vibes at times in a good way. It's more of the original Space Marine 1 without too much added, and that’s good in and of itself. The game has a AAA look and a mid-range feel; while suffering from the issue of having lots of enemies to kill and not enough resources to do so efficiently.

Brother AWAS,0,146.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198103479992/,"TLDR - The game is great but the initial experience during the early access was atrocious for co-op. I highly recommend it now but I can't leave a thumbs up for paying to play a Beta test for their co-op servers. Co-op was advertised ages ago, it should've worked for everyone in all regions.

My initial experience before the server maintenance:-
Get yer damn co-op servers running. We can barely play together dangit. It has bee 6 hours of being in game, half that time was either me looking at ""Joining server"" or my friend experiencing the same. And when we do play... it's not so bad. Game's pretty fun. But hot damn get the servers workin.

Another 7ish hours later and the co-op servers still suck.
Tried all the possible fixes on the internet and still nothing.
This game was advertised to having co-op so you'd expect to have it on the get go.

After the server maintenance:-
The co-op finally works.
No work around, no fiddling with the settings, just share your code and there's your friend in the lobby. The squad works in all game modes. I'm having fun and I'm enjoying everything the game has to offer and am excited to see what comes next on the road map.

If you wanna know more about the game itself check out the other reviews cause they can probably do a better job explaining it.

With all that said, first impressions count and that initial roller coaster of nothingness still has a lingering impact. We were told we could play the game early if we bought it early. Apparently, that only applied to certain people and in certain regions. Some people got their moneys worth while others didn't. As much as I want to leave a thumbs up for the game, I can't. I can tell you the game's good now overall but that's as far as it goes. I don't usually pre-order games but hot damn it was never bad enough to write a review about it.",2024/9/6,en

Hikarian,0,3.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mehendre/,"Prinzipiell ein gutes Spiel, aber ich kann einfach nicht guten Gewissens Faulheit supporten. Aber was bedeutet das?

Grafisch ist das Spiel sehr gut, kein Meisterwerk aber bedenkt man wie viele Gegner gleichzeitig im Spiel sind is das schon ok. Ich spiele auf 4k mit ner 7900XTX und nem Alienware Oled Monitor. Alles auf max und man hat zwischen 40-80 FPS also sehr gut optimiert. Leider kein HDR support.

Die Story ist halt totaler Schwachsinn wenn man sich mit dem Lore auskennt, der ganze Planet müsste voll von Space Marines sein damit man überhaupt ne Chance hat, aber gut is halt ein Spiel das is auch ok.

Wo kommt die Faulheit ins Spiel? Beim Kampfsystem, eigentlich könnte das ein geiler Shooter sein aber die Entwickler erzwingen einen Mix aus Nahkampf und Fernkampf damit hab ich kein Problem Darktide hat das ja sehr gut gemacht.

Aber hier ist das extrem schlecht umgesetzt, man bekommt nur aufs Maul weil man konstant umzingelt ist das Spiel baut darauf auf das man das aushalten kann, was mich stört ist das die Gegner KI speziell die Fernkämpfer nur und explizit den Spieler angreifen, große Gegner wie der Carnifex können Fernkampfangriffe komplett abblocken, mit 2 Schwertern ja ne is klar. Höhere Schwierigkeitsgrade sind total lame gemacht einfach Gegner hat jetzt mehr HP und macht mehr Damage. Bei den Nahkampfangriffen hat man sich gedacht wenn man nach jedem Hit so ne art Lag einbaut verpasst das den Schlägen mehr Wucht aber es nerft total, aber anscheinend bin ich der einzige den das stört. Fernkämpfer treffen einen auch immer wenn man nicht aktiv ausweicht, also nur in Bewegung bleiben hilft eigentlich nicht.

Im Prinzip ist es WWZ im Warhammer Universum die Tyraniden klettern sogar exakt gleich wie die Zombies wo rauf.

Ich denke wenn man das im Coop mit echten Menschen spielt is es sicher ganz lustig aber mit Bots fallen die Schwächen halt total auf. Wenn man hier keinen Spacemarine spielen könnte sondern das irgend ein anderes Setting wäre könnt ich mir gut vorstellen das das Spiel auch gefloppt wäre.

Objektiv wäre Darktide das bessere Spiel WENN sich Fatshark dazu herabgelassen eine Kampange einzubauen oder irgendetwas mit der Story zu machen.

Fazit: Kann man sich durchaus gönnen, wenn das Geld knapp is auf nen Sale warten das dauert sicher nicht lange kurz vor Weihnachten. Es ist ein gutes Spiel wird dem Hype aber nicht gerecht. Aus dem Kampfsystem hätte man echt mehr rausholen können.",2024/9/7,de

+ Truly an epic campaign
+ Looks great
+ Gameplay is solid, brutal, bloody and gives a good challenge on higher difficulties

+ 6 unique classes for PVE and PVP
+ Great optimazation

- No Chaos customization in multiplayer, you can only changes their color not a single piece of armor
- Only 3 maps for multiplayer... truly a heresy
- 3 multiplayer modes aren't much better... Team Deatmatch, Capture point and Mobile Capture Point. Truly nothing special.
- For me game takes literally few minutes to quit... faster is just to press ALT+F4
- Though 6 PVE scenarios that we curently have are pretty good, on longer run they will lack replayability

워해머 세계관의 TPS 슈팅 게임 스페이스 마린의 후속작

오래되어서 기억이 하나도 나진 않지만 전작을 꽤 재밌게 했던 이미지가 남아있어서

나름 기대를 하면서 골드 에디션을 구입, 어드밴스드 억세스로 4일 먼저 플레이 해보았다.



오프닝 동영상과 몰려오는 저글링같은 적들을 쓸어담고 나니

게임에 대한 기대가 올라갔지만 그 기대는 오래가지 않았다.



상당히 큰 행성급 스케일 전투와 그에 대한 연출로 볼거리는 꽤 있지만

스테이지의 구성 자체가 이동 - 전투 - 이동 - 전투의 느낌을 강하게 받고

진행에 따른 캐릭터의 성장요소나 스킬 습득 같은 추가 요소들이 거의 없다시피 해서

코어 게임플레이에 상당히 의존적이며 깊이감이 부족함을 느낀다.

적들의 종류나 인상적인 보스전이 많이 없는 것도 이런 느낌을 가속화시킨다.



캠페인에 있으면 좋았을 스킬이나 무기 레벨업은 PvE모드에는 존재하는데

정작 PvE 미션 자체가 6개밖에 없는데다가 난이도 단계를 제외하면

굳이 반복을 해서 플레이할만한 동기부여나 재미를 찾기 힘들다.



그래도 게임플레이 자체가 기본적인 TPS 슈팅 게임의 재미는 충족시켜주고 있어서

한번정도 캠페인 + PvE 미션을 깨는 재미는 있겠지만

요즘 시대에 풀프라이스 (정가 79800원, 4일 먼저 하려면 104800원) 로

이정도 깊이와 컨텐츠는 좀 부족하지 않나 하는 생각이 들었다.",2024/9/8,ko

First off the game does look and sound amazing and does Warhammer 40,000 every bit of justice it possibly can, there's tons of detail everywhere and the environments and scale of the enemy hordes are seriously impressive. And it's not just a cosmetics thing, you can see the swarms climbing walls and such and you can destroy them. The basic combat once you get used to the parry and dodge system works pretty well and the weapons feel like they all have a use; I tried to use most of the weapons I picked up during my playthrough and there were few straight up upgrades, more like sidegrades.

The structure of the missions is very linear and there's generally very few things to find apart from audio logs. At the start of the game it felt like you got obstructed very often, I kept walking into invisible walls, but I think the game opens up later on more and the midway part of the campaign had the best mission variety. Sadly I think the campaign falls off towards the end, but other than that, I mostly had a good time. I wish the jetpacks would have been used more in missions.

Now onto the things I didn't like; the whole campaign seems designed more for co-op play than singleplayer. The AI teammates are generally very bad at covering you while doing objectives (+ they cannot do objectives themselves), and you'll regularily get pinned down by ranged enemies all the time, so in every encounter you have to hyperfocus the ranged enemies down first because the AI won't be doing that. At first I started the campaign on Veteran difficulty and I found it to be too annoying to complete with the AI so I switched to Normal after a couple missions and had a much better time. But still the squad AI could really be better, the game should offer a more balanced singleplayer experience. (EDIT: This was improved in patches which is good!)

Also (potential spoilers warning), the campaign isn't very long, I finished it in just about 11 hours, while generally taking my sweet time to explore as well. Towards the end it's like they forgot the beginning of the invasion (Tyranids) completely and the ending felt very cliche and Disney like. I did like that they introduced more enemies later on and I'm a fan of different than usual Chaos factions being represented but it felt like there should have been more story missions across all the planets. I know there's the Operations mode and Eternal War, and I expect that'll add a lot more playtime, but the main campaign felt quite short. (EDIT - Operations has been quite fun if a bit grindy, Eternal War is a pretty typical pvp mode and could use more interesting maps and customization imo)

The game ran well on my laptop with an i9 13980 HX, 32 GB RAM and Nvidia 4090 RTX 16 GB; on 2560x1600 resolution I could play it on high settings with ultra textures (without any upscaling), getting between 60-80 FPS. Some of the larger fights dipped as low as 50 but not below that. I'll probably test how it runs at 4K later on but I'd expect it to require some DLSS at least.

I didn't like that the game has no support for aspect ratios other than 16:9, so at 16:10 I had constant black bars on my screen all the time and it should really be fixed as it's a standard feature in PC games. Also, there was no support for inverted horizontal camera controls for gamepad, so I couldn't play it on gamepad since I use fully inverted controls (both vertical + horizontal) in all games I play; another thing that should be fixed and added to options. Had to learn to play on keyboard & mouse instead :p

TL;DR:
Solid gameplay; nice WH40K aesthetic; poor AI and mission design more for co-op; short campaign that falls off towards the end; some annoying missing technical features",2024/9/8,en

Sieghart,0,116.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042573112/,"Edit: I'm switching some categories around and migrating my overall reason for not recommending the game to lean more towards the incredibly unstable matchmaking system.

Pros
-Intense and dynamic combat
-Great graphics
-Interesting story so far
-Multiplayer is fun and addicting (have not tried PvP yet)
-There's a nice blend of needing to use all weapons at your disposal

Cons
-Friendly bot AI is not the best. They seem to be randomly aggressive and passive at weird intervals.
-The matchmaking system is quite unstable, leading to excessive load screens. I don't actually believe this is a server performance issue, I think it's how the matchmaking system is currently designed. *If a player queues for quick match and...: 1. gets a mission they don't like and leaves the squad. 2. does not want to be a party leader and leaves the squad / quits to title screen. ...this seems to have a direct impact on the players who get pulled into the queue of this player that did not stick around. I believe (not a confirmed fact) this is why we see a lot of ""joining server"" load screens that take a long time. I want to say the game is not optimized for dealing with these scenarios.

Pro/Con
-Ammo economy can be rough in some points of missions and can make progression more difficult than expected. Learning to search crates for ammo and being wise with ammo consumption helps with this.
-There is a strong focus on needing to use the parry system. Some people may hate that, others may not. Once you get the hang of it though, your gameplay improves quite a bit.
-Incoming damage is a bit rough, especially melee attacks, but this does condition you to block, parry, and improve movement more.
-There is an intense amount of grinding needed to achieve progression in multiplayer. Some may see this as a good thing to stay motivated to play, others may think it's too much of a grind fest and not enjoy it.
-Restricting multiplayer play to one class per player. This creates diversity however is an immediate generation of frustration for players who can't consistently play the class they wish to play.

Overall, I am enjoying the game. However, I would like to see some improvements before I feel I can confidently recommend the game.",2024/9/11,en

An entertaining linear story mode at around 5-6 hours (on Normal mode), though for maximum enjoyment you should have played or at least seen a recap of Space Marine 1. (And/or understanding Warhammer 40K lore)

A 3 man Co-op ""Operations"" mode that sees you play as your own different Marines that you can customize head to toe (from 6 different classes) and go on missions with other aspiring recruits/players trying to level up and score better gear.

Though at the moment there are only 6 missions to complete. They mostly feel good to play through, and multiple runs are needed to upgrade and level up your Space Marine.

(This is also the live-service, seasonal part of the game so expect content updates unless something completely unexpected happens).

There is also a very fun but very dry no nonsense PVP akin to old COD lobbies but without the vulgarities, racism, and probably no no-scopes (yet).

Hope the devs update this ""Eternal War"" mode as well cause there is some good building blocks to work with.

Combat is very fun, consisting of dodges and parries to outmaneuver and counterattack the enemy respectively.

Not too much to learn other than the timings of parries/dodges and melee combos of each weapon but the chaotic horde-style gameplay will still sometimes give you problems even if you have mastered the intricate art of murdering other Alien lifeforms.

Efendi_,0,76.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004908459/,"Regrettably i am leaving a negative review pointing out the serious shortcomings of Space Marine 2 as a veteran Vermintide/Darktide player who loves 40k lore.

- During the first launch of the game, Epic games online components are installed automatically without a prompt screen. I do not want it in my computer. You have to go through loops to uninstall it. There is a reason why i am using steam and steam only and i want the developers to respect it.
- When compared with Darktide, Dawn of War series and especially Mechanicus, Space Marine 2 has the weakest music OST. Looks like it was not even at top ten of the priority list during development.
- As a cheap attempt, the game is trying to draw more attention by Twitch drops.
- Very terrible companion ai. One of the worst i have seen for years. They do not use their ranged weapons in most cases and run gret distances to melee an enemy regarless of the class. And they very rarely execute a stunned elite enemy who is only two feet away from them. Such a shame.
- No FOV slider.
- Holding buttons to activate the abilities, instead of hitting them, is a terrible design choice.
- Throwing a frag grenade takes two seconds, activating cloak takes another 2.5 seconds. Character gets hit during uncancellable animations. Every movement and ability use feels unresponsive and stiff during the campaign and multiplayer. Runningg gets interrupted for no reason even if you are holding shift and not even hit by anything.
- Uncancellable dodge, roll over and similar animations are the primary reason why i keep dying. Controls feel very unresponsive.
- Boss fights are almost identical. Area attacks such as some form of 3 round mortar shots, melee charge attacks, ranged attacks and one big 3-wave either green or purple wide area attack which can hit even behind cover is the same rinse and repeat mechanic for both tyranid and chaos bosses.
- Melee combat is terribly designed. Interruptions are common and costs the player half of his health points.
- Ranged weapons feel weak. An elite enemy (Not a boss or a lecter) takes 30 to 40 bolter rounds to put down. Crossing bone swords makes the enemy immune to ranged damage even if you hit the legs, head or spray it from sides.
- The enemies i have mentioned above are bullet sponges but a hit from them take out half of your hp.
- Crowd control options are limited to grenades. I suggest developers to play Vermintide and Dark Tide to see how it is perfected during many years.
- There is a hideous terrible jetpack mission. I hated it.
- Multiple 'Loading resources - loading logic' screens.
- Entire multiplayer lobby system has to be redesigned. It is bad.
- You cannot inject your allies with the stimpack you have in your inventory.
- PVP section of the game is the worst. Very unbalanced. Is this game not beta-tested?
- Cheaters are out there already. I have already witnessed speedhacks and maphacks.
- Easy Anticheat is known as how 'Easy' it is to bypass it. A bad choice from the developers.
- The number of the co-op missions is very few. These missions in general feel rushed, unfinished and exteremely repetitive with very little variation. Even the spawn locations are more or less the same.
- Unlocking armor pieces or better versions of the same weapon is very grindy. This is how the game targets longevity.
- The game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly. I do not expect it to have a long lifespan.
- I was unable to pickup some medkits, ammo boxes or grenades even i had the inventory slot available. Pickup prompt was not there.
- Ranged enemies shoot with 120% accuracy and every shot lands perfectly.
- There is a shield or armor mechanic which recharges a specific amount with combo kills. This mechanic is not working as intended and definitely not user friendly.

Resumen:
Un juego como los de antaño (que tampoco hay que irse muy lejos), con una historia fenomenal, tiros a mansalva, mecánicas muy difíciles y a veces frustrantes, pero que una vez superas el nivel de gratificación es elevado. Su historia, es espectacular y que todo warhammero o fan de la acción disfrutará y la caracterización de los personajes es sublime, como debería ser en todos los juegos.

Historia:
Simplemente brillante, aunque no seas un fan de warhammer 40k y vengas a buscar tiros, la historia y como se va desarrollando de cara al final es exquisito, el poder vivir las conversaciones del capitulo entre soldados, la nave, su jerarquía, el resto de facciones que aparecen, personajes excelentemente bien definidos y maduros (en esta epoca woke de agenda 2030 donde todos son adolescentes y los hombres no son hombres es extraño, por eso hay que recalcarlo). No esperes nada más, acción a raudales como cualquier Gears of War lo fue en su momento y a disfrutar como un enano.

Gráficos:
Espectacular es quedarse corto, a medida que avanza la historia y las particulas van tomando más papel, la experiencia de cada nivel va en aumento. Los tiranidos son geniales y las misiones contra ellos también, pero de cara a la mitad/final toma otro concepto. Además el poder vivir la batalla en pleno terreno con los astra militarum y el resto del capítulo es increible. Super inmersivo.

Jugabilidad:
Aquí es donde puede fallar, SM2 el juego te introduce la idea de jugar en difícil y con los 4 tips que te dan de forma bastante regular hace que sea muy frustrante, cuesta mucho pillarle el tranquillo al juego y saber cuando defenderte de los 4 tiros que te pegan y te dejan en el suelo. Pero admito que de cara a la mitad cuando ya podía entender como jugarlo empecé a disfrutar muchisimo. No te esperes una nueva invención, pero dentro de su simplicidad es justo lo que vienes buscando, acción, tiros y matar tropecientos enemigos.

Nada de agenda politica feminista en el juego. Los hombres son hombres, las mujeres mujeres y la historia se centra en eso: Warhammer 40k, no de quién es mejor que otro o como un género se cree otro. Es como eran los juegos hace 5 años antes de toda la agenda política. Aquí te puedes sentar y DISFRUTAR de una aventura de acción.

Kroma,0,91.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Chroma159/,"First of all i did enjoy playing this game and still enjoy it, but it'sa ""fun with friends"" game.
My Biggest cons with this game is the fact that parry and dodge is sometimes very unresponsive.
the dodge indicator shows up got disappears before the enemy has even done the attack, leaving you clueless to when to actually time it correctly. Same goes for the parry indicator.

Campaign is about 10-12hrs give or take (at least it's twice as long as the first game).

The Multi player Pve missions are fun and tie in well with the Campaigns story.

Season Pass for 40€, you wot m8?

Never tried the PVP, but i'm not a pvp player and it looked just like the first games PVP.

Now should you buy this game?
If you really really enjoy the story of the Ultramarine Titus, then yeah sure buy it.
If you really enjoy Left 4 Dead playstyle games, Then yeah sure buy it.
BUT I would storngly urge you to buy it on a big sale, I got 16hrs out the game after doing 4 PvE missions, and the campaign on Angel of Death difficulty. It isn't value for money unless you buy the game for the PvE and PvP mode.

Game does look stunning and it's very much a game with space marines it it, albeeit they feel like snails compared to what they really are, i mean primaris marines are normal marines but better and they move as if they are walking through a giant block of gelatinous slime",2024/9/11,en

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – A Brutal War in the Grim Darkness of the Future! (ฅ'ω'ฅ)

""An exhilarating, gory, and action-packed sequel that lives up to the scale of the Warhammer 40K universe, but with some notable flaws in balance and technical polish.""


Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 thrusts players into the brutal and unrelenting world of the Warhammer 40K universe, continuing the tale of the Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. Developed by Saber Interactive, this third-person action game places you in the superhuman armor of a Space Marine as you combat the horrifying Tyranid swarm in intense, blood-soaked battles. Building on the success of its predecessor, Space Marine 2 offers solo and co-op gameplay, featuring both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes to keep the action fresh and chaotic.


The moment you step into Titus' power armor, the scale of Space Marine 2’s combat becomes apparent. The game’s standout feature is its seamless combination of gunplay and melee combat, allowing players to switch between devastating bolter shots and brutal close-quarters executions. The spectacle of mowing down endless Tyranid swarms is both thrilling and terrifying, thanks to the sheer number of enemies onscreen, powered by Saber’s Swarm Engine.

The visuals are equally impressive, capturing the grim, gothic aesthetic of the 40K universe. From the ruined hive cities to the expansive battlefields littered with the corpses of xenos and humans alike, the game never shies away from its dark atmosphere. The orchestral score and guttural sounds of bolters firing and chainswords revving heighten the sense of chaos, making every battle feel cinematic.

However, the combat system, while exhilarating, does suffer from balance issues. Melee attacks dominate the battlefield, often making ranged weapons feel underpowered, particularly when faced with larger enemies. The tactical depth you'd expect from wielding the mighty bolter or plasma gun is somewhat diminished by their lack of punch, especially when it inexplicably takes a full magazine to down a basic Tyranid warrior. This can lead to frustrating moments, especially for players who prefer a ranged combat style.

The co-op and PvP modes are a welcome addition, extending the game’s replayability. Operations, the co-op missions, allow players to team up with friends to tackle harder challenges, but the real test comes in the PvP mode, Eternal War, where teams of Space Marines face off against the forces of Chaos. Both modes offer progression systems with plenty of unlockable perks and cosmetics, though the limited variety in mission design can make long play sessions feel repetitive.













Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers on its promise of fast, bloody, and exhilarating combat in the vast and unforgiving Warhammer 40K universe. The game’s atmospheric design, gripping story, and expansive multiplayer modes make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and action games alike. However, the imbalance between melee and ranged combat, along with some technical glitches, prevent it from reaching its full potential.

For those who love diving into the lore of Warhammer or who are looking for a gory, action-packed co-op experience, Space Marine 2 is a solid recommendation. Just don’t expect a perfectly polished experience or to rely heavily on your bolter.

呱！好劲口牙！

阔别13年，再次跟随 泰爷爷的脚步 体验让每个40K人下体湿湿 的 终极体验吧！！

获得免费升级
手撕虫虫！！
在城里溜圈，围观斗蛐蛐
狂挤番茄酱！！
各种建筑爆破

领导亲自带头做项目，与你互通有无
在庆功宴上走上人生巅峰！！

在新世代的画面加持下，这一份40K的战场震撼独此一家，在众多一言难尽的40K游戏里也算是拔尖的了

但是 为什么 是 不推荐咧？

因为我玩了 死亡天使 难度 以及 对于游戏一些设计的不解

单人游戏中：
臭名昭著的电梯守4链条就不说了 还能说是对于你杀敌效率有一定要求 要灵活运用场景资源过关 用榴弹爆弹枪直接榴弹轰链条还是可以马上清掉翼虫的

但是机械教资料库开发电机 我就不太能理解了场景需要你使用喷火器驱逐撕裂虫 同时开启发动机并且守护一段时间
ok 但是为什么会在需要时刻用短手远程保持环境安全的情况下 设置需要长手远程才能处理的脑虫？

手枪可以管 ok 但是 死亡天使 难度导致 脑虫肉肉 不换大枪打的话 在4，5只近远程武士虫和2，30只刀虫对你蓝圈红圈的猛攻下手枪几乎无法在不瞄准的情况下把脑虫打到红温

ok 那我能不能先高效清理地面然后再干脑虫咧？ 但是 死亡天使 难度 导致 所有虫虫肉肉 普通双刀武士虫 也需要两套连招或者两个枪决才能打出红温 同时还要时刻注意地上的小蝌蚪

喷火器能不能虫虫烧烤呢？ 可以捏 但是火太亮了， 看不清蓝圈红圈， 只能和虫虫互相欧拉了， 一不小心就被在天上狂放红圈的卑鄙虫虫给滋死了

那就换大枪吧。。。为什么捡枪要有1.5秒的确认圈圈。。。什么血包也要1.5秒？。。。手雷也要。。。明明 子弹就是瞬间拿的。。。

最后自己红温了，狂拍手雷技能打药回血发电机秦王绕柱AI引怪不停猥琐手枪射击，在人极度愤怒的情况下，过了。
感觉核心问题是 死亡天使 难度下， 似乎虫虫变肉了。老兵难度下武士虫1个枪决加2，3刀（1套半连招）便能红温 而死亡天使 则需要2个枪决加2，3刀（两套半连招）才能红温

而我们的泰爷爷从头到尾无论是老兵还是死亡天使都用着他那平平无奇的3+爆弹枪（其他武器也是都是基础值），导致低难度是爆弹枪 高难度是滋水枪。而战役过程中没有任何的升级内容，导致即使与最终boss决斗时泰爷爷用的还是白板数值的爆弹枪，不愧为传奇蓝精灵。

多人游戏PVE中：
“哎呀哎呀 这游戏单人就是走个过场撑个牌面 爽就完了 干嘛纠结这个呀” 对 你说的没有错 我认为这个游戏的情怀G点在单人而游戏性亮点就在多人！我只尝试了PVE，故PVP暂不做评论。

看得出制作组花了大精力打造了6个职业 每个职业近20种特性 近二十把武器每把武器更是有多样变种以及升级，颇有暗潮的感觉。 任务皆为剧情中给泰爷爷打下手的副队行动，和剧情一样4个难度。看了武器的升级选项，原来泰爷爷的3+爆弹枪最后可以变成9+，怪不得 死亡天使 难度这么难 原来最精锐的蓝精灵全在主战场外（红温了）

3个近战职业（狂战，刺客，坦克）3个远程职业（步枪，狙，机枪哥）每个职业换着玩也是能体验到各种乐趣 泰爷爷是啥？泰爷爷职业就是爷，爷开技能能回血！

但是游戏的一些设定始终让我有点摸不着头脑：
生命值回复：似乎游戏中并没有各类PVE游戏中存在的休息站，只有换装备的武器站，地图里也只有寥寥无几的血包需要在三个蓝精灵之间分配，导致血量在任务中会越打越少。除了少数职业有“在XX情况下回复1%血量”或者“30%血量下，只要XX就能恢复5%血量”这种回血的天赋，大多数人只能靠倒了拉起和死了重生来恢复自己的状态。特别在高难度合作下的确是个问题。

护盾值：明显制作组希望玩家多打枪决，多打处决来回盾以此减少对血条的压力，虽然处决是有无敌时间的，但是 似乎 好像 枪决 是会被红圈攻击打断的。处决动画是很帅啦但是也满长的，比如说虫虫红温了我是机枪哥我可能跟倾向于直接继续扫，继续多扫两枪出枪决标了，1枪秒了，接着扫别的虫虫。 感觉在实战中大多数人差不多也是团战快打完了才会挑红温的虫虫回状态，我觉得更好的情况是，精英虫和刀虫处决一样 1秒到2秒这样或许会对于近战职业更加友好。

捡东西：1.5秒，为什么？补弹药？Ok的，回满状态，有点小惩罚，理解。枪？怕拿错枪，好吧。手雷？是怕我换错手雷嘛。血包？怕我多拿血包？一般性设计等待圈是因为物品有多种用途或者和别的行为按键冲突，或者是物品重叠，又或者是重要抉择关键物品。残血一路刺激溜虫好不容易看见了个血包&手雷结果不能路过捡起（红温了）

敌人提示：背后出现红圈提示，你猜是啥。是武士虫十字斩我，还是脑虫朝我丢粑粑，还是蛇虫刺我屁屁还是刀斧虫要来扑倒我了。 脑虫粑粑丢两下，可能还是射线要延迟躲。唯一能被认出来的只有狙击虫的射线。这还未涉及到混沌部分。辨别场上有哪些精英全靠好人队友标点，特别是泰伦一家子在一团一起冲过来，光武士虫就4个变体，真的没法立马认出来，更不用说背后偷袭的卑鄙小人了。暗潮好歹还给精英上个大绿夜视仪头上插点图腾，说点骚话让你有逼数。这一团白白紫紫张牙舞爪的也没啥特殊音效，3，4个武士虫混个蛇虫被插才知道。

人群控制：清群溜怪，PVE经典桥段。有没有懂哥说一下？ 我感觉似乎就是靠近战哥吸怪，两人狂射，近战哥处决回盾这么个循环。 一旦近战哥拖不住了，而似乎也没有职业拥有嘲讽，推击，阻拦类似的技能，远程哥压力大增。清群武器就大锤和充能动力剑，接着就是机枪，热熔。地图大多开阔地少有走廊房间隘口等能集力绞杀的地点。

然后 6张图，这么多职业，这么多武器，就一个字，肝。暗潮肝4个探员，这里有六个蓝精灵！！但是没有武器词条，天赋也较多为角色被动而不与武器相连，很难想象满级后能有什么动力继续刷。

说了这么多给了个不推荐，因为感觉就现在内容似乎一眼望到头，但是心里也是希望这个游戏能做好的。40K著以出粪游闻名，这几年风向转好但出的游戏也是史味巧克力或者巧克力味史。但是随着行商浪人的出版和9月9忆战斗兄弟的好评反响，马上暗潮月底也要更新武器系统，难道40K人的好日子要来力嘛？
最后希望saber组好好开发，多出图，多出有特色有识别度的敌人，能使玩家开发有趣玩法的天赋，以及我上面所述的一些问题。。求求你改了吧。。。或者有无懂哥让我明白一下到底为啥这么设计。

谢谢大家

CAMPAIGN

Great, better than the first games in every way, but. A a few gripes of mine, for starters. If you've progressed through the campaign & you weren't the party leader with friends, none of your progress is saved. Your campaign progress is tied to whoever was the party leaders.

So if you want to replay specific missions you would of had to of been the party leader yourself, otherwise you can't play them.

So if you want to continue where you left off, you have to plan it accordingly with your friends and have the same party leader, (harder if you're all in your 30's with jobs and families) or play it all over again solo or as the party leader with a new batch of friends.

Vehicles? Turrets? Anything? Nope. All infantry combat, which is fine, but it felt like a cop out. You're even teased with a tank in one mission, and all it is, is a in game cutscene from A to B, nothing more.

Speaking of cutscenes, although beautifully made, a good chunk of the gameplay is just that.... pre-rendered or in game cutscenes.

Lack of the variety of enemies. There should of been more variants. Once you start going through missions combat sadly starts feeling the same unless a certain point in the game a new enemy is added into the mix for plot/campaign status. But then it quickly looses it's excitement when it just falls in line with everything else and just becomes the norm again.

However despite those gripes, i thoroughly enjoyed it. There is also replay-ability value there if you fancy a go at all three of the main characters of your squad with their different unique abilities. 8/10


CO-OP Missions

I like how they have been designed. They are aligned with the main campaign. They focus on a different squad of AI/characters related to the story that do their plot/story progression on the side unseen from the main campaign. But this time you get to play them. And knowing how certain events happened and why from the eyes of this new squad is a nice touch of story telling.

The added bonus to it is you have a lot more freedom of choice, you have all 6 classes to choose from, play around with, customise and level up. Everything weapons wise is unlocked from the get go so freedom of choice / chance to experiment isn't locked behind a levelling tree.

What you do unlock however is customisation and upgrades for your weapons/gear.

Is the co-op fun? Yes. Is it a bit of a slug fest after you complete the full set of missions based/linked to the campaign? That totally depends on what you personally like. I enjoyed myself, but I don't see myself really ever replaying them again other than to play with friends for a nice chill sesh.

If grinding away against endless hordes of AI is your thing. With games such as Darktide, then this is right up your ally. I've already sunk enough hours into Darktide however to do it all over again. 7/10

Eternal War (PVP)

This is personally my favourite aspect of the game, despite it's current bare bones structure. Levelling and unlocking is accustomed to the usual stuff you see in games such as Call of Duty, level up, unlock new gun, new item, new gear, play away.

It is however a lot more grindier to gain XP and points for skins/customisation items then it's CO-OP counterpart. Which can be challenging for some but rewarding for others.

There are already some very overly powered meta's in game, if you're going against high levels and a majority of your team is low levels, you're going to 9/10 have a very bad time.

Only 3 maps, all that a custom to the three game modes.

Annihilation (Team Deathmatch)
Seize Ground (Domination)
Capture & Control (King of the Hill)

With the three maps, map knowledge is essentially an advantage at this point if you've played longer than others. Their design, look and feel is very symmetrical, it extremely reminds me of Gears of War 1, 2 & 3's Multiplayer Map Design. There are no advantages to which team/spawn you're on, everything spawn and level design wise is balanced.


All in all very fun, challenging but rewarding. 9/10

Galactic Conquest like mode for CO-OP & PVP Events (from the OG Battlefronts)

Make Tyranids a playable faction in PVP

Key factor for this review) So the date of release comes around and i boot up and dive in. I'm going to keep this short and to the point. The Campaign was absolutely amazing, the scenes of battle and fighting through battlefields was amazing and immensely fun. They really captured the feel of 40k with every mission. Superb.... Roughly 8-9 hours later.... Story finished.... And honestly i cant give any reason to come back to this game after finishing the campaign. I had built up in my head that they were going to go down the Hell Divers route with this game and open it up a bit, really expand on the online social aspect of it. But they never. Its a very linear short story which is great mind you. Cant fault the gameplay and story at all. its Space Marine 1 improved, not expanded and that's my problem with it. There are like... 6-8 online operations that you can play as a team online with 2 other players and you can play those over and over again i suppose if you want to unlock different armors etc.... but to what end? To play through the same 6 missions with new armor? There is the online but like Space Marine 1, i just cant recommend it at all. Played one match and noped out of there. Does a linear story at 8 hours long survive in today's climate? I'm not sure. But i would be lying if i said i wasn't disappointed that i'm essentially just uninstalling this game after playing it for 8 hours. Though those 8 hours were fun and very well put together story wise. If you're fine with a linear 8 hour story with some side content sprinkled in to top it off then i would say go for it. If you were hoping for more to get engaged with and dive in deeper, i just cant justify getting it for the price. Its Space Marine improved.... Not expanded.",2024/9/7,en

Bottom line is difficulty needs heavy tweaking or there has to be an economy added for armory data/requisition.

If you are not into ball busting difficulty (like inferno on diablo 3 release), but want to progress and not satisfied with PVP and Campaign offerings don't buy it.
Operations higher difficulty is a mess.


Update: I am now farming ruthless consistently so don't mind the last couple of pharagrahs.

Valhorren,1,90.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Valhorren/,"Лень расписывать плюсы и минусы, поэтому будут чистые эмоции - это экстаз.
Для фана вахи это абсолютный мастхэв, это тот самый ААА проект который мы столько лет ждали, постановка, сюжет, знаковые персонажи - просто сидишь и визжишь как ребенок. Эпик только увеличивается с каждой миссией и в целом компания идет столько сколько нужно. Куча крутых постановочных сцен, невероятно красивые и детализированные локации - это просто какой-то праздник пафоса и восхищения.

Обычно после прохождения на свежую голову начинаешь выискивать минусы, но тут я просто объективно их почти не вижу, кроме не слишком сбалансированной боевки, где ты в секунду теряешь все хп и без кооператива тащить ласт сложности просто анрил. Но в целом боевка классная, ей буквально не хватает 10-20% шлифовки чтобы можно было всегда тащить на скиле, ибо порой врагов столько, что не успеваешь уклониться, спарировать и плюс нельзя отменять анимации, что тоже порой заставляет получить оплеуху. Но в целом за всю компанию я ни разу не почувствовал чувство духоты и того что я хочу все дропнуть.

Единственное возвращаясь к сложности, я задушился играть на 3 и стал на 2 и даже там видны проблемы баланса, оно не сильно портит впечатления игры именно на 2 сложности, все что выше это не сбалансированный ад, который надо будет исправлять, если бы я пытался пройти все на них, то скорее всего небезосновательно крыл бы матом разрабов как большая часть отрицательных обзоров, так что надеюсь что после полного релиза разработчики как-то это подправят патчами, иначе это неиграбельно.

В общем это на текущий момент самая крутая, масштабная игра по вахе, ее в обязательном порядке должен пройти каждый фанат, и обычный игрок тоже может получить удовольствие и мб даже вкатиться.

I really like this game it feels great to play and am happy a road map was already shown to address many issues. Though I have a few things I wish they would add and change.

Changes:
- It does not make sense to have operations and pvp not transfer your level in between each other. If I grind my level in operations my level should be the same for pvp so that I can access all the weapons I grinded for.
- make it easier to level up
- Add another class like tech marine, apothecary, chaplain
- Make it so that heretic astartes are not locked in to only 1 class

Additions:
- For pvp they should add execution kills to make the game cooler
- Add a parry mechanic because melee against character feels just like who hits first gurantees a win.
- Buff the assault class it is definitely the weakest class overall. Make the animations fast , maybe give it a stun when it slams in the air and more armor so it does not instantly die and add lightning claws.
- Add more voice lines for the narration and the characters its annoying only hearing the same phrases over and over
- Give the heretic astartes more customization options as it is a bit disappointing that you can only change their color
- add more traitor legions like emperors children, wordbearers, sons of horus, and Thousand sons
- give loyalist unique voicelines for loyalist legions as it was done for heretics
- Add more enemies from different chaos factions other than Tzeetch.

Judge Cudge,0,6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012825255/,"You do not feel like a Space Marine in this game.

In singleplayer PVE on just veteran difficulty, which is supposedly the intended experience, even (close to) perfect play rewards you with gameplay of being constantly whittled down by weenies into flickeringly low hp when reacting to all commands perfectly and swiftly headshotting and executing every enemy whilst never being hit by even a single clean attack from anything other than explicitly and only small enemies hitting you during your own melee attack combos on larger ones.

Why is the game this way?
Even supposing this is somehow balanced around multiplayer, the mindset that somehow your hypervulnerability is the right way to accomplish this is just incorrect.

This isn't left for darktide (tm) where teamwork needs to be clumsily reinforced by having insta downs/squishiness that let people pretend they are helping eachother in the most hamfisted design decision of all time.

We are walking super human tankmen fighting bugs, and the intended gameplay experience leaves you scrambling for medicae at all times.

I win every time, but I never once feel cool or strong, and further because I am so limited on HP and ammo my reactions are all on rails.
I ALWAYS have to go for the gun reaction post parry.
I ALWAYS have to go for a cutscene execute to gain armor.
I ALWAYS have burn grenades at swarm pillars cascading up walls.
I ALWAYS pick up and use the 'use here' guns like the flamethrower.
I ALWAYS use my super mode on cooldown to scrounge HP.

I feel like a pathetically weak and clunky man walking through a giant quick time event.

Why did they do this? How is being a paper mache weakling who is forbidden from making gameplay decisions the 'intended experience'?

I want to feel like a space marine.
Unless there are changes, the game fails at what is supposed to make it compelling, though it is undoubtedly beautiful and cool looking.",2024/9/11,en

Рекомендую с большой натяжкой для прохождения с друзьями.

У игры есть один большой плюс - половину времени ощущаешь себя в эпицентре блокбастера. Много жирного густого экшена с полчищами врагов. Вау-эффект гарантирован.

А минусов много:

1. Игра раздражает. Одновременно тебе нужно защищать несколько объектов в разных концах базы. Датчики тебе подают сигнал, что нужно прямо сейчас парировать атаки. А тебе не до этого. В эту же секунду оператор нервно орет на тебя, что горгульи повредили антенну. А тебе еще сию секунду нужно очень медленно перезаряжаться, пока тебя жрут жуки. И делать это надо где-то каждые пять секунд.

2. Сразу не понравилась стрельба. Она тут ощущается не так прикольно, как, например, в Destiny, или Hell divers 2. Как-то ничего особенного.

3. Вместо боевого танца - неуклюжая неразбериха. Это если вы, как я, с трудом совмещаете 3d экшен c Dark souls - да, тут регулярно надо кувыркаться и парировать атаки. Как же это надоело...

4. Мультяшность качков-героев можно простить. Но всерьез игру воспринимать сложней.

5. Много невидимых стен.

А еще игра зависает при выходе.

Совершенно проходной сюжет к минусам даже не отношу, он тут для галочки. И уравновешивается в целом качественной графикой.",2024/9/11,ru
Кайса Клауд,1,88.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199062289290/,"НИ КОПЕЙКИ НЕ ЖАЛКО!

Основываясь на личных субъективных впечатлений от первых трёх часов игры - АХ*ЕННО! Когда только увидела тизер на TGA, я пищала от восторга, поскольку действительно годных игр по вахе в последнее время крайне мало, а тут нам показали прямо-таки концентрат брутализма, пафоса и мрачности. Всё по заветам Императора. Так вот, решила впервые в жизни раскошелиться на предзаказ самого полного ультра издания. Это влетело мне в копеечку, но какого хрена, один раз живём. И в предвкушении поставила на скачку. А затем поняла, что я наивная дурочка, которая на радостях забыла сравнить системные требования со своим ведром.

- для понимания: видеокарта Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, процессор Intel Core i5-9400F, RAM - 16 ГБ.

Если видюха ещё вполне справится с минималками, то вот процессор не дотягивает даже до этого. Я уже готова была молиться всем богам, чтобы игра хоть как-то пошла, хоть на каких настройках. С появлением первых отзывов надежд, что она у меня вообще запустится было всё меньше, а когда люди с куда более производительным железом писали, что даже у них игра лагает, тормозит и вылетает - мои шансы и вовсе стремились к нулю. ОДНАКО, я всё же рискнула и запустила. Первый запуск был довольно долгим, и начальный ролик по какой-то причине заглючил и пропустил половину катсцены. Но как только начался геймплей всё нормализовалось. Настройки я выставила средне-низкие и внимательно следила за температурой процессора. К моему удивлению, старичок прекрасно справлялся даже в самых масштабных баталиях, не греясь выше 65-70 градусов и выдавая стабильные 30 FPS. Картинка была достаточно плавная, без фризов и пролагиваний, графика более чем приятная даже на таких настройках. Все последующие кат-сцены шли без огрехов (единственное что в паре мест звук немного отставал от картинки).
Что касается самого геймплея - чистый восторг (ну, лично для меня)! Выбрала сложность Ветеран, чтобы превозмогать, как и положено. И, ожидаемо, мне напихали ещё в прологе по самое небалуйся)) Но стоило привыкнуть ко всем возможным действиям и уже прожимаешь нужные кнопки не задумываясь. Динамика боя просто бомбическая! Сколько раз я выходила из боя победителем с каким-то миллиметров хр, столько же раз я и отхватывала смертельных люлей. Оружие стреляет мощно и сочно, вариантов разных пушек хватает и каждая ощущается вроде похоже, но всё же по-разному. Космодесантник действительно чувствуется тяжеленной машиной смерти даже при простом передвижении, но он всё же не бессмертен и если бездумно кинуться в толпу в надежде затыкать мелкую шушеру цепным мечом - его разорвут за полминуты.
В игре отличное звуковое оформление. Окружение шумит и бахает так, что от звуков выстрела того же тяжёлого болтера (особенно в наушниках) пробегают табуны мурашек по спине. Также удобно ориентироваться на звук готовящейся парируемой и непарируемой атаки, так что даже если в гуще боя ты не видишь противника, то звук даст знать, когда прожать блок/уклонение.
Про визуал даже говорить нечего - полный восторг!
Я слышала про проблемы с сетевой игрой, но уверена, разработчики оперативно всё пофиксят. Игра сделана с огромной любовью ко вселенной и я уверена, что людям, создавшим её далеко не наплевать на свой проект. Поэтому нужно лишь немного подождать и всё разрешится.
Ни разу не жалею за покупку полного предзаказа, ибо занести денюшку на такую шикарнорсть благое дело)
Буду играть дальше, возможно потом дополню отзыв, если вылезут какие-то проблемы или наоборот, поделюсь уже полными впечатлениями. А теперь пойду возносить молитвы Духу Машины моего ПК за то, что он такой молодец))

Апдейт: Окей, есть ложка дёгтя в кастрюле супа. ИИ напарников мог бы быть чуть получше. Приказы им отдавать не получается, как в том же Mass Effect например, врагов не добивают (разве что очень редко), гранаты не кидают (ну или я этого не замечала) и, по факту, они представляют из себя такие передвижные турельки, которые могут слегка отвлечь на себя врага и поднять тебя, если xp обнулится. В целом, на Ветеране даже так проходить норм, челендж есть, но не душный (кроме чёртовых уровней с обороной антенн и цепей), и соответственно эмоциональная отдача от победы в тяжкой битве. Но всё время такое чувство, что ты тупо один всё вывозишь, напарники не ощущаются напарниками. Не сказать, чтоб это как-то сильно портило веселье, но будь они чуть поактивнее, было бы куда бодрее)

Снова апдейт: Хмм, удивительное дело, но как будто с напарниками стало получше, ульты пользуют почаще и даже вроде ставят приоритетом основную цель задания, а не беспорядочное крошево врагов. Видимо, пофиксили.

Ещё один апдейт: Прошла сюжет, градус эпика и пафоса ближе к концу повышался до почти неприличных значений) Да, сюжет прост как две копейки с парочкой небольших вотэтоповоротов, которые знакомым с вахой людьми угадывается на раз. Но в этом есть какое-то своё очарование. Сейчас многие игры и фильмы всё время пытаются завернуть сюжетные тропы в какой-то гибрид морского узла и прошлогодней ёлочной гирлянды, распутывать которые уже просто устаёшь. И вот как же порой не хватает простого и прямолинейного злого зла и доброго добра (не кидайтесь тапками, я в курсе, что в вахе каждая из фракций те ещё ублюдки :). В данном случае тех же тиранидов и бравых космодесантников. Когда ты не терзаешься в сложных душевных метаниях и не плутаешь в серых зонах морали, а просто прёшь напролом с чёткой целью без колебаний стереть с лица галактики всё, что подпадает под определение ""зла"". Мне очень понравилось и я испытала подлинное удовольствие от игры. Теперь осталось подождать патча на починку сетевого кода и с двух ног врываться в кооператив)

Что хотелось бы ещё от разработчиков, чтобы они где-нибудь в меню добавили кнопку, позволяющую сразу переключиться в оффлайн режим. Поскольку у меня при прохождении сюжета при переходе в новый сегмент главы порой терялась связь с сервером и даже когда я нажимала продолжить оффлайн, меня отбрасывало на приличный кусок главы назад и приходилось перепроходить (так было примерно 2 раза за игру, в остальных случаях потери соединения игра спокойно шла дальше, только в оффлайн режиме).",2024/9/8,ru
Shinigami-Sama,1,40.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130967517/,"Having just finished the game i am of two minds about it:

The Good: It builds on the first game and does a great job of making you feel like a space marine. Your powerful and hit like a truck, it is friendly to the lore and brings the world of 40k to life. I have seen some reviews talking about the first half of the game being the worst part and i have to disagree. The first half of the game defending worlds from tyranids is amazing and exciting. Watching a whole swarm descend on a guarded position as you, your brothers and the scared guardsmen hold the line is great.

And now here is where the bad comes in:

The second half of the game feels like a rehash of the first game. It feels like they just wanted to have you fight chaos for pretty much no reason other than you did it in the first game. This is a issue as it left me wanting more, you just seemingly wipe the nids and chase chaos and to me this was boring. When they showed there would be three worlds to fight on i was expecting a long story where i am jumping from world to world dealing with its attackers and i feel this is what saber should have done. It should have been you fighting the nids on one world whilst chaos attacks another and a 3rd faction the other and then have them merge. But instead its simply hey you seemingly dealt with the nids now go fight chaos for the last act.

Overall i recommend it if you are a fan of 40k or the first game as it does fill the need of 40k fun and that fun from the first game. Just dont expect it to fill you at the current moment roughly 2 days of playing and i have finished the story on veteran i expected more saber.

You don’t play as a Space Marine — you ascend to one, crushing heretics and xenos alike with the elegance of a chainsword tearing through alien flesh.

The setting? A masterpiece of gothic despair, where every ruin and skull (so many skulls!) reminds you that the galaxy hates you — and you're here to hate it right back. Tyranids swarm like they own the place (spoiler: they don’t), and Chaos whispers temptations you answer with righteous ultraviolence.

Graphics? So good it’s practically a heretical experience. My PC now has a Machine Spirit that groans every time I boot it up. Gameplay? It’s like the Codex Astartes came to life and gave you a chainsword, saying, “Go forth and do the Emperor’s work.”

Flaws? Just one: I can’t shout FOR THE EMPEROR loud enough to match the carnage on-screen. But that’s not the game’s fault — that’s on me.

Additionally the TE-style red/blue rings for dodges and parrys ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ suck. It feels like a duck tape solution to their wanting to implement dark souls-esque timing requiments while filling the screen with swarms of enemies. It becomes and annoying indecipherable mess.

It tells the story of how three and a half ultramarines defeated just a few million tyrranids and chaos followers. Again attached lobotomized psyker, chaos-thermo-lord-wizard, references to Lord of the Rings and, unlike the first part, not fapable IG girl.
This game, apparently, enough money, so we have:
The scenery in the game is exactly three kinds again: ruins in swamps, city, cemetery in the ruins. The only glimmer of light at the very end: the ruins of cemetery in a warp anomaly.
Enemies are also of three types: tyranids, chaosites, and demon. Though for each type are drawn special, pathos-busting animations of knocking out heresy.
Weapons compared to the tabletop redesigned just to the point of impossibility: from melta made shotgun, from laska sniper, from stormbolter dull machine gun, and from the jumping satchel evil machine unstoppable imba. And they didn't let me dabble in heavy weapons

1)The game presents genetically enhanced superhuman warriors as ordinary overgrown men in sealed lats.
2)Almost the entire game, while in the combat zone, the protagonists walk around without helmets (Strictly forbidden by the Codex Astartes). The phrase of the captain (!) of the Ultramarines (!!!) addressed to the sergeant “Why do you take the Codex Astartes so seriously?” is tantamount to breaking the oath of some Creed regiment.
3)The aforementioned captain, fighting with weapons the average SM would be ashamed of, in armor less flashy than the sergeant next to him.

Последняя игрушка по 40к, получившая кучу положительных оценок ещё до выхода. Повествует о том, как три с половиной ультрамарина победили всего-то несколько миллионов тирранидов и хаоситов. Опять прилагается лоботомированный псайкер, хаос-термо-лорд-волшебник, отсылки к Властелину Колец и, в отличии от первой части, не фапабельная ИГшница. Тем не менее, бабло на игру, видимо, хватило, в отличии от первой части, благодаря чему:

Декораций в игре ровно опять три вида: руины в болотах, город, кладбище в руинах. Единственный проблеск света в самом конце: руины кладбища в варп-аномалии.
Врагов тоже три вида: тираниды, хаоситы, демон. Хотя для каждого типа прорисованы особые, пафосные анимации вышибания ереси.
Оружие по сравнению с настолкой переработано просто донельзя: из мелты сделали дробовик, из лазки снайперку, из штормболтера унылый пулемет, а из прыжкового ранца злобную машину неостановимой имбы. И не дали побаловаться тяжелым оружием

Игра преподносит генетически улучшенных воинов-сверхлюдей, как обычных мужиков-переростков в герметичных латах.
Практически всю игру, находясь в зоне боевых действий, главные герои ходят без шлемов (Строжайше запрещено Кодексом Астартес). Фраза капитана (!) Ультрамаринов (!!!), обращённая к сержанту «А чего ты так серьёзно относишься к Кодексу Астартес?» равносильна нарушению присяги каким-нибудь кридским полком.
Упомянутый капитан, воюющий с оружием, которого постыдился бы и обычный десантник, в доспехе менее пафосном чем у сержанта рядом.

Game's visual aspect looks great, especially considering the absolute chaos you see happening on the screen with so many enemies swarming and things blowing up, with even small attention to detail existing such as the fact you get mud stains on your armour (and blood ofc) as you go through some of the marshy parts of the planet, it looks damn good but due to performance being somewhat shoddy, up scaling is needed which softens the image so people who can't stand temporal softness to an image will not be happy

Optimizaiton








I played through it solo on Veteran, my initial experience was a bit Luke-warm with the first few missions but it didn't take long for me to get more into it, especially since the campaign gets better as you progress it, early missions have this more frequent re-occurring issue that is present when you're playing solo, where certain segments feel like they're not meant for you to be on your own with the two AI partners that share a singular brain cell, such as for an example having to use a flame thrower to push back a swarm of tiny lil' insects whilst dealing with lots of ranged enemies and having to complete some objectives, problem is, the flamer takes you primary weapon away so all you're down to is your pistol for ranged enemies plus enemies in solo mode tend to focus more on the solo player than the two AI partners, so these situations can feel a bit bad . However , this starts becoming less so of a problem at the mid point of the campaign where it starts feeling like they put some more thought into making it more enjoyable when playing solo. The campaign as a whole is really damn good by the end, apart from some stumbles in design where it can very much feel like it's a Co-Op campaign with an optional solo mode from time to time, it's epic, doesn't over stay its welcome , ends on a pretty satisfying note with a spectacular final act fight that was incredibly kick a**.",2024/9/8,en

SiMBi0ZZA,0,14.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SiMBi0ZZA/,"ОБЗОР НАХОДИТСЯ В РАННЕМ ДОСТУПЕ ВЕРСИЯ 0.3v

На данный момент 6часов только в сюжетной компании игры.
При чём играла на пару с знакомым всё время после пролога.
Но даже игра в компании не спасла игру...
Обзор обновлю по мере освоения контента, а пока:
1) боевая система даже из того что заявлено крайне мало вариативности и контента имеет число огнестрела/комбо атак,
А к этому прибавьте то что из 5ти автоматом отличий нет ДЕ ФАКТО никаких.
Так же как и комбо не ощущаются как то по особому полное ощущение что кроме как пкм/пкм/пкм ничего и не нужно.
И ""узлов"" которые должны формировать ядро разнообразия мало, и того что есть по факту ещё меньше ибо смысла не имеет даже чисто из ""хочу"" не ощущается просто автомат 2 отличным от автомата 1 или автомата 3, ну нету отличий в ощущениях.
В прологе игра вас учит парировать и уклонятся а так же добивающим выстрелам соло цели, но тут же игра будет забрасывать толпами кидая всех врагов на вас без разбору не пытаясь в 88%ов случаев создавать из разных типов врагов и проектировки локаций интересные ситуации, запомнилась только локация где мы прятаясь за разрушаемыми статуями отстреливались от снайперов, это единственная интересная ситуация была на 6часов сюжетки (не прошли а наиграли)
типов врагов только 5 и 2 босса и так 5 часов до появления хаоситов, которые по сути рескины единственное отличие хаоситов то что большие мобы хаоса (космодесант хаоса) умеют телепортироваться, в остальном они идентичны своим аналогам у тиранидов.
В итоге миссии это череда 1нообразной каши из 5и типов врагов иногда появляются 1 из 2ух боссов всё.

Перечислять мелочи касательно недостатков боевой системы можно ещё долго не хватит символов обзора.

2) сюжета словно бы нет, тита не развивают, все персонажи помимо тита пустышки ни характера ни личности, никаких интересных диалогов или катсцен, химии между рядовым и титом в 1ой части когда они спорили на тему кодекса Астартес больше чем химии между титом и всеми персонажами 2ки вместе взятыми, и это не гипербола, просто в этой сцене в 1 химия была был конфликт который закладывал основу сюжета, а в 2ки просто нету ни сюжета ни диалогов ни какого то интереса к повествованию, драматургия не знакома разработчикам игры от слова совсем.
Даже когда были моменты когда ожидаешь максимально логичных тропов в рамках ситуации, их не было.
Такое ощущение что весь сюжет написала и срежиссировала нейросеть, и ещё раз ЭТО НЕ ГИПЕРБОЛА, это 1 в 1 так.

3) оптимизация у меня железо выше рекомендованных, я не сталкаш я не графодр()очер я поставила на низкие всю графику. у меня 2070super/i5 9600/16ram 3200. И при этом у меня фпс стабильно скачет от 40 до 60ти, и я понимаю те сцены где большая локация куча врагов и союзников, но почему в коридорных локациях падает фпс? на низких.
НИЗКИХ, моё железо 4 года назад было предтоповым считай особенно видяха, а тут игра которая ничем не выделяется на низких так падает в фпс, а местами фпс падал до 16цати, боюсь представить что будет за слайд шоу на минимальных указанных требованиях.

У меня есть ещё очень много что сказать но не поместиться в отзыв всё но основные претензии озвучила.

Если вы далеки от вахи и вам пофигу на канон, для вас это просто казуальная плохенькая игра с малой вариативностью и зевотным сюжетом.

Если вы довераст 20цатилетней выдержки как и я, кто имеет хотя бы 200часов подкастов прослушанных и чтения вики/кодексов, вам будет больно от бреда по бэку.

А если вы настольшик эксперт бэка, поберегите сердце, боюсь представить как больно будет вам.

НЕ покупайте игру за полный ценник, вы ничего не упускаете не поиграв в неё, эту игру брать меньше чем за 75%ов скидки не стоит, хотя даже так она не стоит денег, лучше переходите на импортозамещение.

А я продолжу играть ради создания видео обзора, буду страдать за вас... памагите Q...Q",2024/9/11,ru

LionSaurus,1,87,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005529409/,"Solid enough game - it does what it says on the tin - be a giant super human and smack bugs around. Story seems fun so far, operations are good (but with a caveat) and I like the melee and gunplay. After some more time in the game (both story and operation) I can delve a bit deeper into things.

Story - 7/10. It's pretty straight forward, though there might be a twist or turn in there (that I'm sure you have already gotten spoiled through various news media anyway). Not much to say. Simple, but cool.

World building - 10/10. Top marks. The maps, the battlefields, the chaos, the swarms, the absolute gore - it's just fantastic. It's beautiful and disturbing and just beyond anything I expected. Game teaches you about the 40k world and the immersion it provides gets you really stuck into it making you want to know more.

Gameplay - 9/10. Gameplay is marvelous. Though I'm still struggling with the timing of dodges and parries I've occasionally gotten in a flow where I just become a blender, chopping xeno scum to the left, doding xeno scum to the right, and firing of headshots as quick reaction. I for sure need to get better at the combat flow, but I can easily see how good it can be if you get good at it and once you do it's going to be euphoric.

Operations - 8/10, but with a caveat. The mainstay of the game in my opinion. It has huge potential and even the little I've played is so much fun. It reminds me of the golden days of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer (if you know, you know). However the biggest issue is playing without a full team - because you are stuck trying to connect with random players and that is it's own bag of worm. From people with bad connection, to people who won't go to the mission area, to people who just afk. I honestly prefer having bots over the random players, but unfortunately you can't choose to add bots - you have to hope nobody tries to join. The fact that we can't add bots makes me want to subtract 2 points from the score on it's own because the issues with random players can be very aggravating. They need to add an option to add bots..

Endless War - haven't played =p Might try it some day, but not a big PvP so - check others opinion on this game mode.

Would I recommend? I think, yes. If you enjoy the concept of loop gameplay from operations, and you have a full team (or the devs add option to add bots) I think you will have a blast. I know I will once I'm done with the random player issues.

Oh, and a final note. Stay away from the ultimate edition and cosmetic DLC's and all that. Even if you pay for it you still have to unlock it. So you buy for the right to unlock the cosmetics, but you still have to spend requisition on it which takes super long to grind. My biggest regret is paying for the ""cosmetic options"" I don't have enough points to unlock lol.",2024/9/7,en

Combat has weight and impact to it, the marines look good, the tyranids are relentless and the corridors and areas feel atmospheric. I mainly have small complaints like that bolters could have a little more punch to their sounds, blocking being a little confusing at the beginning and the menus being annoying to navigate with a controller as the cursor slows down A LOT on some UI elements but it sure does feel good to just have a game you can just play for fun without much modern nonsense in the way of just playing it. I'm also enjoying the photo mode.

I never expected a sequel to one of my guilty pleasure games but I'm so happy it exists! This game is such a huge improvement to the first one. The story was so fun and soooo sick. The addition of easy drop-in, drop-out for co-op was fantastic. Visuals were wayyy better than I expected and might be one of the nicest looking games I've ever played (at the time of this writing? lmao).
The only gripe I have is with the lack of information presented for pvp. It took quite a while to get into my first match and I had no idea if I was actually gonna get in since it gave me no indication besides ""Waiting for other Battle Brothers"" in a full lobby. Turns out I was waiting for the match that I joined to end... I think. It would also be nice to have one sentence explaining each of the pvp modes.

Shrimpy,1,94.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040086041/,"I Like it but thats not the whole story..
Space Marine 2 is well set in the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K. As a continuation of the OG Space Marine Game from 2011, it attempts to bring the one-decade old formula of bolter shooting and chainsawsword slashing to 2024. However, it struggles to do so and is very expensive on top. I really enjoy playing the game and will most likely cotinue to play it. But it has some notable flaws and if you are thinking about buying the game you should consider the following.


If you're a fan of Warhammer 40k and a sucker for the (totally not overrepresented) Ultra Marines, its a awesome implementation in the Universe.
The game is a well representation (even if a little generalized) of the lore and atmosphere that makes up the core of 40k for me. It allows you to stomp Tyranids and match yourself with . In the Coop PVE and the PVP mode, the Customization System allows you to tailor your Character into your favorite Space Marine Chapter or Chaos Legion. The Lovecraftian horrors of the 40k universe are well-represented, making the story engaging despite its somewhat bleak plot and dialogue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, if you're not deeply invested in the 40k Universe, Space Marine 2 falls short. The gameplay feels outdated, with clunky mechanics that haven't evolved much since the original game . Combat can be fun, but it's often repetitive and lacks the refinement seen in other smilar modern titles. The writing is another weak point, with dialogue that ranges from uninspired to outright poor. Online multiplayer is plagued by long wait times, frequent connection errors, and bugs that, for example, can make enemies invisible (very fun), breaking immersion and gameplay. The game has a very hard time to offer anything beyond its niche appeal, making its steep tag hard to justify for newcomers to the world of 40K aswell as casual players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Space Marine 2 delivers exactly what I want out of a Warhammer 40k game: a grimdark experience in a universe that lacks hope with the permanent thread of extinction for a human race lost in endless external and internal conflict. However, it struggles to appeal beyond its core audience due to outdated gameplay, technical issues, and blunt writing. If you're a diehard fan of 40k, you'll find enjoyment in this game despite its flaws. For everyone else, who just want to stomp some Aliens and blow up stuff, there are better and less expensive options.",2024/9/11,en

Si vous n’êtes pas un grand adepte de la saveur de la banane dans vos desserts, vous pouvez sauter cette étape, cela n’impactera pas la qualité de vos brioches.

Versez par-dessus les 120 g de yaourt grec, la farine, la levure et l’extrait de vanille. Si vos pépites de chocolat sont déjà préparées, versez-les également.

Sinon, coupez votre tablette en morceau à la main puis à l’aide d’un hachoir ou d’un gros couteau, réduisez-les en pépites. Plus celles-ci seront grosses, plus vous obtiendrez des morceaux de chocolat fondant dans vos brioches au moment de la cuisson.

Ajoutez-les ensuite à la préparation et mélangez le tout. Pétrissez la pâte obtenue dans vos mains et divisez-la ensuite en 4 petites boules.

Déposez ces boules sur une plaque allant au four recouverte de papier sulfurisé. Badigeonnez-les de jaune d’œuf à l’aide d’un pinceau.

Puis réalisez une petite entaille sur le dessus de chaque brioche pour une meilleure cuisson.

Autistic,1,11.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/seplim/,"Странная игра. И хорошая и плохая одновременно.

Отличительная черта любой игры для меня это геймплей и он здесь ниже среднего. Может быть потому что я играл на норме мне так показалось. Благо игра проходится за 10 часов максимум. Под конец, конечно, разгоняешься и ты уже по-ветерански быстро нажимаешь на квитайм нападки ксеносов и хаоситов, даже начинает нравится.

Но хотелось бы глубины: уникальные добивания, скиллы, пассивки, даже задания по типу убейте с боевого ножа 200 противников были бы в тему - всё таки 2024 год на дворе. А как многие заметили игра сделана по инструкциям 2010 года.

А вот что собственно хорошее в игре так это крутейшая постановка. Катсцены и ролики на должном уровне. История незатейлива и проста, но в тоже время способна увлечь.

Срежессировано так что погружаешься прям. Хочется орать в битве ""Во имя Императора!"", когда идешь вместе с астра милитарум в бой. С братьми журить адептус механикус за чванство.

Компаньоны - прописанные герои, а не болванчики, что радует. Прикипаешь к ним даже.

Сюжет моё почтение и старикам угодили, продолжив старую конву про артефакт. И с фанбазой заигрывают показывая тиранидов, боевую технику империума, хаоситов, некронские руины. И новичкам тоже вроде должно быть более менее понятно о чём речь. База - одним словом.

Мультик, ну он есть. А зачем? Ну тем кому недостаточно вахи в жизни, наверное.

В итоге: БРУТАЛЬНО, КРОВАВО, ЭПИЧНО. Рекомендую, но денег жалко. Не стоит она данной суммы, но когда видишь в титрах сплошь русские фамилии и cumis enjoer`а - уже и не жалко вроде. Говорю же: странно.",2024/9/9,ru

Justro,1,23.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slayerjustro666/,"This is by far my GOTY contender for 2024. I will not argue with people who don't agree for stupid reasons. The story is so stupidly incredible and epic. It fits perfectly for a Warhammer 40k game. The gameplay can at times be a little yanky and rough but is for the most part perfectly great and fun. Ripping a tyranid open from the middle and being drenched in its blood never gets old.

The operations game mode is so much fun, playing as my own space marine completing missions really is amazing. Even replaying the same missions doesn't get old.

The pvp game mode is the best pvp in any game I have ever played. I never liked playing pvp until I tried it in this game. However it is a bit unbalanced as some classes are absolute dogsh*t in pvp. Or at least on some gamemodes. I'm sure it will improve.

The customization is incredible, all that I am missing is more customization for heretic factions, which I don't doubt will come later considering how many people want it.

The only complaints for this game I have seen are: No widescreen support (Which will come to the game in september, just check the roadmap) , Oh I don't wanna connect to epic games services (Doesn't make the game bad, and is only there so you can play crossplay), The AI companions are so bad that I can't play the campaign solo (Literally a skill issue???)
This is finally a game that is not pay to win and it is clear that the devs reallly care about the game. In my eyes this game is joining baldurs gate 3 for being an actually good game in modern times. Yes some cosmetics will cost money, but all other content coming to the game is free. So people need to stop complaining about this game, because it is simply breathtaking.

In summary, this game is worth every penny. I bought Ultra Edition instead of Gold Edition even if it only gives me a cool cosmetic for Ultramarines (and I really dislike ultramarines) but I still don't regret it. I would have bought this game if it cost $150 base edition. Good that it doesn't but still, It is worth the money to me personally. Now keep in mind, I love warhammer 40k and have done for a while so I am a bit biased. But for a Warhammer 40k fan, this game is like the game of my dreams. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? BUY IT NOW! AND MARCH FOR THE EMPEROR!!!",2024/9/8,en

As an enjoyer of 40k its nice to be eating good again.

This is a masterpiece, I haven't played a game that has made me this happy in a long time. The gameplay, the lore, the graphics, all of it sings of love and care. This game has so many little details that have made me and my friends stop and appreciated them (not mentioning which in order to avoid spoiling).

The gameplay is visceral and responsive, simple to pick up but with some dept to it.
The lore, according to my more learned friends as I am but a novice in the 40k ways, is very good, and they took great care with some details.
And the graphics are beautiful, the contrast between the amazing visceral displays in combat and the beautiful but war thorn landscape around is amazing.

This topped off with non-predatory monetisation, only cosmetics can be bought, and even then there are plenty to earn in game, the future updates are free and will bring so many wonderful things is such a breath of fresh air.

I know some people had a couple of bugs, and I too experienced some, nothing game breaking, but some crashes and some goofy physics in cutscenes. I am hoping today's patch addressed that for new players.

Всё это в концентрированном виде постоянно присутствует на экране.

结论：中规中矩的战锤40k第三人称射击游戏，没有什么非常出彩的地方。但是玩起来还不错。从没关的挑战上看，Darktide还是对各种数据有着更多的研究，这一代更像是个普通砍砍游戏，没有太多的配合和技能讲究。画面不错，音乐也不错，气氛也不错。目前不支持宽屏，根据roadmap九月份就加入超宽屏支持。皮肤是一堆，喜欢战锤的倒也不是很亏。各项升级都是体现了肝的样子，看起来需要刷很久。

最后吐槽：本人最讨厌Primaris，GW就是喜欢强推自己的棋子。我就是标准30k玩家。为了不吃书，开始往30k里填情节，填故事。Siege of terra系列里的Sons of the selenar就加入了这个狗屁primaris的基因种子，好好好。primaris配U团，真是摆明了的营销棋子策略。最讨厌马桶盖战团，最讨厌primaris，两者兼具，负负得正。但是我变得更恶心了。Horus看着都要吐了，Fulgrim的JJ也要吐了，Magnus脑袋爆浆，Mortarion浑身上下涌出了白色的液体，Angron因为太恶心所以打算砍掉自己的脑袋然后吃了它。就这样，非常恶心。",2024/9/6,zh-cn

จากประสบการณ์ที่เริ่มเล่นตั้งแต่ Day 1 **แบบเข้าถึงล่วงหน้า**
นี่คือเกมแอ็คชัน ผจญภัย สวมบทบาทที่ดีที่สุด ใน ณ. ตอนนี้ หากพูดถึงข้อดีและข้อเสียของเกมนี้:

ข้อดี
- ระบบกราฟิก: เข้าขั้น ""ประทับใจแบบไม่ผิดหวังเลย""
เนื่องจาก ได้ติดตามตั้งแต่ข่าวการประกาศเกมนี้ รวมไปถึง การโฆษณาระบบเกมเพลย์แบบ Demo
นี่คือ **เกมในชีวิตของผมเกมแรก** ที่รู้สึกว่า ไม่มีการดาวน์เกรดใดๆทั้งสิ้น
""Demo มายังไง!! เกมจริงก็มาแบบนั้น!!""

- ระบบเนื้อเรื่อง: มีความ Hype อย่างมาก
ทีมงานทำระบบดังกล่าว ในสเกลที่ใหญ่มาก ทำให้ผู้เล่นรู้สึก มีอารมณ์ร่วมไปกับเกมได้อย่างไม่ยากเย็น

โหด มันส์ ครบทุกรูปแบบ
ทางทีมงาน ทำการบ้านมาดีมากๆ ด้วยรูปแบบ และธีมของจักรวาลนี้ จึงมาครบหมด


ไม่ผิดหวังแน่นอน มีความฉลาด และท้าทาย
ด้วยความที่เป็นทีมงานเดียวกันกับ Crysis 2, Killing Floor 2 และ
เห็นชื่อก็รู้เลย

แต่งจนเพลิน ไม่มีที่ติ
มีความหลากหลายเป็นอย่างมาก ถ้าใครที่เป็นแฟนจักรวาลนี้อยู่แล้ว บอกเลยว่า ""ฟินแบบ*2""

เหมือนกำลังดูหนัง ที่เราควบคุมตัวละครได้
""เสียงปืน และกระสุนที่พุ่งใส่ร่างศัตรู"", ""เสียงดาบที่เฉียนเนื้อศัตรู"", ""เสียงกระฉากเนื้อออกเป็นชิ้นๆ""
รวมไปถึง เสียงพากย์ของตัวละครที่มีอารมณ์ร่วมไปกับเหตุการณ์
ทุกอย่างนี้

เกมนี้ มีระบบบรรยายไทย ไม่ต้องห่วงเรื่อง การแปลภาษา ตามทันได้ทุกสถานการณ์

:
ถึงแม้ว่า จักรวาลของเกมนี้ มีความยิ่งใหญ่มากกว่า Helldivers 2 แน่นอน
แต่ระบบเนื้อเรื่องเกมนี้ ที่ย้ำว่า ยังคงมีการประทะกัน แค่เผ่า Tyranids ส่วนใหญ่
ในทางกลับกัน Helldivers 2



เมื่อเล่นเป็นเวลานาน จะเริ่มรู้สึกเบื่อ เพราะภารกิจยังคงไม่หลากหลายพอ
(ขึ้นอยู่กับผู้เล่นแต่ละคน และรอการอัพเดทต่อไป )

มีเพียงเล็กน้อยมากๆ เช่น การสปอนศัตรูอัดหน้า เป็นต้น
(แต่ถือว่ามีน้อยมากๆ ใน Day 1 หากเปรียบเทียบกับเกมอื่นๆ)

มีการแปลที่ดี แต่ยังไม่ดีเยี่ยม มีการใช้คำบางคำ ที่ไม่ตรงต่อสถานการณ์
เช่น ศัพท์ทางการทหาร, ยุทธวิธี, รูปประโยค หรือสำนวนที่ควรจะเป็น เป็นต้น
(ขอชื่นชมทีมงานเป็นอย่างสูง และหวังว่า คอนเมนต์นี้ จะเป็นประโยชน์ต่อทีมงานในการพัฒนาต่อไป)

- หากจะเล่นเกมนี้: ย้ำว่า ตาม System Requirements จริงๆ
(ประสบการณ์ส่วนตัว คือ เปิดแล้ว เนื้อเรื่องค้าง จอดำ เกมดับ ครบเลย)



แต่ถ้าใครชืนชอบ Heavy Bolter Skin + Ultramarine Skin
บวกเงินอีก 300 บาท ก็จะได้ Ultra Edition มาครอง

หากใครที่กำลังรอ หรือตัดสินใจกับเกมนี้

Ai_shuang,1,32.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198286835015/,"在已经2024年的今天，战锤这一IP也快和整电子游戏历史一样度过了几十年，在这个过程中也曾诞生了不少战锤系列的各类型游戏，比如战锤全面战争、末日鼠疫、暗潮等等。而本次的星际战士2作为标准游戏工业的水平展现，也为战锤系列游戏立下了又一个重大工具点。不得不说战锤这一IP是非常幸运的，先不论暗潮与星际战士2后续运营如何，单说游戏总体质量确实很高，隔壁的士官长与战争机器可谓是馋哭了。



本次星际战士2分为3个模式，战役模式玩家扮演泰图斯小队在8日战争中结束敌人的阴谋，而行动模式玩家可以自定义星际战士扮演战役中与泰图斯小队互相接应的小队执行同一战役的不同任务，该模式有职业与武器rpg系统，也承担了游戏中刷刷刷的要素。最后一个是没有数值成长的PVP模式，内置等级仅用来解锁武器使用权限。



本作的整体设计其实非常的传统，3个模式完全分开，各司其职，战役专注与给玩家带来一段近些年十分少见的猛男冒险故事，序章讲述主角从哪里来又准备做什么，结果遭遇意外而进入本篇的故事中去，成为一个小队长，有两位不那么听话的队友，在大事件中先执行各种较小的任务徐徐展开这个世界，有着十分传统的关卡设计，同时每一关都塞入一些当今游戏愈加少见的大场景与多演出脚本。在这个过程中慢慢展示主角与队友的羁绊，最终面对大危机展开决战。这也是老ass游戏的一个特点，就算在游玩前流程被剧透，但当自己真正游玩，看到，听到这些事、这些人物、这些大规模场景在面前发生时仍会感到兴奋与颤栗。



同时在战役中有很多战锤这个系列的经典演绎，熟悉该ip的玩家恐怕还没开始就已经能想象到故事的发展方向，但对于未曾接触过战锤的路人而言该作的剧情也是非常简单直接，前因后果交代的十分清除，没有什么需要额外买小说、漫画才能看懂剧情的谜语人设计，没有太大的理解成本，对外人可谓是十分友好。而对于锤佬而言游戏处处都是细节，比如流程中一段星界军众人抬不起来的大门被星际战士一人抬起，就会让锤佬会心一笑，且这段演出在其他玩家也能简单看出主角的强大。



还有各种经典战锤环节，如旗插兄贵山更有经典剧情：基因原体中十三阿哥基里曼麾下极限军团战团长、胶瘾上头的ICU战神、那个蓝人、全银河最难杀的男人、抱着太空死灵家的电线杆做武器、干爆泰伦巢主、一拳打死战神化身、两拳打爆安哥拉斯狗肉、两颗心脏成为混沌打卡圣地的超级猛男——卡尔加！（和他的担架小队）堂堂登场！堂堂单挑！




游戏本身的打击感与操控感也非常顶级，让玩家真正觉得我们所操控的是个3米高的超级兄贵，无论是因为庞大盔甲导致的走路姿势还是各种近战武器打在泰伦虫族身上都能让玩家感受我们这三十万匹马力的拳头究竟有多强大。
游戏本身的战斗系统也非常独特，吸取了只狼等游戏的优点融入进本作，当然若是你用键鼠游玩一定要将除了wasd外的所有按键都改一遍。在战役中我们拥有两把爆弹枪与一把近战武器，将敌人血量削减到一定程度后敌人会变红进入可处决状态，我们可以隔着老远就按住处决键让我们的角色在无敌状态一个箭步冲上去进行畅快淋漓的处决动画，而且有一点很不错的设定是处决前会取消一切动作后摇。同时游戏中还有个弹刀机制，敌人攻击分红色和蓝色两种，当被攻击时会先看到一个蓝色光效，此时无论玩家处于什么状态，按下弹反键就会直接弹反成功，中间的判断帧给的相对充裕，除了少数连段攻击需要弹两次外，此时我们可以直接开枪进入枪决状态，不过既然枪决是远程处决，那把无敌效果删了也十分合理。同时游戏中没提的一点是红色攻击也可以完美闪避后接枪决，且这游戏所有小怪攻击都可以弹，因此理论上，注意是理论上我们只用近战可以达到这是我的回合，这还是我的回合的战斗。



然后其他设计决定了这套机制并不能完美运行下去，比如泰伦虫族一个虫子的造价在虫巢看来还不如一颗子弹昂贵，直接根你玩虫潮作战不好吗，因此在战役中星际战士面对四周包围的敌人与只能用枪解决的远程兵时也之后在部分间隙用用弹刀。且弹刀虽容易，但也要考虑失败的风险，游戏中玩家的受击受击硬直过大，且经常面对被包围的情况，无论何种难度，有时候一个操作失误就会被连死，这也导致玩家在不熟练的情况下也很少主动去使用这项能力。



不过游戏本身是非常鼓励战斗，我们星际战士首先是拥有一层护盾，无论什么处决都可直接回复护盾。盾碎后掉血后先是虚血，和血缘类似攻击可直接回复虚血，且本作的虚血是一比一保留且时间不短，有时在怪堆里拿大锤打小怪就是你打多少我吸回来多少。



然而本作在关卡流程中塞入了大量远程怪，让上述的很多战法丧失了使用空间，且这游戏的远程怪攻击频率与精准度不低。不过有个设定是击杀远程精英，旁边的小怪会自己死亡，然而这个教程藏在pve角色挑战中，可能制作组在这时默认大伙都是锤佬，知道虫族是蜂巢意识，死一个大工具点周围的小弟都会死亡。



以及制作组用脚填数值，目前部分武器平衡很差，热熔器灭一切，而该世界观中的能量武器在本作却效果一般。最高难度的怪物巨肉，ai和僵尸事件大战时的ai一样不干任何事情，只是有80%的减伤不怎么会死。不过战役总体而言还是建议大伙玩低难度，这样倒也符合原设定中星际战士的强度，毕竟战役除了成就之外并不会有其他任何奖励。若真想挑战高难度还是去pve模式中，毕竟pve后续想升级还必须打高难度，不要像我一样开局直接打最高难度的战役去坐牢，在这个过程中也无瑕欣赏战斗时的脚本演出。



关卡设计方面制作组还是僵尸世界大战做多了，很多关卡有非常强烈的既视感，总体称不上多好，中规中矩的水平。但部分关卡设计就有点粪，比如中间有一关需要手持彭喷火器在鼠堆里防守，在巨多远程怪的情况下需要时不时拿喷火器烧地面以放置机制杀，而如果你是带着两名ai队友打这关更是痛苦，ai什么都不干，输出和总机制只能全交给玩家自己。




本作的渲染风格很独特，不完全拟真，尤其是星际战士的盔甲，更像是使用各种阴影喷涂和做旧的战旗棋子，如果真让锤佬来玩估计单看各个皮肤都能看个好半天。且在pve和pvp中玩家还可自定义盔甲，这时也会发现游戏内战团颜色和现实中旗子油漆颜色名字一致。可能这也是一种商业策略吧，但总体而言不算坏。



不过这里也要引出本作在肝度方面的一些问题，目前首发版本战役和pve各6关，每关长度在一小时左右，而自定义盔甲的很多颜色都需要花费游戏内代币购买，而这个代币需求量十分庞大，目前区区6关的内容量真的很难撑得起玩家长时间的刷刷刷，且pve中每个职业的后续盔甲样式都需要胜利多少局才可解锁，总的算下来如果想全解锁至少需要玩家打204次pve，这真的有点夸张，明明最简单的把各职业的盔甲解锁变成通用就能减少一大半内容量，可惜制作组没有这样选择。



本作的PVP是较为传统的，也不作为制作组重点，很多功能就没想着去做，比如总战绩什么的，而pvp思路的话基本是必须抱团，星际战士的血量非常少，近战攻击还可直接穿盾，总体而言深度不高，不过我比较担心的是我在第一天打PVP的时候就遇到外挂，想举报却发现游戏内根本没有提供举报方式，遇到这种情况只能选择退出，不过退出倒也没有任何惩罚就是了。只能说制作组为了这个PVP而特意添加的小蓝熊并无太大用处，等一切尘埃落定后PVP除了大伙约着一起，不然应该是不太会有人玩。



不过值得一提的是经历过暗潮后我起初对本作的音乐抱有较高期待，但实际打通整个游戏后你问我星际战士2的音乐，我发现我完全想不起来这游戏的音乐是什么样子，不过相对的游戏的音效部分做的非常出色，爆弹枪这种大口径的初膛破空声、枪械内部机构的撞击声。还有个很细节的地方是在设置中玩家可以选择是否带头盔，而这也会直接影响角色对话音效。



总体而言本作是游戏工业下一个非常标准化的产物，有正常偏下的关卡设计，较为独特的战斗系统，也有战斗设计经验不足导致远程小怪强度略高。同时投入了较为充足的资源，且制作组内应该也有真正的锤佬提供想法，将这些资源也真正花在刀刃上，每关都塞上一些高质量CG；知道自己关卡做不好，那就狂堆演出；知道自己体量做不太大，那就在7小时的战役时间内将相关设计密集堆放；知道锤佬想看什么，那就着力在这方面；也知道考虑其他普通玩家的体验，就将整个故事以非常清晰的姿态展现在玩家眼中。这就在当今的欧美游戏业界就显的非常难能可贵了。",2024/9/8,zh-cn

AstartesTV,1,89.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AAAstartes/,"Warhammer Space Marine 2 ist ein fantastisches Spiel, das in fast allen Bereichen überzeugt. Die Grafik ist beeindruckend, die Sounds sind stimmig, und die Waffen fühlen sich einfach großartig an. Ich habe die Kampagne auf der höchsten Schwierigkeit durchgespielt und aktuell zwei Charaktere – einen Verteidiger und einen Zerstörer – auf Level 25.

Die Kampagne ist hervorragend umgesetzt und fängt die düstere, epische Atmosphäre von Warhammer perfekt ein. Man fühlt sich wirklich wie ein Teil dieses riesigen Universums – einfach fantastisch. Auch die Koop-Missionen sind sehr gelungen und machen eine Menge Spaß, allerdings sind die Chaos-Missionen noch etwas unausgewogen.

Der PvP-Modus ist unterhaltsam, aber es gibt noch Luft nach oben. Mit nur drei Spielmodi und etwa fünf Maps ist das Angebot noch recht begrenzt. Zudem fehlt es den Chaos Marines an Anpassungsoptionen, was dem PvP etwas an Tiefe nimmt. Hier sehe ich die größte Schwäche des Spiels.

Das Spiel läuft außerdem extrem stabil. In meiner gesamten Spielzeit hatte ich nur einen einzigen Bug, aber keinen Absturz oder sonstige Probleme – es ist wirklich sehr gut optimiert.

An alle, die sich beschweren, dass es keine Pronomen, Frauen, LGBTQ+ oder andere Repräsentationen gibt: Im echten Leben könnt ihr all das gerne so ausleben, wie ihr wollt, aber in Warhammer geht es nur um Krieg! Lasst das Universum so, wie es seit den 90ern ist. Wenn es euch nicht passt, sucht euch bitte etwas anderes und lasst uns unser Warhammer so lieben, wie es ist: düster und gnadenlos. DARK and GRIM.

С порога заявляю, я не являюсь вахоёбом, я не вешу 150кг, не имею мании к раскрашиванию фигурок и 4090 под потной подмыхой. Но тогда какого чёрта я предзаказал игру за 4.5К? Все довольно просто...

HELLDIVERS ДОРОГИЕ МОИ ГОСПОДА, ДА ДА ПРИПЛЕТАЕМ ФЕВРАЛЬСКИЙ КООП ПРО БРАВЫХ ДЕСАНТНИКОВ (не космо) КОТОРЫЙ 33 РАЗА OБOСРАЛСЯ И В МОМЕНТ РЕЛИЗА ИГРЫ 5 СЕНТЯБРЯ ЛИШЬ ПУКНУЛ ПРО ДАТУ ВЫХОДА ПАТЧА.

Вообщем, решил попытать удачу в вахо-комьюнити и окунутся в мир тестостероновых мужчин честной судьбы, раз стрело-головые пока что занимаются хyй пойми чем.


Если тезисно, игра прям сделана по ГОСТУ 2010 года, геймплей чисто консольные игры того времени по типу; Gears of War или Transformators War of CyberStyl.
Кишко-образные локации начиненные противниками разной степени впитываемости урона, подбираемое оружие на локации, сегменты где ну... обязательно надо что-то оборонять, сtrl c+ctrl v и игра готова.

Да, разработчики пытались привнести ""новшества"" по типу парирования, блока, там... ультимейтов, сочных добиваний которые быстро приедаются, но игра прям веет душком того времени, и это , игра добротно сделана и все же если опустить подьебки в ней есть кое что aхyительное, из WWZ.
Когда на тебя, чела в костюме из комикона (потом объясню почему) несётся рой мелких мразей, которых действительно ДOXYЯ, И ТЫ МОЖЕШЬ ИХ ВСЕХ РАЗОБРАТЬ ПО КОСТОЧКАМ, это подкупает.
Из-за этого в битве ощущениe по типу НЫА НА БЛЯTЬ НА НА ХYЙ УМРИ Я EБAНУТЫЙ. Импакт в игре хорош, звуки бахают и трахают, количеством крови на экране можно перекрасить черное море в красное, космодёсны орут что есть мощи в пылу битвы, вообщем шик.

В игре мало видов уникального оружия (все модификации болтера это не отдельные пушки, сразу говорю), и мало разновидностей врагов.
Да тут вам встретиться
Если говорить про сложность, то проходил сюжет на ангеле смерти по коопу с моим кентом, не могу сказать что сложность прям пuздец пердак обнулился, но игра не совсем справедлива к игроку, у меня ровно 2 претензии:




Про сюжет мне сказать нечего, в силу того что я свечку над 55 толмутами лора не держал, отсылки на знаковые события игры не выкупил, (да и я обычный человек поймите) кроме в голову ничего не приходит.
Классические терки внутри коллектива чтобы придать команде дуболомов хоть чуточку глубины, поиск в течении всех миссий чего-там, сказать кому-то что, неожиданный там поворот, эпик батл в конце с огромной кокус биг чуси болс крагозяброй the end. У меня сюжет уже почти выветрился, хотя прошел игру я вчера.
Дизайн в игре, ну мне сказать нечего кроме как отвал башки, очень красивая и вкусная пилюля, гигантизм с ноткам вахапанка (смешение средневековья и будущего) дают игре свой неповторимый облик, даже через призму пластилина...

Помните я говорил про комикон костюм, так вот я отсылал к графике.
Оптимизация в игре нормальная, на моём сетапе RX5600XT RYZEN 5 3600 (4-ех летний бабуин) игра выдает 45-60 фпс на смешанных (средне-высоко-низкие) настройках. И разумеется люди доeбутся что у меня комп древнее палеозоя, но почему то не у меня одного проблема с недогрузом текстур. Почти все прохождение земля напоминала пнгэшку сартира в приближении Х100, а космостарсы выглядели как нечто среднее между Базом Лайтером, и сыром ( и да игра на SSD 980 SASUNG стоит). Обожаю лого амд перед игрой, прям стандарт качества.

Тут краткo
PVE зашло, классы и прокачка оружия, уникальные миссии которые переплетены (мох) с сюжетом, считайте еще одна компания,
PVP не интересно, не играл. 0/10 тк если бы заинтересовало поставил бы 10/10

Does it deliver? I will explain below, starting with the campaign, then the MP modes ending on the technical details and overall thoughts.

Campaign


Space Marine 2 puts you into the armour of a Space Marine 40.000 years into the future. A genetically engineered super soldier that is 3 metres tall, a space marine is almost indestructible, they are faster and stronger than any normal human and some of them can be hundreds of years old. They are wrapped in myth and legend and are skilled warriors beyond measure. They are a bulwark against terror in a universe that has known only war for centuries.

Humanity is fighting against horrors beyond their comprehension and while there are several factions of said horrors, the main one we're dealing with here, is a Tyranid Hive fleet.
Tyranids are a bug/lizard like faction that swarm the universe to consume biomass, they evolve at an incredibly fast rate and can counter almost any known weapon or biological agent known to mankind and speed is of the essence when dealing with them. A planet attacked by them never truly recovers and there are millions and millions gunning for you.

The story picks up quite some time after Space Marine 1, and you are Titus. While I won't go into much story detail. The tutorial and thus the introduction to Space Marine 2, immediately shows what stakes you're up against and sets the tone for the entire campaign.

The campaign is a great introduction to some of the scale that Warhammer 40K offers and its bleak hopeless setting, there is only war and it shows. The campaign is filled with gigantic set pieces, wild lush alien forests and jungles, gigantic cities with massive cathedrals or abandoned bunkers and dark secrets. Everywhere you see signs of the carnage that happens all around you and the grimdark setting that 40K invented really shines here.

Gameplay wise the game is reminiscent of Space Marine 1, just improved upon. combat is fast and diverse and the game expects you to switch tactics on the fly.

As a space marine you have a great arsenal of weapons to use, from the infamous Bolt weapons, massive assault weapons that fire a bolt, a massive rocket propelled round that embeds itself in the target and detonates, to melta guns, plasma guns, heavy bolters. But you also have several melee weapons, from the Chainsword, to the Thunderhammer. Why? because the combat in this games switches between thinning out hordes and hordes of enemies before they reach you and then turns into a hack and slash brawler fest.

The combat is incredibly dynamic and it keeps you on your toes especially on higher difficulties. Luckily you are not alone in this rigorous slaughter fest. Titus has two other space marines with him, which can either be controlled by your friends or the computer. While the bots lack some finesse and tend to focus on direct threats, they are a welcome addition. Just don't expect too much of them, they are bots. they beeline for you to get you up if you're down but not out and they can distract some enemies.

The campaign will take you around 10 to 12 hours to complete and my time with it was enjoyed very much, I had several ""Holy sh!t"" moments and I felt like a space marine, the story is all I hoped for after 13 years and I loved it.


The multiplayer is the other part of Space Marine 2. It can be separated in two parts: PVE and PVP.


PVE is one of the parts that shines here, during the campaign several squads often help Titus with secondary objectives, the PVE or Operations gives you control of these squads. You can run this with up to two of your friends or bots, but trust me, play with friends.

You have six classes with each of them having a distinct role, weapon set and main ability.
From the standard space marine with bolter and chainsword, to the bulwark with shield and sword to a stealthy sniper

Each class has weapon upgrades, perks for the weapons and the class itself and customisation to unlock.
Yes you can create your very own space marine or unlock several other space marine chapters and customise those and while the customisation needs some polish, it's incredibly varied.

There are currently six operations most of which coincide with the campaign, they can take 30 to 45 minutes to complete and on higher difficulties they require coordination, tactics and sharing of resources.

They often feel like mini raids and they are incredibly fun to do, however in contrast to games such as Darktide I wonder how fun these missions stay, they feel less like a horde shooter and more like a mini campaign, while enemy variety and objectives can switch around in an operation, I feel it might get repetitive. Yet they are like I said incredibly fun and I will probably keep coming back to them, just because of the gameplay loop.


The second MP mode is Eternal War, a 6v6 PVP mode with the same classes as the Operations mode, just different progression. There three modes, King of the Hill, Seize ground (several points to capture) and Annihilation (team death match) and as of writing 3 maps.

The gameplay in pvp is great, classes are diverse and while some balancing might be happening it is incredibly fun to play despite it's lack of maps and modes. I spend several hours playing this and the tactical aspect in it is really fun, it isn't just run and gun, you have to counter other classes, bullwarks can block damage, snipers sneak around, assault's jump in to cut you down. There are tons of cool skirmishes to be found and it's an absolute blast.

However it's also the most bare bones part of the game. While the customisation for space marines is great, the chaos marines lack customisation, every class is attached to a traitor legion and is thus bound to it. You cannot play an iron warrior vanguard for instance and the armor itself is barely customisable, sometimes even not. For some of the more chaos minded players this can be quite a big letdown.

The other issue is that while it is 6v6 I can only make a lobby with three people, not six or four, locking out some of my friends to play with, I get it for PVE, I don't for PVP.

PVP feels like something added later in development and I hope that the devs do expand upon it with some much needed Quality of Life changes.


The game is quite CPU heavy, I have a i9-10850k CPU and a RTX4070 TI SUPER, the game runs like a charm in 90% of the game, but some areas and missions are incredible heavy on the CPU so much I wonder if it's a bit of optimalisation. Some area's that are small tank my frames, while some large open areas I run at a solid 80 FPS on ultra settings.

Besides that though, the game is beautiful to look at and effects, lighting, textures are all incredibly impressive, from the sparks of a broken cable to the blood that flies around.

The sound design is really well done and weapon sounds pack the punch you expect them to, every bolt fired, every enemy screech, every punch thrown is of high quality and this combined with the graphical design makes this a very immersive 40K game.


Despite some personal gripes and an in my opinion a bare bones PVP, this game has been worth the wait, it build upon the foundation of Space Marine 1 and improved it immensely. It offers something for older fans and something for newer fans of 40K and it is an incredible home-coming or introduction to the Space Marine franchise and thus Warhammer 40.000. It's an incredibly brutal, fun third person action game and the gameplay loop is quite addicting.

Sabre shows it understands 40K and this game is an ode to it.

CoalFire,1,77.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CoalFire/,"Campaign: one of the best I've played in recent memory - this is the only part I can recommend
PvE: repetitive and loses steam after about 3 runs of each map
PvP: not my jam, no opinion, have not played

Overall the combat and general gameplay is some of the most satisfying I've seen since something like Gears but without all the cover nonsense and the first run of the campaign has some real jaw dropping moments in both visuals and reveals.

However, if you're looking for more than the campaign, this is hard to recommend. Much like Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood, World War Z, Darktide, etc, there's just nothing to do in the PvE Operations mode except grind out cosmetics and passives. That might be enough for some, but it lacks any of the systems that make something like Destiny, Warframe, Deep Rock Galactic, Remnant, or the plethora of other rougelikes out there that do so much with mapgen and other secondary systems that make each run feel like a run, not just going through the same motions again. I'm never excited by anything that's gonna drop from a mission, it's just ""cross the finish line this many times"" for your next passive/cosmetic.

Cosmetics are awesome, classes are fine, progression kinda sucks since you only unlock one row at a time. Not sure I'll be playing long enough to max a single class despite only playing two of them. Passives are... there? They all feel like relatively minor gameplay bonuses that help steer your playstyle, but not one so far has made me excited to unlock or feel it was worth working towards. They feel more like bypasses to some inconvenince rather than some Astartes-level power. I don't think I'd be able to tell an endgame level build from an early game one from gameplay alone.

Would be awesome if in new game + you could play the campaign with your custom marine so 60% of the PvE missions were playable with the PvE classes. I think that's my biggest issue, the best PvE content isn't what you get to replay for progression and what's there to replay gets stale fast. Really hope to see some updates to the operations modes that make them more fun to replay. Modifiers, loot drops that persist after a play session, consumable buffs, unique mission rewards, map variants, mapgen, really anything except playing the same mission over and over with some different combat pacing each time.

This review is coming from a perspective of a 40k fan. I am relatively new though, only 5 years ago did I discover this universe, which is quite recent for a universe thats been around since 1987. Since my intoduction I have several painted armies (a space marine one among them) alongside having played some games and listened to a lot of Warhammer books and lore over the years.

Warhammer 40K : Space Marine 2 is a game that absolutely delivers on the experience it was aiming to create while going above and beyond for some aspects while fumbling tiny things along the way. I am pointing this out because this is getting increasingly unusual in the game industry nowadays. Most games coming out trying to sell you a live service while the game is not finished enough to be able to do so. Meanwhile this dev team seems to have taken their time to release a complete product that gives a solid foundation to making a live service work. 3 separate modes, all with a different focus and gameplay experience. Its quite refreshing, but that does not make the game automatically perfect. Lets talk about all of these modes and my thoughts on them.

Campaign: (no spoilers)

This mode continues the story of Demitrian Titus, the protagonist of the first game, with a fancy new narrative 13 years after the games release. Just like the other modes, you can play this mode cooperatively with 2 of your friends, and does a nice job introducing the mechanics of the game in a fun way. The campaign itself is short but sweet, and intentionally tries not to drag on to long, which is good in my opinion because you can't do much character work with a space marine because they are emotionless supersoldiers. The appeal of the campaign are the missions, and the set pieces within them. The 40k universe is bombastic yet intriguing and mysterious, and watching Titus and his team fight through futuristic gothic cities actively being destroyed by the tyranid invasion one moment and navigating through his chapters space ship with tons of details and lore is really fun and engaging. Its like a rollercoaster ride of the 40k universe where they show a lot of the unique and awesome stuff this universe has to offer. I do think it would have been smart of explain some more concepts, especially the ones directly related to the story's plot. A lot of times characters talk about in universe concepts, and people who are new to 40K will just not understand because its never explained. Its tottally playable and comprehensible to a person new going in, but I think its important to explain more stuff to really get them excited about the nuance 40k has compared to other sci-fi universes.

PVE Operations:
This mode allows your to play several missions losely related to the campaign story. Instead of Titus and his squad, you'll be able to play as 6 different classes, and make your own Space Marine. You'll be able to fully customize the look of your character, while completing missions allows you to level up and access new perks and abilities to make your guy stronger over time and really pick a playstyle you like. For 40k fans this is a dream come true since building and painting miniatures is a huge part of this hobby and the amount of customization is pretty vast for game that has just released. Its also not tied to microtransactions and all of the customization (except for a couple skins related to the gold and ultra edition) are earnable through playing the game. No ingame cash shop or lootboxes. The gamemode focusses on replayability with a good variety of maps, enemies and classes alongside the 4, soon to be 5 difficulties, makes it enjoyable over a long period of time. There is also an AI director tha mixes the missions up and tries to suprise you with changes in the enemies that show up and the objectives you must complete along the way. I have some issues with balancing though. The hardest difficulty feels very unstable to play right now, it feels you need to get lucky in order to win, but it’s very satisfying once you do. I also think the Thousand Sons faction are not very fun to fight currently of the way the units are balanced, totally fixable though. Focus has already promised to add more missions, weapons and enemies in the future which will be important to its life service, which in my opinion has the most potential in this game mode.

PVP Eternal War:

I played the least amount of PVP up until now, but it has pleasantly surprised me. It’s structured as a 6vs6 contest where Space Marines go up against Chaos Space Marines, marines who have betrayed the imperium and have sided with the bad guys. There are a couple modes to pick from, and they are all good fun to play with the same 6 classes from PVE. There only 3 maps though, and unlike the Campaign and PVE, there is not a lot of spectacle going on around or inside of them. Instead, this mode is focused on giving you a more competitive experiences, the 6 classes are all rebalanced to facilitate skill expression and game knowledge. The more you play, the more stuff you unlock for your class and once you get the hang of its surprisingly fun and way more intricate than you thought at first. Don’t overlook it, it might be really your thing.

Conclusion:

To me a perfect game is one that gets a lot of little things right, but at the same time, its art, and how it makes you feel is more important than examining and criticizing every detail. Space Marine 2 gives you the power fantasy of you being among the ranks of the Adeptus Astartes, something every Warhammer nerd fantasizes about ever since they started painting miniatures or reading/listening to the lore of this amazing universe. You get to go along this personal story of Titus to see something curated and then make your own based on the space marine you decide to make for PVE and PVP. The core gameplay is rock-solid and satisfying, with a lot of inspiration taken from DOOM while keeping its own style from the previous game. Artistically and graphically the game looks exactly like fans would envision the 40K universe alongside the overall sound design being a straight 10. The performance overall is impressive considering how many enemies can appear on screen on top of the orchestra of chaos that’s happening around you.

This by far is the best 40k game I’ve played so far and deserves all the praise and occasional criticism its receiving. I think thats because people, particularly 40k fans, care about this game and its future; the developers have created an awesome foundation for years of live service support and seem committed to fixing issues through their transparent feedback system. The game has already succeeded critically and financially, now it’s up to the devs build on it. If they do, and they are going to from the looks of their roadmap and their history as a developer, I’ll be there playing who knows how many years from now. If they somehow don’t, this game is still an incredible game and is easily worth the 60 you put in.

Every single gameplay aspect has something holding it back:

- Melee (not enough stagger/damage on higher difficulties especially annoying with the hammer),
- Shooting (barely any gun feels powerful and most of them sound weak too, it's just a feeling though damage is ok)

- Executions/Finishers and other animations where you cant control your character do not have enough invulnerability frames so you take lots of damage without any means to avoid it.

In the end it doesn't matter cause you still feel like a Space Marine and some of the missions are breathtakingly beautiful, just not the second coming of Christ that most of people are telling me this game is.

Kuranes,1,30.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkchant_es/,"En el momento de realizar esta reseña llevo acumuladas 13 horas de juego, principalmente en el modo Campaña y algo del modo Operaciones, y el juego, aunque tiene algunos apartados a mejorar, roza el sobresaliente.

Mi experiencia se basa sobre todo en el modo de dificultad Veterano y jugando con amigos en cooperativo, ya que pienso que esta es la auténtica y mejor experiencia que el juego ofrece. Superar al extremo una situación que parecía imposible y que todo tu equipo sienta la euforia de la victoria es una gran experiencia.

El juego es un portento a nivel visual, y al menos para equipos modernos está bien optimizado, permitiendo jugar en modo Calidad con bastante fluidez a la que tengas un equipo decente. La ambientación, el mundo de Warhammer 40K, los seres que lo habitan y la escala de sus conflictos están perfectamente recreados. Es increíble la cantidad de cosas que llegan a suceder en pantalla sin que el rendimiento se resienta.

Aunque el transcurso del juego sea lineal, los escenarios son bastante amplios, ricos en detalles y tienen bastantes recovecos donde se esconden alijos de armamento, recursos o secretos. Dicho esto, en este caso la linealidad, lejos de ser algo negativo, le sienta perfectamente al juego, ya que la intensidad y la tensión del conflicto se perderían con un mundo más abierto. Tal vez sí estaría bien contar con mayor exploración y opciones en la Barcaza, pero es algo que ya está planeado para futuras temporadas.

La personalización de los personajes de los modos multijugador está bastante bien, aunque echo en falta más variedad de piezas, y sobre todo poder cambiar el rostro del personaje (¡Quiero a mi lobo espacial barbudo y pelirojo!), pero confío en que estas opciones que faltan lleguen con expansiones de contenido.

A nivel jugable ofrece un sistema de combate bastante más profundo de lo que cabría esperar en un principio, ya que cuenta con un sistema de combos en el que puedes detonar un ataque potente en cualquier momento, de forma que cuanto más esperes para hacerlo mayor será el riesgo, pero también el daño causado a los enemigos. Por ejemplo, si lo detonamos en el primer ataque, daremos una patada, en el segundo un empujón y en tercero un pisotón que lanzará a los enemigos por los aires y los aturdirá.

También cuenta con un sistema de bloqueos (parry) y esquivas, que bien utilizados nos permitirán también aturdir a los enemigos y acabar con ellos rápidamente, para regenerar nuestros escudos, aumentando nuestra capacidad de supervivencia.

En cuanto a las armas a distancia, la sensación a los mandos es buena, aunque bastante similar a lo que ya hemos visto en muchos otros juegos de acción. Eso sí, tanto en combate a melee como a distancia, el juego ofrece una enorme variedad de armas, así que tendremos que decidir cuál utilizar en cada situación o cuál se adapta mejor a nuestro estilo de juego.

Por último, en combate cada personaje o clase tiene una habilidad especial única que se tiene que cargar antes de ser utilizada, pero que nos permite en muchas ocasiones darle la vuelta a una situación desfavorable.

En nivel Veterano, el juego dista mucho de ser un mata-mata, siendo necesario analizar el entorno, identificar las mejores zonas donde buscar cobertura, o dónde emboscar a los enemigos, así como trazar un plan entre todos los jugadores para optimizar sus esfuerzos.

Como puntos negativos, destacaría algunos errores puntuales que hacen que nuestro personaje atraviese elementos que no debería, algún enemigo que se queda atrapado con algún elemento del escenario, unas animaciones faciales que podrían ser algo más expresivas y las desconexiones del servidor, que aunque no son algo frecuente, cuando ocurren son bastante molestas. También hubiese estado bien contar con algo más de variedad de situaciones, ya que a pesar de que cuenta con algunos momentos especiales, otros tantos se repiten demasiado. Y por último, algún menú puede llegar a ser confuso al principio.

En resumen, a falta de probar el PVP, y que algunos de los errores comentados se vaya corrigiendo, me parece un juego que todo seguidor del género de acción o del mundo de Warhammer 40K debería probar, sobre todo en su modo cooperativo, tanto en Campaña como en Operaciones, ya que es un juego bastante bueno y lo será aún más con las expansiones que están por venir.",2024/9/9,es

Encoutered a few annoyances:
- menuing not being too convinient (mostly, I dislike that it takes two screens to set the difficulty+mission combo in the coop mode - it really really REALLY should be one screen). I'd love to see this polished up.
- the game will queue you into lobbies where someone is already playing your class, forcing you to change your class. I feel like that's a bit meh, since I enjoy playing one class for long sessions.
- very rarely (happened about three times in the 18 hours I've played so far) the game will lock you in place for a few seconds after a finisher animation - you're invincible and it'll recover, but it ruins the momentum, allowing the enemies to move away, which is a slight problem for any melee class.

And that's about it. Everything else is awesome. This feels exactly how I'd imagine a supersoldier smashing through the battlefield. The combat system has this heaviness to it, and your hits matter.

我妻渡,0,30.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/woqidu/,"游戏的底子很不错，不管是音乐建模场景都做得很好很有代入感，战役的体验我能给八分，就是有点不够玩。
至于这个联机PVE模式，不管是奖励，难度还是服务器，三个方面都很让人不满意。
一，奖励层面
一把游戏辛辛苦苦打下来，流程基本上是30分钟往上，花了很多的时间精力，但是给的奖励很少。经验和货币都很抠，而且最让人恶心的是基因种子和武器数据都要你自己找，本来地图就很大了，东西要自己找，位置还是随机的有时候一把打下来还没找到。这点给人的挫败感特别强。
希望能做一些优化，至少改成一把打完结算就能给一个武器数据和基因种子吧。
二，难度方面
这个游戏的PVE难度真的是我见过最难的几个，玩家可以操控的角色的机体性能甚至没有隔壁暗潮的贼配军强，动作僵直很大，人物也很脆很脆，而且打高难度的话很难回复血量一直都是危险线。
还有刷的精英和小怪，你打精英就会被小怪潮围住，你清小怪就会被精英各种恶心，导致我玩起来觉得我被奸奇和泰伦霸凌了。你说你就算不是个爽游，至少也不能是个联机魂游吧，大部分玩家是想来解压来爽的，不是来赎罪远征来坐牢的。
三，服务器方面
这个服务器真的烂，我以为隔壁暗潮已经是亚空间服务器了，我打了200小时暗潮也只是偶尔会遇到掉线闪退连不上的问题。你这一个主打联机体验，长线运营的游戏，服务器比亚空间还可怕，不是卡加载，就是连不上。跟朋友联机不是他掉就是我掉，真的太差劲了。
只能说这游戏的底子真的蛮不错的，只要能把难度优化好，服务器整的正常一点，多给点奖励降降肝度，还是能变成一个很好的游戏的。在他把这一切做好之前我这个差评不会改的。",2024/9/9,zh-cn

As a 40K fan from the books to the games, I am overly pleased and blown away at the game's detail, gameplay and scope.

The gameplay is clearly a step-up from the simplicity of the first game, adding in just the right amount of abilities, combat mechanics and weaponry.

The campaign's story is hype and larger in scope compared to the first game.

The PvE missions which are closely tied to the campaign are impressive and fun (adds to replayability). At some points I was reminded of Destiny's raids in terms of scale and puzzles (just slimmed down). I am very excited to hear that more of these PvE ops will be added for free in the future. Eternal War PvP is short and sweet, along with what feels like a good balance of classes and perks.

The game's linear progression in the campaign and short single-player reminds me of games from a decade ago, matching the first game's length. If you really enjoyed the first one, this is your new best friend.

Technical issues like crashing in loading screens, crashing after mission completes, server drops, and other small bugs are occasional but not extreme.

Cutlass,0,51.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/uredoom/,"let me preface this review, it is amazing fun, its beautiful on PC with smooth controls, its campaign is fantastic, a decent amount of customisation rounds it all out, I can see myself able to play this game for many hours.

However, there are some issues, some normal for any games launch as disappointing as they are, some decisions that are just outright stupid until these are fixed even though I love it I cant recommend it.

first and foremost, offline progress is not counted towards your account in operations, now some people have said its an anti cheating measure and I can see that perspective however it pails in comparison to the complete struggle that is trying to play the game in online, as you can expect, like many games of this era online play is wrought with server issues, disconnects mid session, finding it near impossible to get a game going, lag-spikes and jittering all the common symptoms, what this equates too is a game that forces you to play online to progress your account, while being barely able to support online play at all.

this carry's on, if you get disconnected mid session which is very common, you lose all progress, all rewards collected in the mission, you cannot rejoin the game in a standard manner, you cannot carry on the mission with bots in offline mode (even if you could no rewards are likely still an issue.) you get the pure pleasure of being told to go stuff yourself and restart from scratch, one only has so many hours in a day, don't make us waste them.

it is mind blowing to me how one can create a game as beautiful and fun as this and then completely drop the ball at what is completely bloody obvious, the game at launch WILL have server issues, so here's a crack brained idea, maybe don't punish all of your players for the possible action of 1% of players that will cheat in offline mode, in a PVE mission mode if that even was the reasoning behind this decision, its truly mind boggling, Total Biscuit would call it a piece of art with a dumb-ass poking holes in it with a pitchfork, Saber are actively harming players with weak or intermittent internet signals, which makes up a far greater majority, even when the server issues are fixed, which I am sure they are working on.

There are game breaking bugs as well, if you die in some campaign missions on harder difficulties, the ammo boxes disappear, with no spoilers, this makes the mission impossible to progress, not because you cant just chain sword them, but there are enemies and objects you have to shoot, with no ammo to do so.

until bug fixes are done, offline mode grants progression, the servers are fixed, and some truly baffling decisions are reassessed I strongly recommend waiting for the game to go on sale which by then it will hopefully be fixed, or borrow the game and enjoy the best parts about it offline.

you have every part of a great meal here Saber, stop messing it up, you are proactively harming players.",2024/9/8,en

Uh...well...
There's Space marines
Loading screens
And buggy cutscenes...

Oh and chainswords....
Mother
F*cking
C H A I N S W O R D S !

In all seriousness yeah its an alright enough game with a short but decent campaign (albeit some aforementioned cutscene errors or bugs such as where they either freeze but the audio continues or its the opposite of the audio lagging behind the visuals of a cutscene).

Combats fun allowing you to pull off some cool as finishers to enemies to regain health and shields (finishing moves in action games is always a win) but some of the controls can feel quite janky with awkward keybinds set by the game for pc.

The operations co-op mode currently has an error where you can get stuck in the hub after readying up for a level and would certainly benefit from some variety, otherwise the same 6 levels could get repetitive for some people, I like to think of it like its Left 4 Dead where you can play through the same levels countless times but the game play is what keeps it fun, but some more random/less linear objectives if possible could probably help make the levels feel less repetitive.
With hopefully some more content and additions operations mode can hopefully reach just a bit more of the potential that it does offer, but still simply just co-op romping with some friends or random allies and curb stomping aliens together are fun solid foundations, hopefully it can just be improved upon.

There's a PVP multiplayer mode where you play as the space marines faction or the Chaos marine (evil hellish marines) faction and fight each other. I haven't played much of it myself but yeah its alright, its there for those who want it.
You can't unfortunately customise the Chaos faction characters, you get premade models for each of the classes on that side, which while they do look cool themselves, does seam like some people are still let down that you can't customise them as well like you can with the space marines.
As far as I've seen theres not many like cool takedowns or anything you can do to enemy players, its just clunky space marines on both sides blasting or thwacking each other clumsily like its a call of duty game and using their ultimate abilities non-stop with no cohesion to see who dies first, then respawning with your abilities charged again to rush back into the fight and repeat the process. Yeah its alright for those who may like the PVP stuff but personally I think the PVE stuff's more the games strong point.

Both the Co-op mode and PVP mode have separate level progressions though so don't think you can level up a class in co-op mode then pop into PVP with a skilled up PVE dude and stomp fools, which is fair BUT however, while class level progression is separate for each mode. You can still unlock cosmetics currency and armour pieces for your characters just by completing matches in both modes as each character. So you can still play both modes and they still count for cosmetic progress at least for each class you beat a match as, so thats nice.

Yeah look, TLDR: Its a decent co-op game and being able to run around and stomp out enemies with allies while playing as giant f*ck off power armoured boys is still awesome. Heck I'm not a big Warhammer series fan myself meaning I knew bugger all about the lore, but I am starting to learn some things about the universe by playing this game and its encouraged me to look a bit more into it.

And you don't need to be a fan of the franchise or know everything to enjoy the game, I'm a simple fella, I saw big mech suits, chainsaws and brutally ripping alien scum to shreads... and thats all I wanted from it.

So its still a solid cool game to play and have fun wreaking havoc on enemies with your big space marine ruthlessness and brutality. But I think it would benefit from some more additions and content, the foundation is there, just build on it and add more levels, and maybe some variety in objectives to keep the co-op mode from becoming stale.

P.S The Season Pass content cosmetics have been a bit disappointing so far, Its just more colours and decals really, I was hoping for more unique/cool and actual standout armour pieces or such to justify its content but so far it leaves alot to be desired IMO.",2024/9/8,en
Therapist Aku,1,20.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CoollizardKaldrogk/,"This game has the feel and vibe of a game made in the late 2000s, early 2010s. The way the multiplayer and the PvE modes play wouldn't be out of place in that era, minus the graphics. This isn't as common nowadays, if at all. So in a weird way, it's a refreshing change that I don't hate at all.

The game currently lacks any microtransactions, and apparently there's no concrete plans for modern microtransaction models. You want new cosmetics? Play the game modes. You want new weapons? Play the game modes. This is good. I like this.

The gameplay feels similar to how the first Space Marine did, with significant improvements in some areas, and a few missteps. The biggest issue comes in the form of the difficulty, as some enemies are just obnoxiously too powerful on their own, with the methods that they swarm you making it all the worse to deal with. This really only is an issue I've found with the Tyranids. The moment you get to your second set of enemies, it's nowhere near as bad.

Hexnaught,1,68.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hexnaught/,"Story is about 10 hours of gameplay (including doing the side coop missions at least once, that are part of the story, but also the content you grind after) and I enjoyed it for what it was. I think this is a great intro to the 40k universe/lore for people new to it.

The gameplay is fun and with the classes and guns available right now there is enough variation to enjoy and keep playing. Where the game does lack though, is the mission content. The re-playable/grind-able missions I feel will get a bit boring after maybe 20-30 hours of grinding them. There is some variation in spawns (elites/bosses can spawn in certain parts of the mission path) but with the few missions that you can run, it isn't enough. Granted the devs plan to expand this later.

There is a PVP mode that will extend the games life a bit but I am yet to try it, although I think it is probably gonna be quite fun.

The game looks beautiful and runs smooth for me (7950x3d, 4090FE, 64gb 6000mhz ram) with the only issue being - when I try to quit the game, it doesn't actually quit. I have to kill it manually.

Overall, id recommend this but if you are only here for the story - wait for it to be expanded with DLC releases or wait for the game to go on a 50% sale. I also got the ultra edition - don't do this unless you just want to support the game, the content it gives you over the Gold isn't really worth it.

Arnold Braunschweiger,1,21,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000162778/,"Fantastic. It’s exactly what you'd expect from a sequel to 2011’s Space Marine and a Warhammer 40K action game. It takes everything that made the first game fun and cranks it up, refining pretty much everything that you remember about that original game.

I never followed the details about the story prior to the release so I wasn't sure if it's gonna pick up from where the last game left off. But I was pleased to see that not only does it still feature Captain Titus as the main character, but also manages to be an overall much better story with a couple of fun memberberries thrown in for fans of the original.

And if you're really invested in the lore, you'll be pleased to know that the developers poured a lot of heart and attention into making this an accurate 40K experience. It's probably the most authentic ""play as a Space Marine"" experience to date, because you truly feel like an eight-foot-tall truck on legs, towering over regular humans and barreling through everything like an elephant in a china shop. Including any living thing that isn't at least as big, because it's going to end up getting stomped like a grape. Everything about this game's design is just as over-the-top, excessive, and ludicrous as you'd expect, and it's glorious.

Mr. Bear,1,45.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/misiok1234/,"This is in my honest opinion the best Warhammer 40k game we've ever had. It does a lot of things very well, and very little outright bad.

The story is good but nothing mind-bending. There's the usual 40k war drama. A few nice twists, and some truly breath catching moments. All of that is if you're a fan of the setting.

If you're not, or yet undecided, then this is a very good entry point. The game does an amazing job showing the scale of conflicts that take place in the universe. Then it impresses you with its visuals and sound design and does not stop.


Things of note, multiplayer (both PVE and PVP) have customization, and the story clocked for me at around 12 hours at the hardest difficulty. Performance seems good enough, though people mention crashing and CPUs going very hot, so keep that in mind.

And well, that's it. It's a great game. It looks great, it plays great, and it sounds great.",2024/9/8,en
Drugrace,1,33.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198426457434/,"Одна из немногих игр вышедших не говном с багами на релизе, что странно.
За первые 11 часов игры могу сказать, что кооперативные операции неплохие, резня реально радует. Прокачка персонажа, косметика, перки, всё присутствует. Можно преобразить своего адского десантника по воему вкусу и настроить каждый элемент брони отдельно, за это плюс.
Из сюжетки прошёл лишь пролог и первую миссию. Главный герой не бесит своими репликами, как в некоторых играх. На данный момент больше сказать по этому поводу нечего.
А вот пвп-режим очень даже порадовал и скучным не кажется. Пока что. Но встретить читера ещё до официального выхода игры, это какой-то анекдот. Или же багоюзеры уже нашли лазейки на бесконечные гранаты, не знаю.

plandekarz,1,38.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/larshustler/,"Space Marine 2 is easily one of the top games in the Warhammer 40K universe. After 13 long years of waiting since the excellent first game, it was absolutely worth the anticipation. To be completely honest, I got my hands on it early thanks to the leak in July, but since I knew I’d be buying the full version (and went all out for the maximum edition), I think that excuses my impatience. I simply couldn't wait!

Campaign

The sequel’s story picks up directly from the first game, even though about 200 years have passed in the timeline. The campaign is as grand as you’d hope, fitting perfectly within the Warhammer 40K universe. Blood, gruesome executions, and limb-tearing battles define this world, and the game delivers on all fronts. While it’s linear and heavily focused on combat, I found the whole experience a ton of fun.

Combat Mechanics

The combat truly nails the feeling of being an unstoppable, armored giant. From the moment you start the campaign it’s clear that you are super-human. The Ultramarines stand out from the surroundings and look like some sort of Titans, with their sheer size making them equals to the Tyranid warriors. The weight and power of your weapons – both melee and ranged – feel spot on, especially when playing with a controller (I’m using an Xbox one). Each hit, shot, and headshot feels impactful, and those bloody finishing moves? Just perfect.

Co-op Mode

A great addition is the new co-op mode. After the introductory mission, you can jump into the campaign with one or two friends, and it works flawlessly. It really amps up the excitement of playing together. If you're playing solo, the AI companions are excellent, so you won’t feel left out.

Multiplayer

And now for the real treat: multiplayer. If you have fond memories of the multiplayer from the original Space Marine, you’re in for a treat. It was brilliant back then and kept me entertained for hours. Now, after 13 years, we finally have what we’ve been waiting for. The multiplayer alone makes Space Marine 2 worth buying. If you're into the Warhammer 40K universe, there’s no better PvP experience out there.

In my opinion, it’s a solid 10/10. Definitely worth checking out!",2024/9/7,en

Короче, определенно тянет на игру года. Разрабы с вниманием к мелочам подошли к игре и могу сказать, что вышло отлично.
Давно не получал такого удовольствия от геймплея и звуков игры.
Ты чувствуешь, что управляешь 300кг махиной и против тебя сражаются ничуть не менее тяжелые представители местной фауны, а иногда и флоры.

Хорошее музыкальное сопровождение, русская озвучка звучит замечательно, за весь сюжет встретил только один баг с взлетом всех персонажей в воздух, ито пофиксилось перезаходом в игру.
Я не прям задрот вахи и лор знаю поверхностно, но ощущения мира переданы на все сто и каждый чавкающий шаг по тиранидам ощущался каждой клеточкой кожи.

Немного про управление - на геймпаде не пробовал, но с компа надо привыкнуть или поменять под себя.
Лично себе настроил прицел на доп кнопку мыши, тк где-то на клаве его искать не удобно, особенно, учитывая обилие других нужных кнопок для игры.
Уровни сложности ощущаются тоже хорошо. На легком ты машина для убийств, на хардкоре ты космодесантник на последнем задании. Тебя сожрут столько раз, сколько того захочет Император.
Лично я выбрал нормал, тк хотел почувствовать игру, а не боль в промежности, но даже на этом уровне сложности игра бросает вызов.
Друзья у меня бедные, потому играл с ботами и... Они тоже не так плохи, как в условном пейдее.

ping-win,1,66.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ping-win/,"Игра офигенная по геймплею, есть свою нюансы на самом деле, но а целом ощущение положительное.

Плюсы:
1. МЯСО. Бой, добивания, охуенно лайк подписка
2. Сюжет компании - круто, интересно. В целом больше для галочки, но для фанатов зайдет
3. Разные классы - разный геймплей. Классы интересные.
4. Много скиллов на прока,ку, возможность прокачки оружия
5. Графика, оптимизация

Спорно:
1. Как то маловато выбора оружия на класс. Их можно качать, но в компании выбор больше. На самом деле это пока не бесит, но просто хотелось бы

Минусы:
1. Всего 6 PvE миссий, у миссий 4 сложности. На каждую сложность нужен определенный уровень персонажа и оружие чтоб ее вообще пройти. Ты можешь прокачать одного, если захочешь другого - все с нуля. С самой низкой сложности. Надеюсь с длс будет больше миссий.
2. Проблемы с соединением - надеюсь это из за раннего доступа, но тут все плохо. Если стартуешь PvE вдвоем постоянно кидает рандома, который не может подключиться, а ты в это время ждёшь. Потом его выкидывает, идёт отсчёт и коннкетится новый. И так по кругу. С PvP тоже проблемы, иногда зависает Коннект к матчу, приходится alt + f4
3. Миссии компании довольно длинные, сложность в компаниях не имеет смысла кроме как если любишь трайхардить. Плюшек за нее не дают.

Очень надеюсь на сезонный пропуск, в котором добавят больше PvE миссий и возможно новые режимы.

Я предполагал на самом деле что она будет похожа на L4D, и она на нее похожа, но с учётом мяса хотелось бы какой то режим чтобы было похоже на хелдайверс, было бы офигенно если бы можно было тоже какую нибудь поддержку вызвать и бвтвы помасштабнне, это была бы имба",2024/9/7,ru

There is so much love and attention to detail in this game that it could truly have only been made by people who are enormous fans of the setting. I don't want to spoil things before the game is even fully out but let me say the scene with the chapter banner was AMAZING and it might not have even been the coolest moment in the game. I constantly felt like I was seeing the stories and miniatures I know so well brought to life, it was a really remarkable thing.

The performance is also like, weirdly good? I only have a 3700x // RX 7800XT and it ran flawlessly all the way through the campaign at 1440P, on Linux no less. It's pretty remarkable. Really feels like the time they spent during the delay was very well spent indeed.

IppoCho,1,49,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198272332363/,"Après avoir passé plus de 16 h sur le jeu, je pense avoir un avis sur le jeu assez bon, même s’il reste quelques problèmes qui, je l’espère, seront réglés à la sortie ou peut-être via d’autres patchs.

Pour les points positifs : 

– Le gunplay est vraiment satisfaisant : par moment, on a vraiment l'impression d'être invincible jusqu'au moment où l'on tombe sur des mobs d'élite, où l'on doit quasiment envoyer 1 voire 2 chargeurs pour les tuer (ce qui est relativement handicapant quand eu en 5 balles nous met 1/4 life !). Mise à part ça contre les petits mobs ou même les boss, on voit vraiment une utilité à spammer avec son bolter.

– Ensuite, pour ce qui est de l'ambiance, musique, environnement, tout y est, c'est un réel plaisir en tant que fan de la licence de voir un jeu aussi bien fait.

– Une campagne super sympa à faire seul ou avec des amis ! (ce qui serait cool, mais surement impossible à faire, serait de rajouter des campagnes de chaque chapitre/légion mise à l'honneur, comme par exemple pour les Dark Angels qui vont être mis à l'honneur courant cette année, mais je rêve un peu trop).

Maintenant, on va passer au point MID, ce qui est bon, mais qui reste à améliorer : 

– Le système de customisation et de classe ! Alors, pour le coup, je m'attendais à quelque chose de fou quand finalement, je me retrouve devant une customisation assez limitée au début où l'on doit payer avec la monnaie du jeu (que l'on débloque en jouant, pas de soucis à se faire sur ce point-là), mais j'ose imaginer que sur le long terme, la customisation sera incroyable (petite pensée aux fans de Space Marine du chaos qui jetaient leurs larmes pour pleurer sur leur customisation ultra– Les serveurs/classes, je vais les mettre au même niveau parce que les deux sont relativement liés ! ET OUI comme dit dans les bande annonce il y a bien 6 classes mais sur les 6 il n'y en a que facilement 2/3 qui sont jouable sinon le reste poubelle ou presque et surtout comme je l'ai dis les serveurs sont de la partie donc ils suffit qu'il y ai 2 personnes qui veulent jouer la même classe en Opération et la partie ne peut pas se lancer et donc une grande partie des serveurs sont sois bloquer car les 2 classes les plus jouable sont prise mais j'ai bonne espoir que ça sera corriger avant la sortie du jeu 

– Un jeu (pour le moment très important à souligner), pour le moment assez répétitif, c'est-à-dire que vous avez 6 missions avec les mêmes objectifs à chaque fois, de temps en temps des boss qui se rajouteraient, mais pas de quoi casser 3 pattes à un canard. (Après, c'est une avant-première pour le moment, la road map est déjà sortie et il y a 4 saisons déjà prévues, donc que de bon pour le moment, y'a juste à espérer que les chiffres ne casse pas la dynamique, car pour le moment où j'écris ce texte, le jeu est très minimaliste).
Et maintenant les points négatifs à améliorer au plus vite, pitié.

– Le corps à corps ! alors très stylé le système de contre y'a pas a dire mais quand il y a une dizaine d’ennemie qui vous tire dessus et vous frappe disons que c'est assez compliquer de le faire ensuite truc assez bête mais imaginer attaquer un mob élite au corps a corps vous lui mettez 1-2 coups vous charger la troisième il vous envois une attaque qui vous stune et votre combo et complètement stopper sans que vous puissiez rien faire tout en sachant qu'il y a surement 2/3 ennemie autour de vous entrain de vous arracher le gosier d'une puissance jamais vu et la rentre en jeu l'une des deux classe jouable la classe rempart une classe avec un simple pistolet une arme au corps a corps et le saint bouclier qui augmente votre chance de survivre a ce carnage au contact de 10% à un solide 50% (je parle de la game entière évidement) et oui dans se jeu malheureusement il n'y a pas de système de défense simple des esquive ou bien le contre sinon vous subissez et vous pleurez en silence puis sans parler sur système d'attaque en générale qui lock absolument tout et n'importe quoi il y a un systeme de lock pour combattre comme il se doit un ennemie au corps a corps mais comme je l'ai dit en règle générale c'est pas du 1vs1 c'est du 15vs1 donc oubliez les assez vite sauf si vous jouez en pvp la il vous sera peut-être plus utile 

-Enfin pour moi le pire du pire c'est la vie elle disparaît si facilement c'est très très grave comme je l'ai dit plus haut vous allez tomber sur des mob élite qui en règle générale tank pas mal donc vous avez plusieurs option soit vous leurs foncez dessus et vous passez la moitiez de la game sans vie soit vous leurs tirez dessus et vous vous armez de patience et vous  envoyez 2 chargeur se 1 seul mob vont aussi vous allumer en moins d'un chargeur (L'avantage de cette option ce qu'il y a des munition tout les 5 mètres c'est a se demander comment elle se retrouve la par moment) alors que le heal et une précieuse ressource que vous trouverais après avoirs fini votre opération surement c'est tellement rare a trouver que si vous en avez allez jouez au loto vous avez vos chance ! il y a bien un bouclier mais honnêtement c'est juste visuel c'est juste pour dire regarder y'a un bouclier qui est complément inutile donc j'attend pas a avoir des ennemi plus nul non j'attend d'avoir un système de protection parce que quand au corps a corps c'est une orgie tous sur moi avec absolument 0 défense juste une belle épée tronçonneuse qui 2 shoot des petit mob alors imaginer mon état après avoir affronter 3 mobs élites au corps a corps ! Ce qui est dommage, honnêtement, on joue des space marines et je me retrouve à hésiter à affronter 3/4 ploucs qui vont surement tank comme des porcs, donc je ne sais pas : soit il faudrait rendre utile le bouclier, ce qui serait bien, soit peut-être augmenter notre résistance ou soit mettre plus de heal, parce que là, j'ai l'impression de jouer au petit chaperon rouge et je ne suis pas du tout le grand méchant loup.

★ Kalko,1,55.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DerKalko/,"Brüder und Schwestern des Imperiums, heute betrachten wir ein Werk, das nicht nur ein Spiel, sondern ein Schlachtfeld der Ehre und des Blutes im Dienst des Imperators ist. Space Marine 2 führt uns erneut in die düstere Zukunft des 41. Jahrtausends, wo es nur Krieg gibt – und es macht dies mit solcher Wucht, dass selbst die härtesten Krieger ehrfürchtig zurückweichen könnten.


- Handlung und Atmosphäre – Der ewige Krieg ruft!

Space Marine 2 setzt die Geschichte des Ultramarines Captain Titus fort, dessen unerschütterliche Loyalität gegenüber dem Imperator und der Menschheit im Mittelpunkt steht. Hier zeigt sich die tiefe Verbindung zur düsteren und brutalen Lore des Warhammer 40k-Universums. Die Atmosphäre ist durchzogen von Verzweiflung und Heldenmut. Jeder Schritt auf den Schlachtfeldern – ob auf verseuchten Planeten oder in den schmutzigen Straßen imperialer Städte – schreit nach dem Schrecken des 41. Jahrtausends. Die Bedrohung durch die Tyraniden ist allgegenwärtig, und die Darstellung dieser xenosrischen Albträume ist wahrlich furchterregend. Ihre Horden wogen wie eine lebendige Flut über die Stellungen der Verteidiger hinweg, und das Spiel fängt die schiere Masse und Grausamkeit dieser Kreaturen meisterhaft ein.

Die Geschichte selbst entfaltet sich als epischer Kampf um das Überleben der Menschheit. Captain Titus, geschmiedet im Feuer zahlloser Schlachten, muss nicht nur gegen äußere Feinde kämpfen, sondern auch gegen innere Zweifel. Die Frage, was es wirklich bedeutet, ein Space Marine zu sein – eine unaufhaltsame Tötungsmaschine oder der letzte Verteidiger der Menschheit –, wird immer wieder aufgegriffen. Doch wer Captain Titus kennt, weiß, dass seine Treue unerschütterlich bleibt, und dies macht ihn zu einem wahrhaft legendären Charakter.


- Gameplay – Der Donner des Bolters und das Heulen der Kettenschwerter

Das Gameplay von Space Marine 2 ist wie ein donnernder Hymnus an den Krieg. Das Spiel fängt die Essenz eines Space Marines perfekt ein: Du bist kein gewöhnlicher Soldat – du bist ein wandelnder Panzer, eine lebendige Waffe des Imperators, gemacht um Tausende von Feinden zu vernichten. Das Gefühl der Macht, wenn man den Abzug eines Bolters drückt und sieht, wie Feinde in Blut und Fleisch explodieren, ist unübertroffen.

Das Nahkampfsystem ist eine brutale Symphonie aus Klingen und Fäusten. Die Kettenschwerter brüllen und sägen sich durch die Reihen der Feinde, während die Schläge eines Energiehammers Wellen der Zerstörung durch ganze Formationen senden. Jeder Treffer, jeder Schlag fühlt sich mächtig an, und die audiovisuelle Umsetzung unterstreicht dies perfekt – von den metallischen Klängen der Servorüstung bis hin zu den knirschenden Knochen und reißenden Sehnen der Feinde.

Neu hinzugefügt wurde eine verfeinerte Mechanik für Ausweichmanöver und taktisches Vorankommen. Dies verleiht den Kämpfen eine zusätzliche strategische Ebene, ohne den Fluss des Blutvergießens zu unterbrechen. Besonders beeindruckend ist die Art, wie das Spiel die Zahl der Gegner handhabt – riesige Schwärme von Tyraniden, die auf dich zustürmen, und du allein, ein wandelnder Gott des Krieges, der sie niedermetzelt. Es ist eine brutale, kathartische Erfahrung, die jeden Warhammer-Fan begeistern wird.


- Grafik und Sound – Ein audiovisuelles Meisterwerk

Die Welt von Warhammer 40k wird in Space Marine 2 mit unglaublicher Detailtreue zum Leben erweckt. Die zerklüfteten Schlachtfelder, die gottlosen Alienarchitekturen und die prächtigen Rüstungen der Space Marines – all dies erstrahlt in glorreicher, blutiger Pracht. Besonders hervorzuheben ist die Gestaltung der Tyraniden. Jedes Glied, jede Kralle und jeder zahnbewehrte Schlund dieser abscheulichen Kreaturen wurde mit Liebe zum Detail geschaffen und wirkt wahrhaft furchteinflößend.

Der Soundtrack begleitet die Kämpfe mit düsteren, epischen Klängen, die dem Spieler das Gefühl geben, Teil eines gewaltigen Kreuzzugs zu sein. Die Geräusche des Schlachtfelds – das Rattern der Bolter, das metallische Brüllen der Rüstungen und das markerschütternde Heulen der Tyraniden – sind so intensiv, dass man fast den Schweiß und das Blut riechen kann.


- Fazit – Im Namen des Imperators, es gibt keinen Vergleich

Space Marine 2 ist nicht nur ein Spiel, sondern eine Erfahrung. Es fängt die Essenz dessen ein, was es bedeutet, ein Space Marine zu sein: ein Krieger, der in einem Universum voller Tod und Chaos kämpft und niemals zurückweicht. Die Mischung aus intensiven, brutalen Kämpfen, der düsteren, tiefgründigen Geschichte und der atemberaubenden audiovisuellen Präsentation macht es zu einem Muss für jeden Fan des Warhammer 40k-Universums – und für jeden, der den Imperator ehren will.

Dieses Spiel ist ein Monument des Krieges, errichtet auf dem Blut und den Knochen der Feinde des Imperators.

Für den Imperator! Für das Imperium! Kein Bedauern, kein Rückzug, nur Sieg!

BB910,1,14.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BB910/,"Oyunu genel olarak çok beğendim ancak şikayetimin olduğu bir kaç nokta var. Birincisi, oyunun yakın dövüş mekaniklerini iyi yaptıkları için sürekli yakın dövüşe girmenize zorlanmanız. Ne alaka diyebilirsiniz şöyle açıklayayım. Canınızın çok az kaldığı ve merminizin de neredeyse bittiği bir an düşünün, karşınızda daha sürüyle düşman var. Koşarak biraz mesafe açmak istiyorsunuz ama yapamıyorsunuz. Çünkü yaratıklar sizden çok daha hızlı ve aralıksız olarak spamlarcasına üstünüze zıplıyorlar. Siz de isteseniz de istemeseniz de yakın dövüşe girmek zorunda kalıyorsunuz çünkü koşarak kaçmaya çalışırsanız %100 öleceksiniz. Böyle sürüyle yaratık öldürdüğünüz bir oyunda düşmanla birazcık mesafemi açıp sonra geri dönüp tekrardan taramaya başlamak istiyorum ve bunu yapamıyorum. Tamam bir saf shooter oyununa göre inanılmaz derinlikli bir yakın dövüş mekaniğiniz var ama kullanmak da zorunda değilim. Zaten farklı tarzlarda oynansın diye 6 farklı class koymuşsunuz. Bırakın isteyen uzaktan sıksın isteyen yakından girsin. Bu uzaktan bakınca saçma bir şikayet gibi görünebilir ancak oyunu normal zorluğun üstüne alıp, iletişim kurduğunuz bir arkadaşınız olmadan oynadığınız zaman dediğimi çok net bir şekilde anlayacaksınız. Bazı noktalar gerçekten hayatta kalmak imkansız hale geliyor çünkü ve oyunun tadı kaçıyor.

İkinci şikayetim de tamamen çıkmış bir oyuna göre az içerik olması. Bu oyunda ana hikaye dışında online olarak oynayacağınız görevler ve bir sürü geliştirme imkanı olan 6 farklı class, üstüne her silahın kendi geliştirmesi var. Ancak oyunda sadece 6 görev var. Evet 6. Ve hiçbiri de o kadar da uzun değil. İleride illaki görev eklenecektir ama yine de başlangıç için çok az. Bu bir erken erişim oyunu olsa anlarım ama şu anda pek anlayabildiğim bir durum değil bu. Karakter geliştirmek falan da o kadar çabuk yapabileceğiniz bir şey değil. Bir classı fullemek baya zaman alıcak gibi duruyo oynadığım kadarıyla. O yüzden acilen yeni görevler eklenmesi lazım. Ayrıca silah çeşitliliği de az ve hali hazırda bulunan silahların bazıları birbirine çok benziyor. Mesela bir silahın normal, dürbünlü veya altında bomba atar olan versiyonu var. Bunlar 3 silah olarak ayrılmış. Biraz çakallık gibi geldi ama neyse ileride umarım çeşitlenir oyun.",2024/9/6,tr

After finishing the campaign I just had to write a review to get my thoughts down on paper, this review will contain no spoilers for the story, but will talk about themes, gameplay and performance. Together of course with an overall impression, to start things off.

Space Marine 2 exceeded my expectations by a significant margin, this game is fun to play. I've seen some other reviews talking about how the combat system is ""unforgiving"", but I can only say that I disagree. The fast paces melee / ranged blend is really satisfying once you figure out what works for you. I played the game on the second to highest difficulty for my first run so far, I had to adjust in the beginning but once I got over the hurdle, quite frankly I just saw myself improving and getting better at managing the fights. To an extent fights in this game feel reminiscent of those from DOOM, specifically Eternal. Every fight is a puzzle that you need to think creatively to solve together with staying on top of incoming attacks and positioning.

Complaints about the AI are valid, but I didn't notice much in terms of them getting in the way of me having fun.

Performance wise, I'm running on a fairly old rig, 1080 and an i7-4790k, and I got stable performance albeit not exceptional on the high preset. For me I am fine if a game runs at 30 as long as it is stable, and Space Marine 2 was, depending on level, either running at stable 30, stable 45, stable 60 or unstable 20-30. The 20-30 range being in some of the later where the game is flexing it's muscle in terms of scale and the number of effects on screen.

As for all the stuff with the Epic integration? Quite literally you accept the EULA and that's it. It has no other impact on your gameplay. I find complaints around this sort of stuff to be valid, if exaggerated. It is okay to be upset that this is ""forced"" upon you, but I do not think it warrants leaving a negative review for the game, personally.

Story? This feels like it could've been a 40k novel. I say that with significant praise, compared to the first game the stakes are higher, the characters are better, and it just feels like a part of actual canon now.

I am incredibly satisfied, and depending on how the game develops in the next few years, it might take the spot for ""My personal favorite 40k game"", as it is now, however? Firmly top 3.

Suffice to say, I strongly recommend this game, I will be diving into the multiplayer and co-op components in the next few days, and if there is anything to add or detract from this review, expect addenda :)

If no addenda are found on this review, my stance holds firm.",2024/9/6,en

Garviel Loken,1,275.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046775834/,"К данной игре будет весьма занятный обзор, ведь я её ждал и хотел получить удовольствие от игрового процесса, но пока получил только кучу лишнего горения.

Пожалуй, стоит для начала отметить плюсы игры:
1) Несомненно внимание к деталям. Атмосфера просто поражает глаз. Очень красивые декорации.
2) Подходящее звуковое сопровождение, да такое, что иногда хочется задержаться на пару мгновений на стартовом экране меню игры.
3) Противники - Тираниды реально ощущаются невообразимым стадом саранчи, просто полчища. Чуть засмотрелся и тебя уже не просто окружили, но еще и высушили.

Теперь поехали по минусам и этапам горения, конкретно в моём случае:
1) Почему купив версию с ранним доступом, я чувствую себя участником Бетатеста? Началось с того, что загрузить игру было невозможно в стиме, хотя кто-то уже катал в неё и не первый час.
2)Почему, при первом запуске я должен танцевать с бубном и угадывать причину краша на экране? Первая сюжетная катсцена, лица Кадианцев и всё, писос, приехали. Обновление драйверов и биоса не дало результатов. Проблема та же. После очередного запуска, каким-то макаром удалось дождаться отклика от программы, прослушать до конца ролик вступительный и приступить к игре...
3)ОШИБКА СЕТЕВОГО ПОДКЛЮЧЕНИЯ. Ну ёкарный бабай. За что? Император не любит меня? Почему кто-то спокойно катает в коопе, а у кого-то стабильное подключение только в меню игры, а при запуске миссии выкидывает в оффлайн режим? К другу соответственно ты тоже не подключишься. Проверил Брэндмауэр - все разрешения выставлены. Так же пробовал отключать и включать кроссплатформу - безрезультатно.
07.09.2024
✅Проблема подключения решена изменением настройки часового пояса и региональных настроек. (Нужно выставить свой часовой пояс в настройках -Панель управления - Дата и Время - Изменить часовой пояс (ставим свой часовой пояс)
И - Пуск - Параметры - Дата и время - поставить галочку на автоматическое определение.

4) Явное отсутствие баланса в ПВЕ режиме с ботами. Запустил первую миссию, выбрал класс Bulwark (Щитоносец) и был приятно удивлен тем ЩИТОМ, который происходил. Два бота, собрата примариса просто офигивали превозмогать в каждой большой волне, ведь появлялись два летающих моба, кастующих зеленые шары. У выбранного щитоносца тупо нехватает боезапаса, что-бы сбить с них защиту или убить с помощью плазменного пистолета. Боезапаса на карте крайне мало, и если уйдёшь дальше. чем нужно - может появится новая волна мобов, которая сделает тебе габельную катку в попытке найти больше патронов. Кто то скажет -""Дурень, щитовик милишник, а не дальний бой"" и будет прав. НО, превозмагать с ботами и ждать, пока они минут за 5-7 уберут двух таких мобов - то еще приключение, потому что ты постоянно должен уворачиваться от летящих сфер, что-бы не потерять лица. Режим контратак иногда плохо ощущается. может из-за мешающих, огромных индикаторов на целях. В общем удовольствия от мили сражений практически не получил.

P.S.
Обзор можно будет изменить на положительный, когда хотя бы часть проблем уйдёт.

El apartado gráfico es de 10 solido, todo cargado de detalles, efectos y una iluminación magnifica, el curro que tiene detrás es espectacular.
Sonido perfecto, acorde con lo que podrías escuchar en cualquiera de las películas de WH40K, es decir, temas ominosos y épicos todo ello acompañado con una gran calidad de sonido de efectos como disparos, enemigos y explosiones.
Quiero destacar el doblaje, tiene 1 único detalle que no me entusiasmó, por algun motivo dicen ""imperium"" en vez de imperio, no es un gran trauma, pero me pareció raro, pero por lo demás muy buena calidad de voces y algo muy chulo, es que puedes cambiar a cualquier idioma disponible en el acto, sin pantallas de carga, lo que te permite, por ejemplo, jugar un rato escuchando el juego en Japones y volver al inicial enseguida.
La historia a la altura del Space Marine 1 pero x4, con buenos personajes y grandes momentos, no busca plantearte nada trascencental, solo que disfrutes del viaje, jugar al 1 es necesario, pero no obligatorio, ya que los detalles que se nombran te los explican durante la historia.
Temas de rendimiento, el caso es que mi poco añejo portatil se lo ha soleado, por lo que 0 problemas, pero seguramente dará algun que otro quebradero de cabeza en equipos más modestos porque ya solo con la cantidad de partículas que tiene tendrás que ser honesto con la cfg por más que duela.
Y alguna cosa más que se me ocurrirá cuando descanse un poco jeje. En resumen, Si te gusta WH40K, este juego es lo que necesitabas aunque no lo supieras ;)

- do grania na dual sense najlepiej wyłaczyc steam input (steam sugeruje to na początku ale patrząc na niektóre komentarze do nie wszystkich to dotarło.

With Space Marine II, Saber interactive proves, once again, that they know how to do action games, this time adding a ton of Co-op & PvP options powered by their squeaky-clean net code. The game runs excellently, looking great and performing to specification. I was able to stream it from the same rig I was playing on, and only got one random crash during my five-hour session. Visuals are great, audio is fantastic, and the writing found here is far better than any game in the genre usually gets. The Swarm Engine that made WWZ what it is comes into play and provides a breathtaking sense of scale to most encounters. The price-tag might be a bit steep, at least when we are talking about the Early Access Versions, but they come packed with the first Season Pass, which will eventually make the investment worth it. If you are looking for a really well-crafted action games to play with your friends, will not disappoint. To War!

You bet your sweet ass I did.

The scale of the set pieces, fan service galore, and all of the Tyranids and Chaos Servants you can ea- um, annihilate, I can feel the love that the devs put into this masterpiece coming inside me.

If you're a fan of 40K, and you liked the original Space Marine game, or you like hack and slash 3PS games, you need to pick this up. This was a labor of love that we may never see again if these f*cking morons leaving negative reviews have their way.

Some sound mixing issues, very few physics based glitches, and absolutely fantastic performance with TWO, COUNT EM TWO hitches in the framerate in my entire playthrough due to I'm guessing shader compilations. This is the most polished game I played in 2024.

И хочу отдать должное Relic Entertainment, ведь эта студия ""заложила основу"" серии.
Так же хочу поблагодарить студию Saber Interactive за ""качественный"" продукт. И довольно неплохой сюжет (хотя честно он коротковат по сравнению с первой частью(чисто мое мнение)).
Боевая система довольно динамичная (даже очень, хочется немного ""старой"")
Окружение вообще бомба, чувствуется ""размах и эпичность""

И последнее я прошу, нет умоляю чтобы Saber Interactive сделала ремастер первой Space Marine!!

I'll say right away that the game is quite good, no, even excellent. A worthy continuation of the first Space Marine.
And I want to give credit to Relic Entertainment, because this studio ""laid the foundation"" of the series.
I also want to thank the Saber Interactive studio for a ""quality"" product. And a pretty good plot (although honestly it is short compared to the first part (purely my opinion)).
The combat system is quite dynamic (even very much, I want a little ""old"")
The environment is generally the bomb, you feel the ""scope and epicness""
I'll give the game 8.5 out of 10 (Titus does not ""read out the thought of the day"", you need to get used to the dynamics of the battle)

LeGurmuX,0,11.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/legurmux/,"The game has immersive and astonishing visuals and gets really the wonder of the Warhammer 40k universe grandeur and epic proportions. This can definitely give some inspiration and feel of ave to anyone really interested in the 40k universe.

The gameplay is quite a copy from Warhammer 40k Darktide, in all aspects of level design, weapon design, visuals. Unfortunately this also mean the gameplay, weapons design and level design and enemies are as they were in Darktide. This game however is not some aspiring storm trooper learning to survive, but this is a game where the player is put into the boots of a Space Marine, as super soldier with genetic and technological superiority, an Emperor's angel that alone can take tides of baddies etc.

The problems are soon too apparent and disturb severely the feel given to the player. Weapons have extreme recoil, they have too low damage and too low range and in many cases even too low ammo capacity. You get the feel of being scared, alone, restricted... Not the feeling of being the best there is going with brave heart towards what might look as if being suicidal odds and still expect to come out as unscratched and victorious. The devs should at least to a minimum add the target enhancing and dark vision to be constant things for the Space Marines, not some random and seldom few second bonuses. Also while at it the recoil should mostly go away as the guys here do have the power armour of the best sort and the usual recoil from heavy weapons is nothing to these guys. More over the also have Auspex inbuilt to their helmets, super senses, dark vision, automatic sensor arrays around them etc. This should give them really good combat awareness at all times and extreme accuracy with any weapons. The weapons are also needing to get some sort of a update... It feels so sad to fire a large caliber bolter at some hormagaunt to only see that it fights on and did not even lose a limb or so, and this happens with EVERY round... It get so annoyingly sad too soon... For some reason they also chose not to copy the sound from Darktide, and bolters, chain swords, power swords etc. all sound so lame (which unfortunaly is also lame in effects too)... These Space Marines should be able to kill things with far more less effort than the game makes you do especially if trying anything but the Easy mode. Also the Space Marine power armour is merely more resilient than the health and life points in Darktide making the player die and suffer in situations that are barely seeming dangerous.

Please devs, make the above fixes to the gameplay and also add much more damage to every marine weapon and especially the Heavy Bolter, Plasma Pistol, Plasma Gun, and Meltagun all need to feel like they are some weapons of mass destruction even against bosses. Just allow us feel like god-like super soldiers and not some decent elite commando guys... Make the armour withstand things much more... Currently the tolerance is just pathetic... And while at it, get rid of the dodge roll animation finally... Just allow the super soldier to take a quick leap of some two meters or so worth... The super quick dodge roll in a 300kg armour just really is like a bad bad thing for the immersion. Movent which btw is otherwise very nicely done to give the character some very heavy feel otherwise with all the noises and thumps and slight slowness. It would also be nice if you devs could get some effects where the enemies lose limbs and weapons while being shot at and losing capability to attack or move along. This way you can still allow the enemies to withstand occasionally some bolt or two extra. MAybe also make the enemies have some weak points where they are wounded heavily with shots instead of just being hp reduction thing for them. Though the melee blocking and execution shots are very nice.

The game has been developed as being another Darktide with different skin and seems like the devs wanted the main game to be the multiplayer deathmatch / team match thing instead of the campaign where you go against tyranids... If wanting to get a feel of being a Space Marine among a tyranid invasion, this is not so much of a giving the feeling, but just baing visually very immersive 40k thingy then,",2024/9/6,en
